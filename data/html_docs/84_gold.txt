Section 1.02 Other Interpretive Provisions.  With reference to this Agreement and each other Loan Document, unless otherwise specified herein or in such other Loan Document:  (a) The definitions of terms herein shall apply equally to the singular and plural forms of the terms defined. Whenever the context may require, any pronoun shall include the corresponding masculine,
feminine and neuter forms. The words include, includes and including shall be deemed to be followed by the phrase without limitation. The word will shall be construed to have the same
meaning and effect as the word shall. Unless the context requires otherwise, (i) any definition of or reference to any agreement, instrument or other document herein shall be construed as referring to such agreement, instrument or
other document 
  32 



as from time to time 

efined herein shall be
construed in conformity with, and all financial data (including financial ratios and other financial calculations) required to be submitted pursuant to this Agreement shall be prepared in conformity with, GAAP applied on a consistent basis, as in
effect from time to time, applied in a manner consistent with that used in preparing the Financial Statements, except as otherwise specifically prescribed herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of determining compliance with any
covenant (including the computation of any financial covenant) contained herein, Indebtedness of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be carried at 100% of the outstanding principal amount thereof, and the effects of FASB ASC 825 on
financial liabilities shall be disregarded.  (b) Changes in GAAP. If at any time any change in GAAP would affect the
computation of any financial ratio or requirement set forth in any Loan Document, and either the Borrower or the Required Lenders shall so request, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Borrower shall negotiate in good faith to amend such
ratio or requirement to preserve the original intent thereof in light of such change in GAAP (subject to the approval of the Required Lenders); provided that, until so amended, (i) such ratio or requirement shall continue to be computed in
accordance with GAAP prior to such change therein and (ii) the Borrower shall provide to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders financial statements and other documents required under this Agreement or as reasonably requested hereunder
setting forth a reconciliation 
  33 



between calculations of such ratio or requirement made before and after giving effect to such change in GAAP.  Section 1.04 Rounding.  Any financial ratios required to be
maintained by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement shall be calculated by dividing the appropriate component by the other component, carrying the result to one place more than the number of places by which such ratio is expressed herein and
rounding the result up or down to the nearest number (with a rounding-up if there is no nearest number).  Section 1.05
Times of Day.  Unless otherwise specified, all references herein to times of day shall be references to Eastern time
(daylight or standard, as applicable).  Section 1.06 Exchange Rates; Currency Equivalents. 
(a) The Administrative Agent or the L/C Issuer, as applicable, shall determine the Spot Rates as of each Revaluation Date to be used for
calculating the Dollar Equivalent of L/C Credit Extensions and Outstanding Amounts denominated in Alternative Currencies. Such Spot Rates shall become effective as of such Revaluation Date and shall be the Spot Rates employed in converting any
amounts between the applicable currencies until the next Revaluation Date to occur. Except for purposes of financial statements delivered hereunder or calculating covenants hereunder or except as otherwise provided herein, the applicable amount of
any currency (other than Dollars) for purposes of the Credit Documents shall be such Dollar Equivalent as so determined by the Administrative Agent or the L/C Issuer, as applicable. 
(b) Wherever in this Agreement in connection with a Revolving Borrowing, conversion, continuation or prepayment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan
or the issuance, amendment or extension of a Letter of Credit, an amount, such as a required minimum or multiple amount, is expressed in Dollars, but such Revolving Borrowing, Eurodollar Rate Loan or Letter of Credit is denominated in an Alternative
Currency, such amount shall be the relevant Alternative Currency Equivalent of such Dollar amount (rounded to the nearest unit of such Alternative Currency, with 0.5 of a unit being rounded upward), as determined by the Administrative Agent or the
L/C Issuer, as the case may be.  Section 1.07 Additional Alternative Currencies. 
(a) The Borrower may from time to time request that Alternative Currency Tranche Revolving Loans be made and/or Alternative Currency
Tranche Letters of Credit be issued in a currency other than those specifically listed in the definition of Alternative Currency; provided that such requested currency is a lawful currency (other than Dollars) that is readily available
and freely transferable and convertible into Dollars. In the case of any such request with respect to the making of Alternative Currency Tranche Revolving Loans, such request shall be subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent and the
Required Alternative Currency Tranche Revolving Lenders; and in the case of any such request with respect to the 
  34 



issuance of Alternative Currency Tranche Letters of Credit, such request shall be subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer. 
(b) Any such request shall be made to the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m., twenty (20) Business Days prior to the
date of the desired Credit Extension (or such other time or date as may be agreed by the Administrative Agent and, in the case of any such request pertaining to Alternative Currency Tranche Letters of Credit, the L/C Issuer, in its or their sole
discretion). In the case of any such request pertaining to Alternative Currency Tranche Revolving Loans, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Alternative Currency Tranche Revolving Lender thereof; and in the case of any such request
pertaining to Alternative Currency Tranche Letters of Credit, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the L/C Issuer thereof. Each Alternative Currency Tranche Revolving Lender (in the case of any such request pertaining to Alternative
Currency Tranche Revolving Loans) or the L/C Issuer (in the case of a request pertaining to Alternative Currency Tranche Letters of Credit) shall notify the Administrative Agent, not later than 11:00 a.m., ten (10) Business Days after
receipt of such request whether it consents, in its sole discretion, to the making of Alternative Currency Tranche Revolving Loans or the issuance of Letters of Credit, as the case may be, in such requested currency and whether it is able to fund in
such requested currency.  (c) Any failure by an Alternative Currency Tranche Revolving Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case
may be, to respond to such request within the time period specified in the preceding sentence shall be deemed to be a refusal by such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, to permit Alternative Currency Tranche Revolving Loans to be made or
Alternative Currency Tranche Letters of Credit to be issued in such requested currency. If the Administrative Agent and the Required Alternative Currency Tranche Revolving Lenders consent to making Alternative Currency Tranche Revolving Loans in
such requested currency, the Administrative Agent shall so notify the Borrower and such currency shall thereupon be deemed for all purposes to be an Alternative Currency hereunder for purposes of any Borrowings of Alternative Currency Tranche
Eurodollar Rate Loans; and if the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer consent to the issuance of Alternative Currency Tranche Letters of Credit in such requested currency, the Administrative Agent shall so notify the Borrower and such currency
shall thereupon be deemed for all purposes to be an Alternative Currency hereunder for purposes of any Alternative Currency Tranche Letter of Credit issuances. In the event that an Alternative Currency Tranche Revolving Lender shall have notified
the Administrative Agent, as provided in Section 1.07(b), that it is not able to fund in the requested currency, such Alternative Currency Tranche Revolving Lender shall have no obligation to make Loans in such requested currency. If the
Administrative Agent shall fail to obtain consent to any request for an additional currency under this Section 1.06, the Administrative Agent shall promptly so notify the Borrower. Any specified currency of an Existing Letter of Credit that is
neither Dollars nor one of the Alternative Currencies specifically listed in the definition of Alternative Currency shall be deemed an Alternative Currency with respect to such Existing Letter of Credit only. 
Section 1.08 Change of Currency.  (a) Each obligation of the Borrower to make a payment denominated in the national currency unit of any Participating Member State of the European Union that adopts the Euro as its lawful currency after
the date hereof shall be redenominated into Euro at the time of 
  35 



such adoption (in accordance with the EMU Legislation). If, in relation to the currency of any such Participating Member State, the basis of accrual of interest expressed in this Agreement in
respect of that currency shall be inconsistent with any convention or practice in the London interbank market for the basis of accrual of interest in respect of the Euro, such expressed basis shall be replaced by such convention or practice with
effect from the date on which such Participating Member State adopts the Euro as its lawful currency; provided that if any Borrowing in the currency of such Participating Member State is outstanding immediately prior to such date, such replacement
shall take effect, with respect to such Borrowing, at the end of the then current Interest Period.  (b) Each provision of this
Agreement shall be subject to such reasonable changes of construction as the Administrative Agent may from time to time specify to be appropriate to reflect the adoption of the Euro by any member state of the European Union and any relevant market
conventions or practices relating to the Euro.  (c) Each provision of this Agreement also shall be subject to such reasonable
changes of construction as the Administrative Agent may from time to time specify to be appropriate to reflect a change in currency of any other country and any relevant market conventions or practices relating to the change in currency. 
Section 1.09 Letter of Credit Amounts.  Unless otherwise specified herein, the amount of a Letter of Credit at any time shall be deemed to be the Dollar Equivalent of the stated amount of such Letter of Credit in effect at such time;
provided, however, that with respect to any Letter of Credit that, by its terms or the terms of any Issuer Document related thereto, provides for one or more automatic increases in the stated amount thereof, the amount of such Letter
of Credit shall be deemed to be the Dollar Equivalent of the maximum stated amount of such Letter of Credit after giving effect to all such increases, whether or not such maximum stated amount is in effect at such time. 
ARTICLE II 
COMMITMENTS AND CREDIT EXTENSIONS  Section 2.01 Loans.  (a) Term Borrowing. Subject to the
terms and conditions set forth herein, each Term Lender severally agrees to make a single loan to the Borrower (each such loan and each loan, if any, made under the Incremental Term Commitments, referred to individually as a Term
Loan and, collectively, the Term Loans), in Dollars, on any Business Day during the Availability Period for the Term Facility, in an aggregate amount equal to such Term Lenders Term Commitment. In addition, in the
event of the establishment of one or more Incremental Term Commitments as provided in Section 2.17, each Incremental Term Lender hereby severally agrees, on the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, to make a single Term Loan
to the Borrower on the effective date of the establishment of each such Incremental Term Commitment, in a principal amount equal to such Incremental Term Lenders (i) increase to its Term Commitment or (ii) Term Commitment, as
applicable. Each Term Borrowing shall consist 
  36 



of Term Loans made simultaneously by the Term Lenders. After giving effect to each Term Loan the Outstanding Amount of all Term Loans shall not exceed the Term Facility as then in effect. Term
Borrowings prepaid or repaid, in whole or in part, may not be reborrowed. Term Loans may be Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar Rate Loans, as further provided herein; provided, however, any Term Borrowing made on the Closing Date or any of
the three (3) Business Days following the Closing Date shall be made as Base Rate Loans unless the Borrower delivers a Funding Indemnity Letter not less than three (3) Business Days prior to the date of such Term Borrowing. 
(b) Revolving Borrowings.  (i) U.S. Tranche Revolving Loans. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, each U.S. Tranche Revolving Lender severally agrees to make loans (each such loan, a U.S. Tranche
Revolving Loan) in Dollars from time to time on any Business Day during the Availability Period with respect to the U.S. Tranche Revolving Commitments, in an aggregate amount not to exceed at any time outstanding the amount of such
Lenders U.S. Tranche Revolving Commitment; provided, however, that after giving effect to any U.S. Tranche Revolving Borrowing, (i) the U.S. Tranche Revolving Exposure of any U.S. Tranche Revolving Lender shall not exceed
such U.S. Tranche Revolving Lenders U.S. Tranche Revolving Commitment, (ii) the aggregate U.S. Tranche Revolving Exposures shall not exceed the total U.S. Tranche Revolving Commitments and (iii) the Total Revolving Outstandings shall
not exceed the Revolving Facility. Within the limits of each U.S. Tranche Revolving Lenders U.S. Tranche Revolving Commitment, and subject to the other terms and conditions hereof, the Borrower may borrow U.S. Tranche Revolving Loans, prepay
under Section 2.05, and reborrow under this Section 2.01(b)(i). U.S. Tranche Revolving Loans may consist of Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar Rate Loans, or a combination thereof, as further provided herein. Notwithstanding the preceding
sentence, any U.S. Tranche Revolving Borrowings made on the Closing Date or any of the three (3) Business Days following the Closing Date shall be made as Base Rate Loans unless the Borrower delivers a Funding Indemnity Letter not less than
three (3) Business Days prior to the date of such U.S. Tranche Revolving Borrowing. U.S. Tranche Revolving Loans may be repaid and reborrowed in accordance with the provisions hereof. 
(ii) Alternative Currency Tranche Revolving Loans. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, each Alternative
Currency Tranche Revolving Lender severally agrees to make loans (each such loan, an Alternative Currency Tranche Revolving Loan) in one or more Alternative Currencies from time to time on any Business Day during the Availability
Period with respect to the Alternative Currency Tranche Revolving Commitments, in an aggregate amount not to exceed at any time outstanding the amount of such Alternative Currency Tranche Revolving Lenders Alternative Currency Tranche
Revolving Commitment; provided, however, that after giving effect to any Alternative Currency Tranche Revolving Borrowing, (i) the Alternative Currency Tranche Revolving Exposure of any Alternative Currency Tranche Revolving
Lender shall not exceed such Alternative Currency Tranche Revolving Lenders Alternative Currency Tranche Revolving Commitment, (ii) the aggregate Alternative Currency Tranche Revolving Exposures shall not exceed the total Alternative
Currency Tranche Revolving Commitments and (iii) the Total Revolving Outstandings shall not exceed the Revolving Facility. Within the limits of each Alternative Currency Tranche Revolving Lenders Alternative Currency Tranche Revolving
Commitment, and subject to the 
  37 



other terms and conditions hereof, the Borrower may borrow Alternative Currency Tranche Revolving Loans, prepay under Section 2.05, and reborrow under this Section 2.01(b)(ii).
Alternative Currency Tranche Revolving Loans must consist of Eurodollar Rate Loans. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, any Alternative Currency Tranche Revolving Borrowings made on the Closing Date or any of the three (3) Business Days
following the Closing Date shall be subject to the receipt by Administrative Agent of a Funding Indemnity Letter from the Borrower not less than three (3) Business Days prior to the date of such Alternative Currency Tranche Revolving Borrowing.
Alternative Currency Tranche Revolving Loans may be repaid and reborrowed in accordance with the provisions hereof.  (c) Bid
Loans Borrowings.  (i) General Terms. At any time commencing on the Closing Date and prior to the Business Day immediately
preceding the Maturity Date with respect to the Revolving Facility, the Borrower may request the Revolving Lenders to make offers to make bid loans to the Borrower (each a Bid Loan); provided that (i) the sum of
all Bid Loans outstanding shall not exceed the Bid Loan Sublimit, (ii) the Total Revolving Outstandings shall not exceed the Revolving Facility, (iii) the aggregate amount of Bid Loans requested for any date and with the same Interest
Period (each a Bid Loan Borrowing) shall be at least $2,000,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof; and (iv) all Interest Periods applicable to Bid Loans shall be subject to and shall comply with the
definition of Interest Period. The Revolving Lenders may, but shall have no obligation to, make such offers, and the Borrower may, but shall have no obligation to, accept any such offers in the manner set forth in this
Section 2.01(c). In no event shall Bid Loans be made to the Borrower unless, at the time such Loans are made, two of the three ratings from S&P, Moodys or Fitch are BBB-or better (Baa3 in the case of Moodys). 
(ii) Bid Loan Procedures.  (A) When the Borrower wishes to request offers to make Bid Loans, it shall provide telephonic or electronic notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly notify the Revolving Lenders) followed
promptly by written notice substantially in the form of Exhibit E-1 (each, a Bid Loan Quote Request) duly completed and executed by a duly authorized executive officer of the Borrower, so as to be received no later than
10:00 a.m. on the second Business Day before the proposed funding date (or such other time and date as the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, with the consent of the Required Lenders, may agree). Subject to the definition of Interest
Period, the Borrower may request offers for up to three different Bid Loan Borrowings in a single Bid Loan Quote Request, in which case such Bid Loan Quote Request shall be deemed a separate Bid Loan Quote Request for each such borrowing.
Except as otherwise provided in this Section 2.01(c), no Bid Loan Quote Request shall be given within five Business Days (or such other number of days as the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, with the consent of the Required Lenders, may
agree) of any other Bid Loan Quote Request.  (B) Each Revolving Lender may, but shall not be obligated to, in response to any
Bid Loan Quote Request submit one or more written quotes substantially in the form of Exhibit E-2 (each a Bid Loan Quote), duly completed, each containing an offer to

  38 



make a Bid Loan for the Interest Period requested and setting forth the Absolute Rate to be applicable to such Bid Loan; provided that (1) a Revolving Lender may make a single
submission containing one or more Bid Loan Quotes in response to several Bid Loan Quote Requests given at the same time; and (2) the principal amount of the Bid Loan for which each such offer is being made shall be at least $2,000,000 and
multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof; provided that the aggregate principal amount of all Bid Loans for which a Revolving Lender submits Bid Loan Quotes (x) may be greater or less than the Revolving Credit Commitment of such
Revolving Lender but (y) may not exceed the principal amount of the Bid Loan Borrowing for which offers were requested. Each Bid Loan Quote by a Revolving Lender other than the Person serving as the Administrative Agent must be submitted to the
Administrative Agent by fax not later than 8:00 a.m. on the funding date (or such other time and date as the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, with the consent of the Required Lenders, may agree); provided that any Bid Loan Quote
may be submitted by the Person serving as the Administrative Agent, in its capacity as a Revolving Lender, only if the Person serving as the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower of the terms of the offer contained therein not later than 7:45
a.m. on the funding date. Subject to Articles IV and VIII, any Bid Loan Quote so made shall be irrevocable except with the consent of the Administrative Agent given on the instructions of the Borrower. Unless otherwise agreed by the Administrative
Agent and the Borrower, no Bid Loan Quote shall contain qualifying, conditional or similar language or propose terms other than or in addition to those set forth in the applicable Bid Loan Quote Request and, in particular, no Bid Loan Quote may be
conditioned upon acceptance by the Borrower of all (or some specified minimum) of the principal amount of the Bid Loan for which such Bid Loan Quote is being made.  (C) The Administrative Agent shall, as promptly as practicable after any Bid Loan Quote is submitted (but in any event not later than 8:30 a.m. on the funding date, or 7:45 a.m. on the Funding Date with
respect to any Bid Loan Quote submitted by the Person serving as the Administrative Agent, in its capacity as a Revolving Lender), notify the Borrower of the terms (1) of any Bid Loan Quote submitted by a Revolving Lender that is in accordance
with Section 2.01(c)(ii)(B) and (2) of any Bid Loan Quote that amends, modifies or is otherwise inconsistent with a previous Bid Loan Quote submitted by such Revolving Lender with respect to the same Bid Loan Quote Request. Any subsequent
Bid Loan Quote shall be disregarded by the Administrative Agent unless the subsequent Bid Loan Quote is submitted solely to correct a manifest error in a former Bid Loan Quote. The Administrative Agents notice to the Borrower shall specify
(x) the aggregate principal amount of the Bid Loan Borrowing for which Bid Loan Quotes have been received and (y) (I) the respective principal amounts and (II) the rates of interest (which shall be expressed as an absolute number and
not in terms of a specified margin over the quoting Revolving Lenders cost of funds) (the Absolute Rate) so offered by each Revolving Lender (identifying the Revolving Lender that made each such Bid Loan Quote). 
(D) Not later than 9:00 a.m. on the funding date (or such other time and date as the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, with the
consent of each Revolving Lender that has submitted a Bid Loan Quote may agree), the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of its acceptance or nonacceptance of the Bid Loan Quotes so notified to it pursuant to Section 2.01(c)(ii)(C)
(and the failure of the Borrower to give such notice by such time shall constitute nonacceptance), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each 
  39 



affected Revolving Lender. In the case of acceptance, such notice shall specify the aggregate principal amount of offers for each Interest Period that are accepted. The Borrower may accept any
Bid Loan Quote in whole or in part; provided that (1) any Bid Loan Quote accepted in part shall be at least $1,000,000 and multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof; (2) the aggregate principal amount of each Bid Loan
Borrowing may not exceed the applicable amount set forth in the related Bid Loan Quote Request; (3) the aggregate principal amount of each Bid Loan Borrowing shall be at least $2,000,000 and multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and shall
not cause the limits specified in Section 2.01(c) to be violated; (4) acceptance of offers may be made only in ascending order of Absolute Rates, beginning with the lowest rate so offered; and (5) the Borrower may not accept any offer
where the Administrative Agent has advised the Borrower that such offer fails to comply with Section 2.01(c)(ii) or otherwise fails to comply with the requirements of this Agreement (including Section 2.01(a)). If offers are made by two or
more Revolving Lenders with the same Absolute Rates for a greater aggregate principal amount than the amount in respect of which offers are permitted to be accepted for the related Interest Period, the principal amount of Bid Loans in respect of
which such offers are accepted shall be allocated by the Borrower among such Revolving Lenders as nearly as possible (in amounts of at least $1,000,000 and multiples of $500,000 in excess thereof) in proportion to the aggregate principal amount of
such offers. Determinations by the Borrower of the amounts of Bid Loans shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. Notwithstanding anything else contained herein, the Borrower shall have no obligation to accept any Bid Loan Quote by a
Defaulting Lender.  (E) Subject to the terms set forth in this Agreement, any Revolving Lender whose offer to make any Bid
Loan has been accepted shall, prior to 10:00 a.m. on the date specified for the making of such Loan, make the amount of such Loan available to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds, for the account of the Borrower. The amount so
received by the Administrative Agent shall, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, be made available to the Borrower on or before 11:00 a.m. on such date by depositing the same, in immediately available funds, in an account of the
Borrower designated by the Borrower and maintained with the Administrative Agent.  Section 2.02 Borrowings,
Conversions and Continuations of Loans.  (a) Notice of Borrowing. Each Borrowing, each conversion of Loans from
one Type to the other, and each continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be made upon the Borrowers irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent, which may be given by telephone. Each such notice (i) with respect to amounts
denominated Dollars, must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. (x) with respect to Eurodollar Rate Loans, three (3) Business Days prior to and (y) with respect to Base Rate Loans, on the requested date of
any Borrowing, conversion or continuation and (ii) with respect to Eurodollar Rate Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency, must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. (London time), four (4) Business Days
prior to the requested date of any Borrowing, conversion or continuation. Each telephonic notice by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.02(a) must be confirmed promptly by delivery to the Administrative Agent of a written Loan Notice,
appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer. Except as provided in Sections 2.03(c) and 2.04(d), each Borrowing, conversion or continuation of Revolving Loans shall be in a principal amount of (i) with respect to Revolving Loans
that are or are to be 
  40 



Eurodollar Rate Loans (A) denominated in Dollars, $3,000,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof, (B) denominated in an Alternative Currency, an amount in such Alternative
Currency having a Dollar Equivalent of approximately $3,000,000 or such amount plus an amount in such Alternative Currency having a Dollar Equivalent of a whole multiple of approximately $100,000 in excess thereof or (ii) with respect to
Revolving Loans that are or are to be Base Rate Loans, $1,000,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof. Each Borrowing and each conversion or continuation of Term Loans shall be in an amount equal to the principal amount of the Term
Commitments. Each Loan Not

be made as, or converted to, Base Rate Loans. If the Borrower fails to specify a currency in a Loan Notice requesting a Revolving Borrowing,
then the Revolving Loans so requested shall be made in Dollars. Any such automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans shall be effective as of the last day of the Interest Period then in effect with respect to the applicable Eurodollar Rate Loans. If the
Borrower requests a Borrowing of, conversion to, or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans in any such Loan Notice, but fails to specify an Interest Period, the Loan Notice will be deemed to have specified an Interest Period of one (1) month. No
Alternative Currency Tranche Revolving Loan may be converted into or continued as an Alternative Currency Tranche Revolving Loan denominated in a different currency, but instead must be prepaid in the original currency of such Alternative Currency
Tranche Revolving Loan and reborrowed in the other currency. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (x) a Swingline Loan may not be converted to a Eurodollar Rate Loan and (y) Bid Loans may not be continued or converted.
 (b) Advances. Following receipt of a Loan Notice for a Facility, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each
Appropriate Lender of the amount of its Applicable Percentage under such Facility of the applicable Loans, and if no timely notice of a conversion or continuation is provided by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Appropriate
Lender of the details of any automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans or continuation of Revolving Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency, in each case as described in Section 2.02(a). In the case of a Borrowing denominated in Dollars,
each Appropriate Lender shall make the amount of its Loan available to the Administrative Agent in Dollars in immediately available funds at the Administrative Agents Office not later than 1:00 p.m. on the Business Day specified in the
applicable Loan Notice. In the case of a Borrowing denominated in an Alternative Currency, each Alternative Currency Tranche Revolving Lender shall make the amount of its Loan available to the Administrative Agent in the applicable Alternative
Currency in Same Day Funds at the Administrative Agents Office not later than the Applicable Time specified by the Administrative Agent on the Business Day specified in the applicable Loan Notice. Upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions
set forth in Section 4.02 
  41 



(and, if such Borrowing is an initial Credit Extension, Section 4.01), the Administrative Agent shall make all funds so received available to the Borrower in like funds as received by the
Administrative Agent either by (i) crediting the account of the Borrower on the books of the Administrative Agent with the amount of such funds or (ii) wire transfer of such funds, in each case in accordance with instructions provided to
(and reasonably acceptable to) the Administrative Agent by the Borrower; provided, however, that if, on the date a Loan Notice with respect to a Revolving Borrowing is given by the Borrower, there are L/C Borrowings outstanding, then the proceeds of
such Revolving Borrowing, first, shall be applied to the payment in full of any such L/C Borrowings, and second, shall be made available to the Borrower as provided above.  (c) Eurodollar Rate Loans. Except as otherwise provided herein, a Eurodollar Rate Loan may be continued or converted only on the last day of an Interest Period for such Eurodollar Rate Loan. During
the existence of a Default, no Loans may be requested as, converted to or continued as Eurodollar Rate Loans without the consent of the Required Lenders, and the Required Lenders may demand that any or all of the outstanding Eurodollar Rate Loans
(other than Eurodollar Rate Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency) be converted immediately to Base Rate Loans. The Required Alternative Currency Tranche Revolving Lenders may demand that any or all of the then outstanding Eurodollar Rate
Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency be prepaid, or redenominated into Dollars in the amount of the Dollar Equivalent thereof, on the last day of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto. 
(d) Notice of Interest Rates. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the interest rate
applicable to any Interest Period for Eurodollar Rate Loans upon determination of such interest rate. At any time that Base Rate Loans are outstanding, the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders of any change in KeyBank
National Associations prime rate used in determining the Base Rate promptly following the public announcement of such change.  (e) Interest Periods. After giving effect to all Term Borrowings, all conversions of Term Loans from one Type to the other, and all continuations of Term Loans as the same Type, there shall not be
more than one Interest Period in effect in respect of the Term Facility. After giving effect to all Revolving Borrowings and Bid Loan Borrowings, all conversions of Revolving Loans from one Type to the other, and all continuations of Revolving Loans
as the same Type, there shall not be more than ten Interest Periods in effect in respect of the Revolving Loans and Bid Loans. 
Section 2.03 Letters of Credit.  (a) The Letter of Credit Commitment.  (i) Subject to the terms and
conditions set forth herein, (A) the L/C Issuer agrees, in reliance upon the agreements of the Revolving Lenders set forth in this Section, (1) from time to time on any Business Day during the period from the Closing Date until the Letter
of Credit Expiration Date, to issue U.S. Tranche Letters of Credit (denominated in Dollars) or Alternative Currency Tranche Letters of Credit (in one or more Alternative Currencies) for the account of the Borrower (which may be in support of
obligations of the

Borrower or in support of obligations of a Subsidiary), and to amend Letters of Credit previously issued by it, in accordance with Section 2.03(b) and (2) to honor drawings under the
Letters of Credit; and (B) the U.S. Tranche Revolving Lenders severally agree to participate in U.S. Tranche Letters of Credit and the Alternative Currency Tranche Revolving Lenders severally agree to participate in Alternative Currency Tranche
Letters of Credit, in each case issued for the account of the Borrower (which may be in support of obligations of the Borrower or in support of obligations of a Subsidiary) and any drawings thereunder; provided that after giving effect to any L/C
Credit Extension with respect to any Letter of Credit, (A) the Total Revolving Outstandings shall not exceed the Revolving Facility, (B) the Revolving Exposure of any Revolving Lender shall not exceed such Lenders Revolving
Commitment, (C) the U.S. Tranche Revolving Exposure of any U.S. Tranche Revolving Lender shall not exceed such Lenders U.S. Tranche Revolving Commitment, (D) the Alternative Currency Tranche Revolving Exposure of any Alternative
Currency Tranche Revolving Lender shall not exceed such Lenders Alternative Currency Tranche Revolving Commitment and (E) the Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations shall not exceed the Letter of Credit Sublimit. Each request by the
Borrower for the issuance or amendment of a Letter of Credit shall be deemed to be a representation by the Borrower that the L/C Credit Extension so requested complies with the conditions set forth in the proviso to the preceding sentence. Within
the foregoing limits, and subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Borrowers ability to obtain Letters of Credit shall be fully revolving, and accordingly the Borrower may, during the foregoing period, obtain Letters of Credit to
replace Letters of Credit that have expired or that have been drawn upon and reimbursed. All Existing Letters of Credit shall be deemed to have been issued pursuant hereto, and from and after the Closing Date shall be subject to and governed by the
terms and conditions hereof.  (ii) The L/C Issuer shall not issue any Letter of Credit if: 
(A) the expiry date of such Letter of Credit would occur more than twelve (12) months after the date of issuance, unless the
Required Lenders have approved such expiry date; or  (B) the expiry date of such Letter of Credit would occur after the Letter
of Credit Expiration Date, except that a Letter of Credit may expire up to one year beyond the Maturity Date of the Revolving Facility so long as the Borrower Cash Collateralizes (as provided in Section 2.14) the L/C Obligations with respect to
such Letter of Credit no later than 30 days prior to the Letter of Credit Expiration Date).  (iii) The L/C Issuer shall not
be under any obligation to issue any Letter of Credit if:  (A) any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or
arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain the L/C Issuer from issuing such Letter of Credit, or any Law applicable to the L/C Issuer or any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental
Authority with jurisdiction over the L/C Issuer shall prohibit, or request that the L/C Issuer refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit generally or such Letter of Credit in particular or shall impose upon the L/C Issuer with respect to such
Letter of Credit any restriction, reserve or capital requirement (for which the L/C Issuer is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the Closing Date, or shall impose 
  43 



upon the L/C Issuer any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not applicable on the Closing Date and which the L/C Issuer in good faith deems material to it; 
(B) the issuance of such Letter of Credit would violate one or more policies of the L/C Issuer applicable to letters of credit generally;
 (C) except as otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer, such Letter of Credit is in an initial stated
amount less than $50,000;  (D) such Letter of Credit is to be denominated in a currency other than an Approved Currency;
 (E) any Revolving Lender is at that time a Defaulting Lender, unless the L/C Issuer has entered into arrangements, including
the delivery of Cash Collateral, satisfactory to the L/C Issuer (in its sole discretion) with the Borrower or such Revolving Lender to eliminate the L/C Issuers actual or potential Fronting Exposure (after giving effect to
Section 2.15(a)(iv)) with respect to such Defaulting Lender arising from either such Letter of Credit or such Letter of Credit and all other L/C Obligations as to which the L/C Issuer has actual or potential Fronting Exposure, as it may elect
in its sole discretion;  (F) the L/C Issuer does not as of the issuance date of such Letter of Credit issue letters of credit
in the requested currency; or  (G) the Letter of Credit contains any provisions for automatic reinstatement of the stated
amount after any drawing thereunder.  (iv) The L/C Issuer shall not amend any Letter of Credit if the L/C Issuer would not be
permitted at such time to issue the Letter of Credit in its amended form under the terms hereof.  (v) The L/C Issuer shall be
under no obligation to amend any Letter of Credit if (A) the L/C Issuer would have no obligation at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its amended form under the terms hereof, or (B) the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit does
not accept the proposed amendment to the Letter of Credit.  (vi) The L/C Issuer shall act on behalf of the Revolving Lenders
with respect to any Letters of Credit issued by it and the documents associated therewith, and the L/C Issuer shall have all of the benefits and immunities (A) provided to the Administrative Agent in Article IX with respect to any acts taken or
omissions suffered by the L/C Issuer in connection with Letters of Credit issued by it or proposed to be issued by it and Issuer Documents pertaining to such Letters of Credit as fully as if the term Administrative Agent as used in
Article IX included the L/C Issuer with respect to such acts or omissions and (B) as additionally provided herein with respect to the L/C Issuer.  (b) Procedures for Issuance and Amendment of Letters of Credit.  (i) Each Letter
of Credit shall be issued or amended, as the case may be, upon the request of the Borrower delivered to the L/C Issuer (with a copy to the 
  44 



Administrative Agent) in the form of a Letter of Credit Application, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer. Such Letter of Credit Application may be sent by fax
transmission, by United States mail, by overnight courier, by electronic transmission using the system provided by the L/C Issuer, by personal delivery or by any other means acceptable to the L/C Issuer. Such Letter of Credit Application must be
received by the L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. at least two (2) Business Days (or such later date and time as the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer may agree in a particular instance in their sole
discretion) prior to the proposed issuance date or date of amendment, as the case may be. In the case of a request for an initial issuance of a Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Application shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to the
L/C Issuer: (A) the proposed issuance date of the requested Letter of Credit (which shall be a Business Day); (B) the amount thereof and the Approved Currency thereof; (C) the expiry date thereof; (D) the name and address of the
beneficiary thereof; (E) the documents to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; (F) the full text of any certificate to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; (G) the purpose
and nature of the requested Letter of Credit; and (H) such other matters as the L/C Issuer may require. In the case of a request for an amendment of any outstanding Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Application shall specify in form and
detail satisfactory to the L/C Issuer (1) the Letter of Credit to be amended; (2) the proposed date of amendment thereof (which shall be a Business Day); (3) the nature of the proposed amendment; and (4) such other matters as the
L/C Issuer may reasonably require. Additionally, the Borrower shall furnish to the L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent such other documents and information pertaining to such requested Letter of Credit issuance or amendment, including any Issuer
Documents, as the L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent may reasonably require.  (ii) Promptly after receipt of any Letter of
Credit Application, the L/C Issuer will confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the Administrative Agent has received a copy of such Letter of Credit Application from the Borrower and, if not, the L/C Issuer will
provide the Administrative Agent with a copy thereof. Unless the L/C Issuer has received written notice from any Revolving Lender, the Administrative Agent or the Borrower, at least one (1) Business Day prior to the requested date of issuance
or amendment of the applicable Letter of Credit, that one or more applicable conditions contained in Article IV shall not then be satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the L/C Issuer shall, on the requested date, issue a
Letter of Credit for the account of the Borrower (which may be in support of obligations of the Borrower or in support of obligations of a Subsidiary) or enter into the applicable amendment, as the case may be, in each case in accordance with the
L/C Issuers usual and customary business practices. Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each Revolving Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the L/C Issuer a risk
participation in such Letter of Credit in an amount equal to the product of such Revolving Lenders Applicable Revolving Percentage times the amount of such Letter of Credit. 
(iii) Promptly after its delivery of any Letter of Credit or any amendment to a Letter of Credit to an advising bank with respect thereto
or to the beneficiary thereof, the L/C Issuer will also deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent a true and complete copy of such Letter of Credit or amendment. 
  45 


(c) Drawings and Reimbursements; Funding of Participations. 
(i) Upon any drawing under any Letter of Credit, the L/C Issuer shall notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent thereof. In the
case of a U.S. Tranche Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall reimburse the L/C Issuer through the Administrative Agent in Dollars. In the case of an Alternative Currency Tranche Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall reimburse the L/C Issuer through
the Administrative Agent in such Alternative Currency, unless (A) the L/C Issuer (at its option) shall have specified in such notice that it will require reimbursement in Dollars, or (B) in the absence of any such requirement for
reimbursement in Dollars, the Borrower shall have notified the L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent promptly following receipt of the notice of drawing that the Borrower will reimburse the L/C Issuer in Dollars. In the case of any such
reimbursement in Dollars of a drawing under an Alternative Currency Tranche Letter of Credit, the L/C Issuer shall notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of the Dollar Equivalent of the amount of such drawing promptly following the
determination thereof. Not later than (x) 11:00 a.m. on the date of any payment by the L/C Issuer under a U.S. Tranche Letter of Credit to be reimbursed in Dollars and (y) the Applicable Time on the date of any payment by the L/C Issuer
under an Alternative Currency Tranche Letter of Credit to be reimbursed in an Alternative Currency (each such date, an Honor Date), the Borrower shall reimburse the L/C Issuer through the Administrative Agent in Dollars or in the
applicable Alternative Currency, as the case may be. If the Borrower fails to so reimburse the L/C Issuer by such time, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each applicable Revolving Lender of the Honor Date, the amount of the unreimbursed
drawing (in the Approved Currency in which such Letter of Credit was issued) (the Unreimbursed Amount), and the amount of such Revolving Lenders Applicable Revolving Percentage thereof. In such event, in the case of
(i) a U.S. Tranche Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a U.S. Tranche Revolving Borrowing of Base Rate Loans to be disbursed on the Honor Date in an amount equal to the Unreimbursed Amount, without regard to the
minimum and multiples specified in Section 2.02 for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans, but subject to the amount of the unutilized portion of the U.S. Tranche Revolving Commitments and the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (other
than the delivery of a Loan Notice) and (ii) an Alternative Currency Tranche Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall be deemed to have requested an Alternative Currency Tranche Revolving Borrowing of Eurodollar Rate Loans to be disbursed on the
Honor Date in an amount equal to the Unreimbursed Amount, without regard to the minimum and multiples specified in Section 2.02 for the principal amount of Eurodollar Rate Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency, but subject to the amount
of the unutilized portion of the Alternative Currency Tranche Revolving Commitment and the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (other than the delivery of a Loan Notice). Any notice given by the L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent pursuant
to this Section 2.03(c)(i) may be given by telephone if immediately confirmed in writing; provided that the lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice. 
(ii) Each Revolving Lender shall upon any notice pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(i) make funds available for the account of the L/C
Issuer, in the Approved Currency in which the applicable Letter of Credit was issued, at the Administrative Agents Office in an amount equal to its Applicable Revolving Percentage of the Unreimbursed Amount not later than 1:00 p.m. on the
Business Day specified in such notice by the Administrative Agent, whereupon, subject to the provisions of Section 2.03(c)(iii), each Revolving Lender that so makes funds 
  46 



available shall be deemed to have made a U.S. Tranche Revolving Loan or an Alternative Currency Tranche Revolving Loan, as applicable, to the Borrower in such amount. The Administrative Agent
shall remit the funds so received to the L/C Issuer in the applicable Approved Currency.  (iii) With respect to any
Unreimbursed Amount that is not fully refinanced by a Revolving Borrowing because the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 cannot be satisfied or for any other reason, the Borrower shall be deemed to have incurred from the L/C Issuer an L/C
Borrowing in the amount of the Unreimbursed Amount that is not so refinanced, which L/C Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the Default Rate. In such event, each Revolving Lenders
payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(ii) shall be deemed payment in respect of its participation in such L/C Borrowing and shall constitute an L/C Advance from such Lender in
satisfaction of its participation obligation under this Section.  (iv) Until each Revolving Lender funds its Revolving Loan or
L/C Advance pursuant to this Section 2.03(c) to reimburse the L/C Issuer for any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of such Lenders Applicable Revolving Percentage of such amount shall be solely for the account
of the L/C Issuer.  (v) Each Revolving Lenders obligation to make Revolving Loans or L/C Advances to reimburse the L/C
Issuer for amounts drawn under Letters of Credit, as contemplated by this Section 2.03(c), shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or
other right which such Lender may have against the L/C Issuer, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default; or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not
similar to any of the foregoing; provided, however, that each Revolving Lenders obligation to make Revolving Loans pursuant to this Section 2.03(c) is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (other than delivery by
the Borrower of a Loan Notice). No such making of an L/C Advance shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrower to reimburse the L/C Issuer for the amount of any payment made by the L/C Issuer under any Letter of Credit, together
with interest as provided herein.  (vi) If any Revolving Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the
account of the L/C Issuer any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.03(c) by the time specified in Section 2.03(c)(ii), then, without limiting the other provisions of this
Agreement, the L/C Issuer shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment
is immediately available to the L/C Issuer at a rate per annum equal to the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the L/C Issuer in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative,
processing or similar fees customarily charged by the L/C Issuer in connection with the foregoing. If such Lender pays such amount (with interest and fees as aforesaid), the amount so paid shall constitute such Lenders Revolving Loan included
in the relevant Revolving Borrowing or L/C Advance in respect of the relevant L/C Borrowing, as the case may be, as of the date of such Revolving Borrowing or L/C Borrowing. A certificate of the L/C Issuer

  47 



submitted to any Revolving Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this Section 2.03(c)(vi) shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
(d) Repayment of Participations.  (i) At any time after the L/C Issuer has made a payment under any Letter of Credit and has received from any Revolving Lender such Lenders L/C Advance in respect of such payment in accordance with
Section 2.03(c), if the Administrative Agent receives for the account of the L/C Issuer any payment in respect of the related Unreimbursed Amount or interest thereon (whether directly from the Borrower or otherwise, including proceeds of Cash
Collateral applied thereto by the Administrative Agent), the Administrative Agent will distribute to such Lender its Applicable Revolving Percentage thereof in the same funds as those received by the Administrative Agent. 
(ii) If any payment received by the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer and distributed to the Revolving Lenders
pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(i) is required to be returned under any of the circumstances described in Section 10.05 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the L/C Issuer in its discretion), each Revolving Lender shall pay to
the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer its Applicable Revolving Percentage thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned by such Lender, at a
rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect. The obligations of the Lenders under this clause shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement. 
(e) Obligations Absolute. The obligation of the Borrower to reimburse the L/C Issuer for each drawing under each Letter of Credit
and to repay each L/C Borrowing and each Revolving Credit Loan made pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(ii) shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all
circumstances, including the following:  (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of such Letter of Credit, this Agreement,
or any other Loan Document;  (ii) the existence of any claim, counterclaim, setoff, defense or other right that the Borrower
or any Subsidiary may have at any time against any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), the L/C Issuer or any other Person, whether in connection
with this Agreement, the

ding any arising in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law; 
(viii) any adverse change in the relevant exchange rates or in the availability of the relevant Alternative Currency to the Borrower or
any Subsidiary or in the relevant currency markets generally; or  (ix) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether
or not similar to any of the foregoing, including any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries. 
The Borrower shall promptly examine a copy of each Letter of Credit and each amendment thereto that is delivered to it and, in the event
of any claim of noncompliance with the Borrowers instructions or other irregularity, the Borrower will immediately notify the L/C Issuer. The Borrower shall be conclusively deemed to have waived any such claim against the L/C Issuer and its
correspondents unless such notice is given as aforesaid.  (f) Role of L/C Issuer. Each Lender and the Borrower agree
that, in paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit, the L/C Issuer shall not have any responsibility to obtain any document (other than any sight draft, certificates and documents expressly required by such Letter of Credit) or to ascertain or
inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such document or the authority of the Person executing or delivering any such document. None of the L/C Issuer, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties or any correspondent,
participant or assignee of the L/C Issuer shall be liable to any Lender for (i) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the approval of the Revolving Lenders or the Required Lenders, as applicable;
(ii) any action taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (iii) the due execution, effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any document or instrument related to any Letter of Credit or Issuer
Document. The Borrower hereby assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit; provided, however, that this assumption is not

  49 



intended to, and shall not, preclude the Borrowers pursuing such rights and remedies as it may have against such beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other agreement. None of the
L/C Issuer, the Administrative Agent, any Lender, any of their respective Related Parties or any correspondent, participant or assignee of the L/C Issuer shall be liable or responsible for any of the matters described in Section 2.03(e);
provided, however, that anything in such clauses to the contrary notwithstanding, the Borrower may have a claim against the L/C Issuer, and the L/C Issuer may be liable to the Borrower, to the extent, but only to the extent, of any
direct, as opposed to consequential or exemplary, damages suffered by the Borrower, as determined by a final nonappealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, were caused by the L/C Issuers willful misconduct or gross negligence or
the L/C Issuers willful failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the beneficiary of a sight draft and certificate(s) strictly complying with the terms and conditions of a Letter of Credit (other than as a
result of an order of a court of competent jurisdiction). In furtherance and not in limitation 

of Credit and (ii) the rules of the UCP shall apply to each commercial
Letter of Credit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the L/C Issuer shall not be responsible to the Borrower for, and the L/C Issuers rights and remedies against the Borrower shall not be impaired by, any action or inaction of the L/C Issuer
required or permitted under any law, order, or practice that is required or permitted to be applied to any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, including the Law or any order of a jurisdiction where the L/C Issuer or the beneficiary is located, the
practice stated in the ISP or UCP, as applicable, or in the decisions, opinions, practice statements, or official commentary of the ICC Banking Commission, the Bankers Association for Finance and TradeInternational Financial Services
Association (BAFT-IFSA), or the Institute of International Banking Law & Practice, whether or not any Letter of Credit chooses such law or practice.  (h) Letter of Credit Fees. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Lender in accordance, subject to Section 2.15, with its Applicable Revolving
Percentage a Letter of Credit fee (the Letter of Credit Fee) for each Letter of Credit equal to the Applicable Rate times the daily amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. For purposes of computing the daily
amount available to be drawn under any Letter of Credit, the amount of such Letter of Credit shall be determined in accordance with Section 1.06. Letter of Credit Fees shall be (A) due and payable on the last Business Day of each March,
June, September and December, commencing with the first such date to occur after the issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the Letter of Credit Expiration Date and thereafter on 
  50 



demand and (B) computed on a quarterly basis in arrears. If there is any change in the Applicable Rate during any quarter, the daily amount available to be drawn under each Letter of Credit
shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Rate separately for each period dur

endment and other processing fees, and other standard costs and charges, of the L/C Issuer relating to letters of credit as from time to time in effect. Such customary fees and standard costs
and charges are due and payable on demand and are nonrefundable.  (j) Conflict with Issuer Documents. In the event of
any conflict between the terms hereof and the terms of any Issuer Document, the terms hereof shall control.  (k) Letters of
Credit Issued for Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding that a Letter of Credit issued or outstanding hereunder is in support of any obligations of, or is for the account of, a Subsidiary, the Borrower shall be obligated to reimburse the L/C Issuer
hereunder for any and all drawings under such Letter of Credit. The Borrower hereby acknowledges that the issuance of Letters of Credit for the account of Subsidiaries inures to the benefit of the Borrower, and that the Borrowers business
derives substantial benefits from the businesses of such Subsidiaries.  Section 2.04 Swingline Loans.
 (a) The Swingline. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Swingline Lender, in reliance upon the
agreements of the other Lenders set forth in this Section, may in its sole discretion make loans in Dollars (each such loan, a Swingline Loan). Each Swingline Loan may be made, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein,
to the Borrower, in Dollars, from time to time on any Business Day during the Availability Period in an aggregate amount not to exceed at any time outstanding the Swingline Sublimit, notwithstanding the fact that such Swingline Loans, when
aggregated with the Applicable Revolving Percentage of the Outstanding Amount of Revolving Loans, Bid Loans and L/C Obligations of the Lender acting as Swingline Lender, may exceed the amount of such Lenders Revolving Commitment;
provided, however, that (i) after giving effect to any Swingline Loan, (A) the Total Revolving Outstandings shall not exceed the Revolving Facility at such time and (B) the Revolving Exposure of any Revolving Lender at
such time shall not exceed such Lenders Revolving Commitment, (ii) the Borrower shall not use the proceeds of any Swingline Loan to refinance any outstanding Swingline Loan and (iii) the Swingline Lender shall not be under any
obligation to make any Swingline Loan if it shall determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that it has, or by such Credit Extension may have, Fronting Exposure. Within the foregoing limits, and subject to
the other terms and conditions hereof, the 
  51 



Borrower may borrow under this Section, prepay under Section 2.05, and reborrow under this Section. Each Swingline Loan shall bear interest as provided in Section 2.08(a)(iv).
Immediately upon the making of a Swingline Loan, each Revolving Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the Swingline Lender a risk participation in such Swingline Loan in an amount equal to the
product of such Revolving Lenders Applicable Revolving Percentage times the amount of such Swingline Loan.  (b)
Borrowing Procedures. Each Swingline Borrowing shall be made upon the Borrowers irrevocable notice to the Swingline Lender and the Administrative Agent, which may be given by telephone. Each such notice must be received by the Swingline
Lender and the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. on the requested borrowing date, and shall specify (i) the amount to be borrowed, which shall be a minimum of $1,000,000 and if in excess thereof, in integral multiples of
$1,000,000, or, if less, the unused portion of the Swing Line Sublimit and (ii) the requested date of such Swingline Borrowing (which shall be a Business Day). Each such telephonic notice must be confirmed promptly by delivery to the Swingline
Lender and the Administrative Agent of a written Swingline Loan Notice, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer. Promptly after receipt by the Swingline Lender of any telephonic Swingline Loan Notice, the Swingline Lender will
confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the Administrative Agent has also received such Swingline Loan Notice and, if not, the Swingline Lender will notify the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) of the
contents thereof. Unless the Swingline Lender has received notice (by telephone or in writing) from the Administrative Agent (including at the request of any Revolving Lender) prior to 2:00 p.m. on the date of the proposed Swingline Borrowing
(A) directing the Swingline Lender not to make such Swingline Loan as a result of the limitations set forth in the first proviso to the first sentence of Section 2.04(a), or (B) that one or more of the applicable conditions specified
in Article IV is not then satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Swingline Lender will, not later than 3:00 p.m. on the borrowing date specified in such Swingline Loan Notice, make the amount of its Swingline Loan available
to the Borrower.  (c) Refinancing of Swingline Loans. 
(i) The Swingline Lender at any time in its sole discretion may request, on behalf of the Borrower (which hereby irrevocably authorizes
the Swingline Lender to so request on its behalf), that each Revolving Lender make a Base Rate Loan in an amount equal to such Lenders Applicable Revolving Percentage of the amount of Swingline Loans then outstanding. Such request shall be
made in writing (which written request shall be deemed to be a Loan Notice for purposes hereof) and in accordance with the requirements of Section 2.02, without regard to the minimum and multiples specified therein for the principal amount of
Base Rate Loans, but subject to the unutilized portion of the Revolving Facility and the conditions set forth in Section 4.02. The Swingline Lender shall furnish the Borrower with a copy of the applicable Loan Notice promptly after delivering
such Loan Notice to the Administrative Agent. Each Revolving Lender shall make an amount equal to its Applicable Revolving Percentage of the amount specified in such Loan Notice available to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds
for the account of the Swingline Lender at the Administrative Agents Office for Dollar-denominated payments not later than 1:00 p.m. on the day specified in such Loan Notice, whereupon, subject to Section 2.04(c)(ii), each Revolving
Lender that so makes funds available 
  52 



shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Loan to the Borrower in such amount. The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the Swingline Lender. 
(ii) If for any reason any Swingline Loan cannot be refinanced by such a Revolving Borrowing in accordance with Section 2.04(c)(i),
the request for Base Rate Loans submitted by the Swingline Lender as set forth herein shall be deemed to be a request by the Swingline Lender that each of the Revolving Lenders fund its risk participation in the relevant Swingline Loan and each
Revolving Lenders payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swingline Lender pursuant to Section 2.04(c)(i) shall be deemed payment in respect of such participation. 
(iii) If any Revolving Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swingline Lender any amount
required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.04(c) by the time specified in Section 2.04(c)(i), the Swingline Lender shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the
Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the Swingline Lender at a rate per annum equal to the greater of
the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Swingline Lender in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Swingline Lender in connection
with the foregoing. If such Lender pays such amount (with interest and fees as aforesaid), the amount so paid shall constitute such Lenders Revolving Loan included in the relevant Revolving Borrowing or funded participation in the relevant
Swingline Loan, as the case may be, as of the date of such Revolving Borrowing or funded participation. A certificate of the Swingline Lender submitted to any Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this
clause (iii) shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  (iv) Each Revolving Lenders obligation to make Revolving
Loans or to purchase and fund risk participations in Swingline Loans pursuant to this Section 2.04(c) shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment,
defense or other right which such Lender may have against the Swingline Lender, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition,
whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; provided, however, that each Revolving Lenders obligation to make Revolving Loans pursuant to this Section 2.04(c) is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 4.02
(other than delivery by the Borrower of a Loan Notice). No such funding of risk participations shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrower to repay Swingline Loans, together with interest as provided herein. 
(d) Repayment of Participations.  (i) At any time after any Revolving Lender has purchased and funded a risk participation in a Swingline Loan, if the Swingline Lender receives any payment on account of such Swingline Loan, the Swingline
Lender will distribute to such Revolving Lender its Applicable Revolving Percentage thereof in the same funds as those received by the Swingline Lender. 
  53 


(ii) If any payment received by the Swingline Lender in respect of principal of or interest
on any Swingline Loan and paid to the Revolving Lenders is required to be returned by the Swingline Lender under any of the circumstances described in Section 10.05 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Swingline Lender in
its discretion), each Revolving Lender shall pay to the Swingline Lender its Applicable Revolving Percentage thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned, at a
rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate. The Administrative Agent will make such demand upon the request of the Swingline Lender. The obligations of the Lenders under this clause shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the
termination of this Agreement.  (e) Interest for Account of Swingline Lender. The Swingline Lender shall be responsible
for invoicing the Borrower for interest on the Swingline Loans. Until each Revolving Lender funds its Base Rate Loan or risk participation pursuant to this Section to refinance such Revolving Lenders Applicable Revolving Percentage of any
Swingline Loan, interest in respect of such Applicable Revolving Percentage shall be solely for the account of the Swingline Lender.  (f) Payments Directly to Swingline Lender. The Borrower shall make all payments of principal and interest in respect of the Swingline Loans directly to the Swingline Lender. 
Section 2.05 Prepayments.  (a) Optional.  (i) The Borrower may, upon notice to the Administrative
Agent, at any time or from time to time voluntarily prepay Term Loans and Revolving Loans in whole or in part without premium or penalty; provided that (A) such notice must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m.
(1) three (3) Business Days prior to any date of prepayment of Eurodollar Rate Loans and (2) on the date of prepayment of Base Rate Loans; and (B) any prepayment of any Loan shall be in a principal amount of $3,000,000 or a whole
multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof; or, in each case, if less, the entire principal amount thereof then outstanding and (3) Bid Loans may not be voluntarily prepaid at any time without the prior written consent of the Lender or Lenders
making such Bid Loans. Each such notice shall specify the date and amount of such prepayment and the Type(s) of Loans to be prepaid and, if Eurodollar Rate Loans are to be prepaid, the Interest Period(s) of such Loans. The Administrative Agent will
promptly notify each Lender of its receipt of each such notice, and of the amount of such Lenders ratable portion of such prepayment (based on such Lenders Applicable Percentage in respect of the relevant Facility). If such notice is
given by the Borrower, the Borrower shall make such prepayment and the prepayment amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein. Any prepayment of principal shall be accompanied by all accrued interest on the
amount prepaid, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.05. Subject to Section 2.15, such prepayments shall be paid to the Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages in respect of each of
the relevant Facilities. 
  54 


(ii) The Borrower may, upon notice to the Swingline Lender (with a copy to the
Administrative Agent), at any time or from time to time, voluntarily prepay Swingline Loans in whole or in part without premium or penalty; provided that (A) such notice must be received by the Swingline Lender and the Administrative Agent not
later than 1:00 p.m. on the date of such prepayment and (B) any such prepayment shall be in a minimum principal amount of $1,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess hereof (or, if less, the entire principal thereof then
outstanding). Each such notice shall specify the date and amount of such prepayment. If such notice is given by the Borrower, the Borrower shall make such prepayment and the prepayment amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the
date specified therein. Any prepayment of principal shall be accompanied by all accrued interest on the amount prepaid, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.05. 
(b) Mandatory.  (i) Outstandings. If for any reason at any time (A) the Total Revolving Outstandings at such time exceed the Revolving Facility as then in effect, (B) the Outstanding Amount of L/C
Obligations at such time exceeds the Letter of Credit Sublimit as then in effect, (C) the Outstanding Amount of Swingline Loans at such time exceeds the Swingline Sublimit as then in effect, (D) the Outstanding Amount of Bid Loans at such
time exceeds the Bid Loan Sublimit as then in effect, (E) the Outstanding Amount of all U.S. Tranche Revolving Loans at such time exceeds the U.S. Tranche Revolving Commitments as then in effect, or (F) the Outstanding Amount of all
Alternative Currency Tranche Revolving Loans at such time exceeds the Alternative Currency Tranche Revolving Commitments as then in effect, the Borrower shall immediately prepay Loans and L/C Borrowings (together with all accrued but unpaid interest
thereon) and/or Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations in an aggregate amount equal to such excess; provided, however, that, subject to the provisions of the last sentence of Section 2.14(a), the Borrower shall not be required to
Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations pursuant to this Section 2.05(b)(i) unless, after the prepayment in full of the Revolving Loans, the Swingline Loans and the Bid Loans, the Total Revolving Outstandings exceed the Revolving Facility at
such time.  (ii) Application of Payments. Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.15, prepayments in respect of
the Revolving Facility made pursuant to this Section 2.05(b), first, shall be applied ratably to the L/C Borrowings and the Swingline Loans, second, shall be applied to the outstanding Revolving Loans, and, third, shall be
used to Cash Collateralize the remaining L/C Obligations. Upon the drawing of any Letter of Credit that has been Cash Collateralized, the funds held as Cash Collateral shall be applied (without any further action by or notice to or from the Borrower
or any Defaulting Lender that has provided Cash Collateral) to reimburse the L/C Issuer or the Revolving Lenders, as applicable.  Within the parameters of the applications set forth above, prepayments pursuant to this Section 2.05(b) shall be applied first to Base Rate Loans and then to Eurodollar Rate Loans in direct order of
Interest Period maturities. All prepayments under this Section 2.05(b) shall be subject to Section 3.05, but otherwise without premium or penalty, and shall be accompanied by interest on the principal amount prepaid through the date of
prepayment. 
  55 


Section 2.06 Termination or Reduction of Commitments. 
(a) Optional. The Borrower may, upon notice to the Administrative Agent, terminate the Revolving Facility, or from time to time
permanently reduce the Revolving Facility; provided that (i) any such notice shall be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. five (5) Business Days prior to the date of termination or reduction, (ii) any
such partial reduction shall be in an aggregate amount of $10,000,000 or any whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and (iii) the Borrower shall not terminate or reduce the Revolving Facility if, after giving effect thereto and to any
concurrent prepayments hereunder, (A) the Total Revolving Outstandings would exceed the Revolving Facility, (B) the Outstanding Amount of L/C Obligations not fully Cash Collateralized hereunder would exceed the Letter of Credit Sublimit,
(C) the Outstanding Amount of Swingline Loans would exceed the Swingline Sublimit, (D) the Outstanding Amount of Bid Loans would exceed the Bid Loan Sublimit (E) the Outstanding Amount of all U.S. Tranche Revolving Loans at such time
would exceed the U.S. Tranche Revolving Commitments as then in effect, or (F) the Outstanding Amount of all Alternative Currency Tranche Revolving Loans at such time would exceed the Alternative Currency Tranche Revolving Commitments as then in
effect. In addition, during the Availability Period in respect of the Term Facility, the Borrower may, upon notice to the Administrative Agent as set forth above, terminate in whole the aggregate Term Commitments. 
(b) Mandatory.  (i) The aggregate Term Commitments shall be automatically and permanently reduced to zero on the date of the Term Borrowing.  (ii) If after giving effect to any reduction or termination of Revolving Commitments under this Section 2.06, the Letter of Credit Sublimit, the Swingline Sublimit, the U.S. Tranche Revolving
Commitments or the Alternative Currency Tranche Revolving Commitments would exceed the Revolving Facility at such time, the Letter of Credit Sublimit, the Swingline Sublimit, the U.S. Tranche Revolving Commitments or the Alternative Currency Tranche
Revolving Commitments, as the case may be, shall be automatically reduced by the amount of such excess.  (c) Application of
Commitment Reductions; Payment of Fees.  (i) The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Lenders of any termination
or reduction of the Revolving Commitments, the Letter of Credit Sublimit, the Swingline Sublimit, the U.S. Tranche Revolving Commitments or the Alternative Currency Tranche Revolving Commitments under this Section 2.06. Upon any reduction of
the Revolving Commitments, the Letter of Credit Sublimit, the Swingline Sublimit, the U.S. Tranche Revolving Commitments or the Alternative Currency Tranche Revolving Commitments, the Revolving Commitment, the Letter of Credit Sublimit, the
Swingline Sublimit, the U.S. Tranche Revolving Commitment and the Alternative Currency Tranche Revolving Commitment of each Revolving Lender, as applicable, shall be reduced by such Lenders Applicable Revolving Percentage of such reduction
amount. All fees in respect of the Revolving Facility accrued until the effective date of any termination of the Revolving Facility shall be paid on the effective date of such termination. 
  56 


(ii) The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Lenders of any termination of the
aggregate Term Commitments under this Section 2.06. All fees in respect of the Term Facility accrued until the effective date of any termination of the Term Facility shall be paid on the effective date of such termination. 
Section 2.07 Repayment of Loans.  (a) Term Loans. The Borrower shall repay to the Term Lenders the aggregate principal amount of all Term Loans outstanding on the Maturity Date for the Term Facility. 
(b) Revolving Loans. The Borrower shall repay to the Revolving Lenders on the Maturity Date for the Revolving Facility the
aggregate principal amount of all Revolving Loans outstanding on such date.  (c) Bid Loans. All outstanding Bid Loans
shall be paid in full on the maturity date thereof as provided in the applicable Bid Loan Quote Request but, in any event, not later than the Maturity Date for the Revolving Facility. 
(d) Swingline Loans. The Borrower shall repay each Swingline Loan on the earlier to occur of (i) the date fifteen
(15) Business Days after such Loan is made and (ii) the fifth Business Day prior to the Maturity Date for the Revolving Facility.  Section 2.08 Interest and Default Rate.  (a) Interest.
Subject to the provisions of Section 2.08(b), (i) each Eurodollar Rate Loan under a Facility shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof for each Interest Period from the applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum
equal to the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Rate for such Facility plus (in the case of a Eurodollar Rate Loan of any Lender which is lent from a Lending Office in the United Kingdom or a Participating Member State) the
Mandatory Cost; (ii) each Base Rate Loan under a Facility shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate for such Facility;
(iii) each Bid Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to the Absolute Rate quoted by the Lender or Lenders making such Bid Loan pursuant to
Section 2.01(c) and (iv) each Swingline Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate for the Revolving Facility.
 (b) Default Rate.  (i) If any amount of principal of any Loan is not paid when due (without regard to any applicable grace periods), whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, such amount shall thereafter
bear interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws.  (ii) If any amount (other than principal of any Loan) payable by the Borrower under any Loan Document is not paid when due (without regard to any applicable

  57 



grace periods), whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, then upon the request of the Required Lenders such amount shall thereafter bear interest at a fluctuating interest rate
per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws.  (iii) Upon the request
of the Required Lenders, while any Event of Default exists, outstanding Obligations (including Letter of Credit Fees) may accrue at a fluctuating rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Laws.  (iv) Accrued and unpaid interest on past due amounts (including interest on past due interest) shall be due and payable
upon demand.  (c) Interest Payments. Interest on each Loan shall be due and payable in arrears on each Interest Payment
Date applicable thereto and at such other times as may be specified herein. Interest hereunder shall be due and payable in accordance with the terms hereof before and after judgment, and before and after the commencement of any proceeding under any
Debtor Relief Law.  Section 2.09 Fees. 
In addition to certain fees described in subsections (h) and (i) of Section 2.03: 
(a) Facility Fee. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Lender in accordance with
its Applicable Revolving Percentage, a facility fee (the Facility Fee) equal to the Applicable Rate times the actual daily amount of the Revolving Facility (or, if the Revolving Facility has terminated, on the Outstanding Amount
of all Revolving Loans, Bid Loans, Swingline Loans and L/C Obligations), regardless of usage, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 2.15. The Facility Fee shall accrue at all times during the Availability Period for the Revolving
Facility (and thereafter so long as any Revolving Loans, Bid Loans, Swingline Loans or L/C Obligations remain outstanding), including at any time during which one or more of the conditions in Article IV is not met, and shall be due and payable
quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December, commencing with the first such date to occur after the Closing Date, and on the last day of the Availability Period for the Revolving Facility (and, if
applicable, thereafter on demand). The Facility Fee shall be calculated quarterly in arrears, and if there is any change in the Applicable Rate during any quarter, the actual daily amount shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Rate
separately for each period during such quarter that such Applicable Rate was in effect.  (b) Commitment Fee. The
Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Term Lender in accordance with its Applicable Percentage of the Term Facility, a commitment fee equal to 17.50 basis points times the daily average amount of the aggregate Term
Commitments, for the period from the Closing Date to and including the earlier of (i) the date the Term Loan is made (or the Term Facility is otherwise terminated) and (ii) sixty (60) days after the Closing Date. The accrued
commitment fee shall be payable on the first Interest Payment Date for the Term Loans, or if there are no such Terms Loans, on the last day of the Availability Period for the Term Facility. 
  58 


(c) Letter of Credit Fees. The Borrower shall pay Letter of Credit fees as set forth
in Sections 2.03(h) and (i).  (d) Other Fees.  (i) The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for its own account such fees as shall have been separately agreed upon in writing in the amounts and at the times so specified. Such fees shall be
fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever.  (ii) The Borrower shall pay to the Lenders
and/or their Affiliates such additional fees as shall have been separately agreed upon in writing in the amounts and at the times so specified. Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever.
 Section 2.10 Computation of Interest and Fees. 
All computations of interest for Base Rate Loans (including Base Rate Loans determined by reference to the Eurodollar Rate) shall be made
on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed. All other computations of fees and interest shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed (which results in more fees or interest, as
applicable, being paid than if computed on the basis of a 365-day year), or, in the case of interest in respect of Alternative Currency Tranche Revolving Loans as to which market practice differs from the foregoing, in accordance with such market
practice. Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which such Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which such Loan or such portion is paid, provided that any Loan that is repaid on the same
day on which it is made shall, subject to Section 2.12(a), bear interest for one (1) day. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest
error.  Section 2.11 Evidence of Debt. 
(a) Maintenance of Accounts. The Credit Extensions made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records
maintained by such Lender and by the Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of business. The accounts or records maintained by the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of the Credit
Extensions made by the Lenders to the Borrower and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing
with respect to the Obligations. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the
Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. Upon the request of any Lender made through the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative Agent) a Note, which shall
evidence such Lenders Loans in addition to such accounts or records. Each Lender may attach schedules to its Note and endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto.

  59 


(b) Maintenance of Records. In addition to the accounts and records referred to in
Section 2.11(a), each Lender and the Administrative Agent shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice accounts or records evidencing the purchases and sales by such Lender of participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans. In
the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by the Administrative Agent and the accounts and records of any Lender in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the
absence of manifest error.  Section 2.12 Payments Generally; Administrative Agents Clawback.
 (a) General. All payments to be made by the Borrower shall be made free and clear of and without condition or
deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff. All payments of principal of and interest on any Loan shall be payable in the same currency as such Loan is denominated. All payments of fees pursuant to Section 2.09 shall be
payable in Dollars. All payments in respect of Unreimbursed Amounts shall be payable in the currency provided in Section 2.03. All other payments herein shall be payable in the currency specified with respect to such payment or, if the currency
is not specified, in Dollars. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, (x) all payments by the Borrower in Dollars hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is
owed, at the Administrative Agents Office in Dollars and in Same Day Funds not later than 2:00 p.m. (New York time) on the date specified herein and (y) all payments by the Borrower in any Alternative Currency hereunder shall be made to
the Administrative Agents Office for payments in such Alternative Currency and in Same Day Funds not later than the Applicable Time specified by the Administrative Agent on the date specified herein. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Administrative Agent may require that any payments due under this Agreement be made in the United States. If, for any reason, the Borrower is prohibited by any Law from making any required payment hereunder in an Alternative Currency,
the Borrower shall make such payment in Dollars in the Dollar Equivalent of the Alternative Currency payment amount. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Applicable Percentage in respect of the relevant Facility (or
other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lenders Lending Office. All payments received by the Administrative Agent after 2:00 p.m. (in the case of payments in Dollars) or the
Applicable Time specified by the Administrative Agent (in the case of payments in an Alternative Currency) shall be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue. Subject to the
definition of Interest Period, and as otherwise specifically provided for in this Agreement, if any payment to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following
Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be.  (b) (i)
Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing of Eurodollar Rate Loans (or, in the case of any Borrowing of Base
Rate Loans, prior to 12:00 noon on the date of such Borrowing) that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lenders share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share
available on such date in accordance with Section 2.02 (or, in the case of a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, that such Lender has made such share 
  60 



available in accordance with and at the time required by Section 2.02) and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a
Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then such Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in Same Day
Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the
greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative
Agent in connection with the foregoing and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans. If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the
same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the Administrative Agent,
then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lenders Loan included in such Borrowing as of the date of such Borrowing. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have
failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.  (ii) Payments by Borrower; Presumptions by Administrative
Agent. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the L/C Issuer hereunder that the Borrower will not
make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Appropriate Lenders or the L/C Issuer, as the case may
be, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Appropriate Lenders or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, receiving any such payment severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent
forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the
Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation. 
A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this subsection (b) shall
be conclusive, absent manifest error.  (c) Failure to Satisfy Conditions Precedent. If any Lender makes available to the
Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this Article II, and such funds are not made available to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable
Credit Extension set forth in Article IV are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall promptly return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest.

  61 


(d) Obligations of Lenders Several. The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make
Term Loans and Revolving Loans, to fund participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans and to make payments pursuant to Section 10.04(c) are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan, to fund any such
participation or to make any payment under Section 10.04(c) on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other
Lender to so make its Loan, to purchase its participation or to make its payment under Section 10.04(c).  (e) Funding
Source. Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any
particular place or manner.  (f) Pro Rata Treatment. Except to the extent otherwise provided herein: (i) each
Borrowing (other than Swingline Borrowings and Bid Loans) shall be made from the Appropriate Lenders, each payment of fees under Sections 2.03(h) and (i) and Sections 2.09(a) and (b) shall be made for account of the Appropriate Lenders,
and each termination or reduction of the amount of the Commitments shall be applied to the respective Commitments of the Lenders, pro rata according to the amounts of their respective Commitments; (ii) each Borrowing (other than Swingline
Borrowings and Bid Loans) shall be allocated pro rata among the Lenders according to the amounts of their respective Commitments (in the case of the making of Revolving Loans and Term Loans) or their respective Loans that are to be included in such
Borrowing (in the case of conversions and continuations of Loans); (iii) each payment or prepayment of principal of Loans by the Borrower (other than Swingline Borrowings and Bid Loans) shall be made for account of the Appropriate Lenders pro
rata in accordance with the respective unpaid principal amounts of the Loans held by them; and (iv) each payment of interest on Loans (other than Swingline Borrowings and Bid Loans) by the Borrower shall be made for account of the Appropriate
Lenders pro rata in accordance with the amounts of interest on such Loans then due and payable to the respective Appropriate Lenders.  Section 2.13 Sharing of Payments by Lenders.  (a) If any Lender
shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of (a) Obligations in respect of any of the Facilities due and payable to such Lender hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such time in
excess of its ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Obligations due and payable to such Lender at such time to (ii) the aggregate amount of the Obligations in respect of the Facilities due and payable to all
Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such time) of payments on account of the Obligations in respect of the Facilities due and payable to all Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such time obtained by all the
Lenders at such time or (b) Obligations in respect of any of the Facilities owing (but not due and payable) to such Lender hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such time in excess of its ratable share (according to the proportion of
(i) the amount of such Obligations owing (but not due and payable) to such Lender at such time to (ii) the aggregate amount of the Obligations in respect of the Facilities owing (but not due and payable) to all Lenders hereunder and under
the other Loan Documents at such time) of payments on account of the Obligations in respect of 
  62 



the Facilities owing (but not due and payable) to all Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such time obtained by all of the Lenders at such time, then, in each case under
clauses (a) and (b) above, the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (A) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact and (B) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and subparticipations in L/C
Obligations and Swingline Loans of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of Obligations in
respect of the Facilities then due and payable to the Lenders or owing (but not due and payable) to the Lenders, as the case may be, provided that:  (1) if any such participations or subparticipations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations or subparticipations shall be rescinded and
the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and  (2) the provisions of this Section shall
not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by or on behalf of the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender),
(y) the application of Cash Collateral provided for in Section 2.14, or (z) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or subparticipations in L/C Obligations
or Swingline Loans to any assignee or participant, other than an assignment to the Borrower or any Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this Section shall apply).  (b) If a Lender shall effect payment of any principal of or interest or fee on Bid Loans made as part of the same Bid Loan Borrowing held by it under this Agreement through the exercise of any right of
set-off, bankers lien, counterclaim or similar right, it shall promptly purchase from the other Lenders holding such Bid Loans participations in such Bid Loans held by the other Lenders holding such Bid Loans in such amounts, and make such
other adjustments from time to time as shall be equitable, to the end that all the Lenders holding such Bid Loans shall share the benefit of such payment pro rata in accordance with the unpaid amount of principal and interest or fee on Bid Loans of
the same Bid Loan Borrowing held by each of them. To such end all such Lenders shall make appropriate adjustments among themselves (by the resale of participations sold or otherwise) if such payment is rescinded or must otherwise be restored. The
Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation in Bid Loans of the same Bid Loan Borrowing held by other Lenders may exercise all rights of set-off, bankers lien, counterclaim or similar rights with respect to such participation
as fully as if such Lender were a direct holder of such Bid Loans in the amount of such participation.  (c) Nothing contained
herein shall require any Lender to exercise any such right or shall affect the right of any Lender to exercise and retain the benefits of exercising, any such right with respect to any other indebtedness or obligation of the Borrower. 
(d) The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable Law, that any Lender
acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with 
  63 



respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation. 
Section 2.14 Cash Collateral.  (a) Certain Credit Support Events. If (i) the L/C Issuer has honored any full or partial drawing request under any Letter of Credit and such drawing has resulted in an L/C Borrowing,
(ii) as of the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, any L/C Obligation for any reason remains outstanding, (iii) the Borrower shall be required to provide Cash Collateral pursuant to Section 2.05 or 8.02(c), or (iv) there shall
exist a Defaulting Lender, the Borrower shall immediately (in the case of clause (iii) above) or within one (1) Business Day (in all other cases) following any request by the Administrative Agent or the L/C Issuer, provide Cash Collateral
in an amount not less than the applicable Minimum Collateral Amount (determined in the case of Cash Collateral provided pursuant to clause (iv) above, after giving effect to Section 2.15(a)(iv) and any Cash Collateral provided by such
Defaulting Lender). The Administrative Agent may, at any time and from time to time after the initial deposit of Cash Collateral, request that additional Cash Collateral be provided in order to protect against the results of exchange rate
fluctuations.  (b) Grant of Security Interest. The Borrower, and to the extent provided by any Defaulting Lender, such
Defaulting Lender, hereby grants to (and subjects to the control of) the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and the Lenders, and agrees to maintain, a first priority security interest in all cash,
deposit accounts and all balances therein, and all other property so provided as collateral pursuant hereto, and in all proceeds of the foregoing, all as security for the obligations to which such Cash Collateral may be applied pursuant to
Section 2.14(c). If at any time the Administrative Agent determines that Cash Collateral is subject to any right or claim of any Person other than the Administrative Agent or the L/C Issuer as herein provided, or that the total amount of such
Cash Collateral is less than the Minimum Collateral Amount, the Borrower will, promptly upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay or provide to the Administrative Agent additional Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to eliminate such
deficiency. All Cash Collateral (other than credit support not constituting funds subject to deposit) shall be maintained in blocked, non-interest bearing deposit accounts at the Administrative Agent. The Borrower shall pay on demand therefor from
time to time all customary account opening, activity and other administrative fees and charges in connection with the maintenance and disbursement of Cash Collateral.  (c) Application. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Cash Collateral provided under any of this Section 2.14 or Sections 2.03, 2.05, 2.15 or 8.02 in respect
of Letters of Credit shall be held and applied to the satisfaction of the specific L/C Obligations, obligations to fund participations therein (including, as to Cash Collateral provided by a Revolving Lender that is a Defaulting Lender, any interest
accrued on such obligation) and other obligations for which such Cash Collateral was so provided, prior to any other application of such property as may be provided for herein.  (d) Release. Cash Collateral (or the appropriate portion thereof) provided to reduce Fronting Exposure or other obligations shall be released promptly following (i) the elimination of the
applicable Fronting Exposure or other obligations giving rise thereto (including by the termination of Defaulting Lender status of the applicable Revolving Lender (or, 
  64 



as appropriate, its assignee following compliance with Section 10.06(b)(vi))) or (ii) the determination by the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer that there exists excess Cash
Collateral; provided, however, (A) any such release shall be without prejudice to, and any disbursement or other transfer of Cash Collateral shall be and remain subject to, any other Lien conferred under the Loan Documents and the other
applicable provisions of the Loan Documents and (B) the Person providing Cash Collateral and the L/C Issuer may agree that Cash Collateral shall not be released but instead held to support future anticipated Fronting Exposure or other
obligations.  Section 2.15 Defaulting Lenders. 
(a) Adjustments. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender,
then, until such time as that Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable Law:  (i)
Waivers and Amendments. Such Defaulting Lenders right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in the definition of Required Lenders and
Section 10.01.  (ii) Defaulting Lender Waterfall. Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts
received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Article VIII or otherwise) or received by the Administrative Agent from a Defaulting Lender pursuant to
Section 10.08 shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder; second,
to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the L/C Issuer or Swingline Lender hereunder; third, to Cash Collateralize the L/C Issuers Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender in
accordance with Section 2.14; fourth, as the Borrower may request (so long as no Default or Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as
required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent; fifth, if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to be held in a deposit account and released pro rata in order to (A) satisfy such Defaulting
Lenders potential future funding obligations with respect to Loans under this Agreement and (B) Cash Collateralize the L/C Issuers future Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender with respect to future Letters of
Credit issued under this Agreement, in accordance with Section 2.14; sixth, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders, the L/C Issuer or the Swingline Lender as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction
obtained by any Lender, the L/C Issuer or the Swingline Lender against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement; seventh, so long as no Default or Event of Default
exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lenders breach of its
obligations under this Agreement; and eighth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise as may be required under the Loan Documents in connection with any Lien conferred thereunder or directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided
that if (1) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans or L/C Borrowings in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its 
  65 



appropriate share and (2) such Loans were made or the related Letters of Credit were issued at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 were satisfied or waived, such
payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of, and L/C Obligations owed to, all Non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of, or L/C Obligations owed to, such Defaulting Lender until such
time as all Loans and funded and unfunded participations in L/C Obligations and Swingline Loans are held by the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the Commitments hereunder without giving effect to Section 2.15(a)(v). Any payments, prepayments
or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section 2.15(a)(ii) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such
Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.  (iii) Certain Fees. 
(A) Fees. Each Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive fees payable under Section 2.09(a) for any period during which
that Lender is a Defaulting Lender only to extent allocable to the sum of (1) the outstanding principal amount of the Revolving Loans funded by it and (2) its Applicable Revolving Percentage of the stated amount of Letters of Credit for
which it has provided Cash Collateral pursuant to Section 2.14. No Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive any fee payable under Section 2.09(b) for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and the Borrower shall
not be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender).  (B)
Letter of Credit Fees. Each Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive Letter of Credit Fees for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender only to the extent allocable to its Applicable Revolving Percentage of the stated
amount of Letters of Credit for which it has provided Cash Collateral pursuant to Section 2.14.  (C) Defaulting Lender
Fees. With respect to any fee payable under Section 2.09(a) or any Letter of Credit Fee not required to be paid to any Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (A) or (B) above, the Borrower shall (1) pay to each Non-Defaulting
Lender that portion of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender with respect to such Defaulting Lenders participation in L/C Obligations or Swingline Loans that has been reallocated to such Non-Defaulting Lender pursuant to
clause (iv) below, (2) pay to the L/C Issuer and Swingline Lender, as applicable, the amount of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender to the extent allocable to the L/C Issuers or Swingline Lenders Fronting
Exposure to such Defaulting Lender and (3) not be required to pay the remaining amount of any such fee.  (iv)
Reallocation of Applicable Revolving Percentages to Reduce Fronting Exposure. All or any part of such Defaulting Lenders participation in L/C Obligations and Swingline Loans shall be reallocated among the Non-Defaulting Lenders in
accordance with their respective Applicable Revolving Percentages (calculated without regard to such Defaulting Lenders Commitment) but only to the extent that (A) the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 are satisfied at the time of
such reallocation (and, unless the Borrower shall have otherwise notified the Administrative Agent at such time, the Borrower shall be deemed to have represented and 
  66 



warranted that such conditions are satisfied at such time) and (B) such reallocation does not cause the Revolving Exposure of any Non-Defaulting Lender to exceed such Non-Defaulting
Lenders Revolving Commitment. No reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a
Non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such Non-Defaulting Lenders increased exposure following such reallocation.  (v)
Cash Collateral, Repayment of Swingline Loans. If the reallocation described in clause (a)(iv) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrower shall, without prejudice to any right or remedy available to it hereunder or under
applicable Law, (A) first, prepay Swingline Loans in an amount equal to the Swingline Lenders Fronting Exposure and (B) second, Cash Collateralize the L/C Issuers Fronting Exposure in accordance with the procedures set forth in
Section 2.14.  (b) Defaulting Lender Cure. If the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lender and the
L/C Issuer agree in writing that a Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender (provided that the Borrowers agreement shall not be required if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of such agreement), the Administrative
Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any Cash Collateral), that Lender will, to the
extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Letters of
Credit and Swingline Loans to be held on a pro rata basis by the Lenders in accordance with their Applicable Percentages (without giving effect to Section 2.15(a)(iv)), whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided
that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise
expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lenders having been a Defaulting Lender. 
Section 2.16 Increase in Revolving Facility.  (a) The Borrower may at its sole expense and effort and after consulting with the Administrative Agent, request: (i) one or more Lenders acceptable to the Administrative Agent to increase (in the
sole and absolute discretion of each such Lender) the amount of their respective Revolving Commitments, and/or (ii) one or more other lending institutions acceptable to the Administrative Agent (each, a New Revolving Lender)
to become Revolving Lenders and extend Revolving Commitments hereunder (each such existing Lender and each New Revolving Lender being referred to as a Proposed Revolving Lender). To request an increase pursuant to this
Section 2.16 (the Revolving Facility Increase), the Borrower shall submit to the Administrative Agent a written increase request signed by the Borrower and in form approved by the Administrative Agent (the Revolving
Increase Request), which shall specify, as the case may be: (A) each such existing Lender and the amount of the proposed increase to its Revolving Commitment, or (B) the proposed Revolving Commitment for each New Revolving

  67 



Lender. Promptly following receipt of the Revolving Increase Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Proposed Revolving Lender of the details thereof. 
(b) If one or more Proposed Revolving Lender(s) shall have unconditionally agreed to such Revolving Increase Request in a writing
delivered to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at any time prior to the 30th day following the date of the delivery to such Proposed Revolving Lenders(s) of the Revolving Increase Request (each such Proposed Revolving Lender being
hereinafter referred to as an Incremental Revolving Lender), then: (x) each such Incremental Revolving Lender which shall then be an existing Lender shall have its Revolving Commitment increased by the amount set forth in the
Revolving Increase Request and (y) each such Incremental Revolving Lender which shall then be a New Lender shall be and become a Revolving Lender hereunder having a Revolving Commitment equal to the amount set forth in such
Revolving Increase Request, provided, however, that (1) immediately before and after giving effect thereto, no Default or Event of Default shall or would exist, (2) each such Incremental Revolving Lender shall have executed
and delivered to the Administrative Agent a supplement to this Agreement providing for its increased Revolving Commitment or its Revolving Commitment, as applicable, in form approved by the Administrative Agent, (3) immediately after giving
effect thereto, the aggregate amount of the increase to the Revolving Facility established pursuant to this Section 2.16 and the Incremental Term Loan Commitments established pursuant to Section 2.17 shall not exceed $1,000,000,000,
(4) the increase of the Revolving Facility specified in the Revolving Increase Request shall be not less than $25,000,000 or an integral multiple thereof, (5) the minimum Revolving Commitment extended by each Incremental Revolving Lender
which is a New Revolving Lender shall be in an amount of not less than $15,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, and (6) the minimum increase to the Revolving Commitment extended by each Incremental Revolving Lender
which is an existing Lender shall be in an amount of not less than $5,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof. Any increase in the Revolving Facility shall not increase the Letter of Credit Commitment or Swing Line
Commitment.  (c) Simultaneously with each Revolving Facility Increase under this Section 2.16, each Incremental Revolving
Lender shall, to the extent necessary, purchase from each other existing Lender, and each other existing Lender shall sell to each Incremental Revolving Lender, in each case at par and without representation, warranty, or recourse (in accordance
with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 10.13), such principal amount of Revolving Loans of such other existing Lender(s), together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, as will result, after giving effect to such
transaction, in each Lenders Applicable Revolving Percentage of outstanding Revolving Loans being equal to such Lenders Applicable Revolving Percentage of the Revolving Facility, provided that each such assignor Lender
shall have received (to the extent of the interests, rights and obligations assigned) payment then due and owing of the outstanding principal amount of its Revolving Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees, commissions and all other amounts
payable to it under the Loan Documents from the applicable assignee Lenders (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest, fees and commissions) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts). 
(d) Conflicting Provisions. This Section shall supersede any provisions in Section 2.13 or 10.01 to the contrary. 
  68 


Section 2.17 Incremental Term Loan Commitments. 
(a) In the event that the Lenders shall have made the initial Term Loans pursuant to Section 2.01(a) on or prior to the last day of
the Availability Period for the Term Facility, the Borrower may at its sole expense and effort and after consulting with the Administrative Agent, at any time after the last day of the Availability Period for the Term Facility, request: (i) one
or more Lenders to establish (in the sole and absolute discretion of each such Lender) additional Term Commitments and/or (ii) one or more other lending institutions acceptable to the Administrative Agent (each, a New Term
Lender) to become Term Lenders and establish Term Commitments hereunder (each such existing Lender and each New Term Lender being referred to as a Proposed Term Lender). To request an extension of additional
or new Term Commitments pursuant to this Section 2.17 (the Incremental Term Commitment), the Borrower shall submit to the Administrative Agent a written request signed by the Borrower and in form approved by the
Administrative Agent (the Incremental Term Loan Request), which shall specify, as the case may be: (A) each such existing Lender and the amount of the proposed Incremental Term Commitment, or (B) the proposed Term
Commitment for each New Term Lender. Promptly following receipt of the Incremental Term Loan Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Proposed Term Lender of the details thereof. 
(b) If one or more Proposed Term Lender(s) shall have unconditionally agreed to such Incremental Term Loan Request in a writing delivered
to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at any time prior to the 30th day following the date of the delivery to such Proposed Term Lender(s) of the Incremental Term Loan Request (each such Proposed Term Lender being hereinafter referred to as
an Incremental Term Lender), then: (x) each such Incremental Term Lender which shall then be an existing Lender shall have its Term Loan Commitment increased by the amount set forth in the Incremental Term Loan Request and
(y) each such Incremental Term Lender which shall then be a New Term Lender shall be and become a Term Lender hereunder having a Term Loan Commitment equal to the amount set forth in such Incremental Term Loan Request,
provided, however, that (1) immediately before and after giving effect thereto, no Default or Event of Default shall or would exist, (2) each such Incremental Term Lender shall have executed and delivered to the
Administrative Agent a supplement to this Agreement providing for its increased Term Commitment or its Term Commitment, as applicable, in form approved by the Administrative Agent, (3) immediately after giving effect thereto, the aggregate
amount of the Incremental Revolving Commitments established pursuant to Section 2.16 and the Incremental Term Loan Commitments established pursuant to this Section 2.17 shall not exceed $1,000,000,000, (4) the increase of the Term
Facility specified in the Incremental Term Loan Request shall be not less than $25,000,000 or an integral multiple thereof, (5) the minimum Term Commitment established by each Incremental Term Lender which is a New Term Lender shall be in an
amount of not less than $15,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, (6) the minimum increase to the Term Commitment established by each Incremental Term Lender which is an existing Lender shall be in an amount of not
less than $5,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and (7) on the effective date of each Incremental Term Commitment, the Borrower shall borrow an amount equal to the full amount of such Incremental Term Commitment.

Section 2.18 Extension of Maturity Date for Revolving Facility.
 Subject to the following provisions, the Borrower shall have the option to extend the initial Maturity Date for the
Revolving Facility to March 31, 2018. By written notice to the Administrative Agent delivered at least 30 days, but not more than 90 days, prior to the initial Maturity Date for the Revolving Facility, so long as no Default or Event of Default
has occurred, the Borrower may request such extension of the initial Maturity Date for the Revolving Facility (which request shall be accompanied by a Compliance Certificate). Promptly upon receipt of such written notice, the Administrative Agent
shall deliver a copy to each Revolving Lender and the initial Maturity Date for the Revolving Facility shall be deemed so extended. In the event that the Borrower shall have delivered an extension notice under this Section 2.18 the Borrower
shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the ratable benefit of the Lenders on the initial Maturity Date for the Revolving Facility, a non-refundable extension fee in an amount equal to 15 basis points multiplied by the Revolving Facility, as then
in effect.  Section 2.19 Extension of Maturity Date for Term Facility. 
Subject to the following provisions, the Borrower shall have the option to extend the Maturity Date for the Term Facility then in effect
hereunder (the Existing Maturity Date for the Term Facility), for two one year periods. By written notice to the Administrative Agent delivered at least 30 days, but not more than 90 days, prior to the Existing Maturity Date for
the Term Facility, so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred, the Borrower may request a one year extension of the Existing Maturity Date for the Term Facility (which request shall be accompanied by a Compliance Certificate). Promptly
upon receipt of each such written notice, the Administrative Agent shall deliver a copy to each Lender and the Existing Maturity Date for the Term Facility shall be deemed extended for a one year period. In the event that the Borrower shall have
delivered an extension notice under this Section 2.19 the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the ratable benefit of the Lenders on each Existing Maturity Date for the Term Facility, a non-refundable extension fee in an amount
equal to 12.5 basis points multiplied by the Term Facility, as then in effect. In no event shall the Maturity Date for the Term Facility extend beyond March 31, 2018.  ARTICLE III  TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY 
Section 3.01 Taxes.  (a) Payments Free of Taxes; Obligation to Withhold; Payments on Account of Taxes.  (i) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower under any Loan Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable Laws. If
any applicable Laws (as determined in the good faith discretion of the Administrative Agent) require the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by the Administrative Agent or the Borrower, then the Administrative Agent or the
Borrower shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding, upon the basis of the information and documentation to be delivered pursuant to subsection (e) below. 
  70 


(ii) If the Borrower or the Administrative Agent shall be required by the Code to withhold
or deduct any Taxes, including both United States federal backup withholding and withholding taxes, from any payment, then (A) the Administrative Agent shall withhold or make such deductions as are determined by the Administrative Agent to be
required based upon the information and documentation it has received pursuant to subsection (e) below, (B) the Administrative Agent shall timely pay the full amount withheld or deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance
with the Code and (C) to the extent that the withholding or deduction is made on account of Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the Borrower shall be increased as necessary so that after any required withholding or the making of all required
deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 3.01) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such withholding or deduction been made. 
(iii) If the Borrower or the Administrative Agent shall be required by any applicable Laws other than the Code to withhold or deduct any
Taxes from any payment, then (A) the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as required by such Laws, shall withhold or make such deductions as are determined by it to be required based upon the information and documentation it has received
pursuant to subsection (e) below, (B) the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, to the extent required by such Laws, shall timely pay the full amount withheld or deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with such Laws
and (C) to the extent that the withholding or deduction is made on account of Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the Borrower shall be increased as necessary so that after any required withholding or the making of all required deductions
(including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 3.01) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such withholding or deduction been made. 
(b) Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower. Without limiting the provisions of subsection (a) above, the Borrower shall
timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Law, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes. 
(c) Tax Indemnifications.  (i) The Borrower shall, and does hereby, indemnify each Recipient, and shall make payment in respect thereof within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes
(including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 3.01) payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient, and any penalties,
interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or
liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or the L/C Issuer (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or the L/C Issuer, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The
Borrower shall also, and does hereby, indemnify the Administrative Agent, and shall make payment in respect thereof within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for any amount which a Lender or the L/C Issuer for any reason fails to pay
indefeasibly to the Administrative Agent as required pursuant to Section 3.01(c)(ii). 
  71 


(ii) Each Lender and the L/C Issuer shall, and does hereby, severally indemnify and shall
make payment in respect thereof within ten (10) days after demand therefor, (A) the Administrative Agent against any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender or the L/C Issuer (but only to the extent that the Borrower has not already
indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), (B) the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, as applicable, against any Taxes attributable to such Lenders
failure to comply with the provisions of Section 10.06(d) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (C) the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, as applicable, against any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender or the
L/C Issuer, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent or the Borrower in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or
legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender and the L/C
Issuer hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, under this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any amount due to the
Administrative Agent under this clause (ii).  (d) Evidence of Payments. Upon request by the Borrower or the
Administrative Agent, as the case may be, after any payment of Taxes by the Borrower or by the Administrative Agent to a Governmental Authority as provided in this Section 3.01, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent or the
Administrative Agent shall deliver to the Borrower, as the case may be, the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of any return required by Laws to report such payment or
other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be.  (e)
Status of Lenders; Tax Documentation.  (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of
withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and
executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower
or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable Law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not
such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such
documentation set forth in Section 3.01(e)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D)) shall not be required if in such Lenders reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or
expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. 
  72 


(ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that the Borrower is a
U.S. Person,  (A) any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to
the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt
from U.S. federal backup withholding tax;  (B) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so,
deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon
the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:  (1) in the
case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN establishing an exemption from,
or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the interest article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN establishing an exemption from, or
reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the business profits or other income article of such tax treaty;  (2) executed originals of IRS Form W-8ECI;  (3) in the case of a Foreign Lender
claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a bank within the
meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a 10 percent shareholder of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a controlled foreign corporation described in
Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate) and (y) executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN; or  (4) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed originals of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in
the form of Exhibit H-2 or Exhibit H-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners
of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner; 
(C) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in
such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the
Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by

applicable Law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by
applicable Law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and  (D) if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements
of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times
reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable Law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the
Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lenders obligations under FATCA or to
determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (D), FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. 
(iii) Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered pursuant to this Section 3.01 expires or becomes
obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so. 
(f) Treatment of Certain Refunds. Unless required by applicable Laws, at no time shall the Administrative Agent have any
obligation to file for or otherwise pursue on behalf of a Lender or the L/C Issuer, or have any obligation to pay to any Lender or the L/C Issuer, any refund of Taxes withheld or deducted from funds paid for the account of such Lender or the L/C
Issuer, as the case may be. If any Recipient determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid
additional amounts pursuant to this Section 3.01, it shall pay to the Borrower an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section 3.01 with
respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) and net of any loss or gain realized in the conversion of such funds from or to another currency incurred by such Recipient, as the case may be,
and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund), provided that the Borrower, upon the request of the Recipient, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any
penalties, in

ired to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
subsection, in no event will the applicable Recipient be required to pay any amount to the Borrower pursuant to this subsection the payment of which would place the Recipient in a less favorable net after-Tax position than such Recipient would have
been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise with respect to such refund had never been paid.
This subsection shall not be construed to require the Recipient to make 
  74 



available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to, or to file for or otherwise pursue any refund on behalf of, the Borrower or any other
Person.  (g) Survival. Each partys obligations under this Section 3.01 shall survive the resignation or
replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender or the L/C Issuer, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other Obligations. 
Section 3.02 Illegality.  If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose
interest is determined by reference to the Eurodollar Rate, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell,
or to take deposits of, any Approved Currency in the London interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, (a) any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Eurodollar Rate Loans
or to convert Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended and (b) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or maintaining Base Rate Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the Eurodollar
Rate component of the Base Rate, the interest rate on such Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate, in
each case until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, (i) the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a
copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all Eurodollar Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined
by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans to such day, or
immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans and (ii) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate, the Administrative
Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the Eurodollar Rate component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer
illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted. 
Section 3.03 Inability to Determine Rates.  If the Required Lenders determine that for any reason in connection with any request for a Eurodollar Rate Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof that (a) deposits (whether denominated in
Dollars or an Alternative Currency) are not being offered to banks in the applicable offshore interbank market for such currency for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Eurodollar Rate Loan, (b) adequate and reasonable means do
not exist for 
  75 



determining the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan (whether denominated in Dollars or an Alternative Currency) or in connection with
an existing or proposed Base Rate Loan, or (c) the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Loan, the
Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, (i) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies shall be suspended and (ii) in the
event of a determination described in the preceding sentence with respect to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate, the utilization of the Eurodollar Rate component in determining the Base Rate shall be suspended, in each case until the
Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans in the
affected currency or currencies under the appropriate Facility or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans under the appropriate Facility in the amount specified therein.
 Section 3.04 Increased Costs; Reserves on Eurodollar Rate Loans. 
(a) Increased Costs Generally. If any Change in Law shall: 
(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against
assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except (A) any reserve requirement contemplated by Section 3.04(e) and (B) the requirements of the Bank of England and the Financial
Services Authority or the European Central Bank to the extent reflected in the Mandatory Cost, other than as set forth below) or the L/C Issuer;  (ii) subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection
Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto;  (iii) result in the failure of the Mandatory Cost, as calculated hereunder, to represent the cost to any Lender of complying with the requirements of the Bank of England and/or the Financial Services
Authority or the European Central Bank in relation to its making, funding or maintaining Eurodollar Rate Loans; or  (iv)
impose on any Lender or the L/C Issuer or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Rate Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein; 
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Loan the
interest on which is determined by reference to the Eurodollar Rate (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan), or to increase the cost to such Lender or the L/C Issuer of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit
(or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of Credit), 
  76 



or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or the L/C Issuer hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender or the
L/C Issuer, the Borrower will pay to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
 (b) Capital Requirements. If any Lender or the L/C Issuer determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or
the L/C Issuer or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lenders or the L/C Issuers holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lenders
or the L/C Issuers capital or on the capital of such Lenders or the L/C Issuers holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of
Credit or Swingline Loans held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the L/C Issuer, to a level below that which such Lender or the L/C Issuer or such Lenders or the L/C Issuers holding company could have achieved but for
such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lenders or the L/C Issuers policies and the policies of such Lenders or the L/C Issuers holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower
will pay to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer or such Lenders or the L/C Issuers holding company for any such reduction suffered.
 (c) Certificates for Reimbursement. A certificate of a Lender or the L/C Issuer setting forth the amount or amounts
necessary to compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) of this Section and delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower
shall pay such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within ten (10) days after receipt thereof.  (d) Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the L/C Issuer to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.04 shall not constitute a
waiver of such Lenders or the L/C Issuers right to demand such compensation, provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or the L/C Issuer pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section for any increased
costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine (9) months prior to the date that such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such
Lenders or the L/C Issuers intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine (9) month period referred to above shall be
extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).  (e) Reserves on Eurodollar Rate Loans. The Borrower
shall pay to each Lender, as long as such Lender shall be required to maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including Eurocurrency funds or deposits (currently known as Eurocurrency liabilities),
additional interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Eurodollar Rate Loan equal to the actual costs of such reserves allocated to such Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive),
which shall be due and payable on each date on which interest is payable on such Loan, provided the 
  77 



Borrower shall have received at least ten (10) days prior notice (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of such additional interest from such Lender. If a Lender fails to give
notice ten (10) days prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date, such additional interest shall be due and payable ten (10) days from receipt of such notice.  Section 3.05 Compensation for Losses.  Upon demand of any
Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of: 
(a) any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the
Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise);  (b) any
failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert into any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower; 
(c) any failure by the Borrower to make payment of any Loan or drawing under any Letter of Credit (or interest due thereon) denominated in
an Alternative Currency on its scheduled due date or any payment thereof in a different currency; or  (d) any assignment of a
Eurodollar Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 10.13;  including any loss of anticipated profits and any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits
from which such funds were obtained. The Borrower shall also pay any customary administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing.  For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under this Section 3.05, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Eurodollar Rate Loan made by it at the Eurodollar
Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the offshore interbank market for such currency for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Eurodollar Rate Loan was in fact so funded. A certificate of a
Lender setting forth in detail sufficient to enable the Borrower to verify the computation of the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender as specified in this Section and delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest
error.  Section 3.06 Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders. 
(a) Designation of a Different Lending Office. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.04, or requires the
Borrower to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender, the L/C Issuer, or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender or the L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 3.01, or if any Lender gives a notice pursuant to
Section 3.02, then at the request of the Borrower, such Lender or the L/C Issuer shall, as applicable, use reasonable efforts to designate a different Lending Office for funding or booking

  78 



its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or Affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender or the L/C Issuer, such designation or
assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.01 or 3.04, as the case may be, in the future, or eliminate the need for the notice pursuant to Section 3.02, as applicable, and (ii) in each case,
would not subject such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all
reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender or the L/C Issuer in connection with any such designation or assignment. 
(b) Replacement of Lenders. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.04, or if the Borrower is required to pay any
Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.01 and, in each case, such Lender has declined or is unable to designate a different lending office in
accordance with Section 3.06(a), the Borrower may replace such Lender in accordance with Section 10.13. 
Section 3.07 Survival.  All of the Borrowers obligations under this Article III shall survive termination of the Aggregate Commitments, repayment of all other Obligations hereunder, resignation of the Administrative Agent
and the Facility Termination Date.  ARTICLE IV  CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO CREDIT EXTENSIONS  Section 4.01

such Governmental Authority), the resolutions of the governing body of the Borrower, the good standing, existence or its equivalent of the Borrower and of the incumbency of the Responsible Officers. 
  79 


(c) Legal Opinion of Counsel. The Administrative Agent shall have received a written
opinion (addressed to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and dated the Closing Date) from Shumaker, Loop & Kendrick, LLP, counsel to the Borrower, covering such matters relating to the Borrower and this Agreement as the Required
Lenders shall reasonably request. The Borrower hereby requests such counsel to deliver such opinion.  (d) Financial
Statements. The Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall have received copies of the Financial Statements referred to in Section 5.09, each in form and substance satisfactory to each of them.

to one or more written agreements including without limitation, this Agreement.  Without limiting the generality of the provisions of the last
paragraph of Section 9.03, for purposes of determining compliance with the conditions specified in this Section, each Lender that has signed this Agreement shall be deemed to have consented to, approved or accepted or to be satisfied with each
document or other matter required thereunder to be consented to or approved by or acceptable or satisfactory to a Lender, unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from such Lender prior to the proposed Closing Date specifying its

  80 


Section 4.02 Conditions to all Credit Extensions. 
The obligation of each Lender and the L/C Issuer to honor any Request for Credit Extension (other than a Loan Notice requesting only a
conversion of Loans to the other Type, or a continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans) is subject to the following conditions precedent:  (a) The representations and warranties of the Borrower contained in Article II, Article V or any other Loan Document, or which are contained in any document furnished at any time under or in connection
herewith or therewith, shall be true and correct on and as of the date of such Credit Extension (provided for purposes of this Section 4.02, the representations and warranties contained in Section 5.09(a), other than the penultimate
sentence thereof, shall be deemed to refer to the most recent financial statements furnished pursuant to Sections 6.01(a) and 6.01(b)).  (b) No Default shall exist, or would result from such proposed Credit Extension or from the application of the proceeds thereof.  (c) The Administrative Agent and, if applicable, the L/C Issuer or the Swingline Lender shall have received a Request for Credit Extension in accordance with the requirements hereof. 
(d) In the case of a Credit Extension to be denominated in an Alternative Currency, there shall not have occurred any change in national
or international financial, political or economic conditions or currency exchange rates or exchange controls which in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent, the Required Lenders (in the case of any Loans to be denominated in an
Alternative Currency) or the L/C Issuer (in the case of any Letter of Credit to be denominated in an Alternative Currency) would make it impracticable for such Credit Extension to be denominated in the relevant Alternative Currency. 
Each Request for Credit Extension (other than a Loan Notice requesting only a conversion of Loans to the other Type or a continuation of Eurodollar Rate
Loans) submitted by the Borrower shall be deemed to be a representation and warranty that the conditions specified in Sections 4.02(a) and (b) have been satisfied on and as of the date of the applicable Credit Extension. 
ARTICLE V 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES  The Borrower represents and warrants to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders that:  Section 5.01 Organization.  (a) Each of the Borrower and the
Subsidiaries is duly organized and validly existing under the laws of its state of organization and has the power to own its assets and to transact the business in which it is presently engaged. 
(b) Each of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries is in good standing in its state of organization and in each state in which the character of
the properties owned or the business 
  81 



transacted requires qualification, except to the extent that the failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. 
Section 5.02 Power, Authority, Consents.  The Borrower has the power to execute, deliver and perform the Loan Documents to be executed by it. The Borrower has the power to request extensions of credit hereunder and has taken all necessary action,
corporate or otherwise, to authorize the extensions of credit hereunder on the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The Borrower has taken all necessary action, corporate or otherwise, to authorize the execution, delivery and performance of the
Loan Documents to be executed by it. No consent or approval of any Person (including, without limitation, any stockholder of the Borrower), no consent or approval of any landlord or mortgagee, no waiver of any Lien or right of distraint or other
similar right and no consent, license, certificate of need, approval, authorization or declaration of any governmental authority, bureau or agency, is or will be required in connection with the execution, delivery or performance by the Borrower of,
the extensions of credit under, or the validity or enforceability of, the Loan Documents, except as set forth on Schedule 5.02 hereto, each of which either has been duly and validly obtained on or prior to the date hereof and is now in full
force and effect, or is designated on Schedule 5.02 as waived by the Required Lenders.  Section 5.03 No
Violation of Law or Agreements.  The execution and delivery by the Borrower of each Loan Document to which it is a
party, the performance by it thereunder and the extensions of credit hereunder, will not violate any provision of law and will not conflict with or result in a breach of any order, writ, injunction, ordinance, resolution, decree, or other similar
document or instrument of any court or governmental authority, bureau or agency, domestic or foreign, or any certificate of incorporation or by-laws or other organizational document of the Borrower, or create (with or without the giving of notice or
lapse of time, or both) a default under or breach of any agreement, bond, note or indenture to which the Borrower is a party, or by which the Borrower is bound or any of its properties or assets is affected, except for such defaults and breaches
which in the aggregate could not have a Material Adverse Effect, or result in the imposition of any Lien of any nature wha

er from the Loans, and no Letter of Credit, will be used directly or indirectly for: (a) any purpose other than as set forth in Section 6.15, or
(b) the purpose of purchasing or carrying, or for payment in full or in part of Indebtedness that was incurred for the purposes of purchasing or carrying, any margin stock, as such term is defined in §221.3 of Regulation U of

Section 5.13 Name Changes, Mergers, Acquisitions. 
Except as set forth on Schedule 5.13 hereto, the Borrower has not within the six-year period immediately preceding the date of this
Agreement changed its name, been the surviving entity of a merger or consolidation, or, except in the ordinary course of business, acquired all or substantially all of the assets of any Person. 
Section 5.14 Full Disclosure.  Neither the Financial Statements nor any certificate, opinion, or any other statement made or furnished in writing to the Administrative Agent or any Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower in connection
with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein or pursuant hereto, contains any untrue statement of a material fact, or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements contained therein or herein not misleading,
as of the date such statement was made. There is no fact known to the Borrower that has, or would in the now foreseeable future have, a Material Adverse Effect, which fact has not been set forth herein, in the Financial Statements, in filings with
the Securities and Exchange Commission or in any certificate, opinion or other written statement so made or furnished to the Administrative Agent or the Lenders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to the Projections, the Borrower represents
only that such information was prepared in good faith based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable at the time (it being understood that actual results may differ materially from projections). 
Section 5.15 Licenses and Approvals.  (a) Each of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries has all necessary licenses, permits and governmental authorizations, including, without limitation, licenses, permits and authorizations arising under or
relating to Environmental Laws and Regulations, to own and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now conducted, the absence of which would have a Material Adverse Effect. 
(b) To the best of the Borrowers knowledge, no violation exists of any applicable law pertaining to the ownership or operation of
any Facility of the Borrower or any Operator that would have a reasonable likelihood of leading to revocation of any license necessary for the operation 

  Section 5.18 OFAC.  The Borrower is not located, organized or
residing in any Designated Jurisdiction. Neither the Borrower, nor, to the knowledge of the Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries, (a) is currently the subject of any Sanctions, or (b) is or has been (within the previous five (5) years)
engaged in any transaction with any Person who is now or was then the subject of Sanctions and who is located, organized or residing in any Designated Jurisdiction. To the knowledge of the Borrower, no Credit Extension, and none of the proceeds from
any Credit Extension, has been used, directly or indirectly: (1) to lend, contribute or provide or has otherwise been made available to fund any activity or business in any Designated Jurisdiction, (2) to fund any activity or business of
any Person located, organized or residing in any Designated Jurisdiction who is the subject of any Sanctions, or (3) in any other manner that will result, in each case, in any violation by any Person (including any Lender, any Arranger, the
Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or the Swingline Lender) of any Sanctions.  ARTICLE VI 
AFFIRMATIVE COVENANTS  The Borrower hereby covenants and agrees that on the Closing Date and thereafter until the Facility Termination Date, the Borrower shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to: 
Section 6.01 Financial Statements.  Deliver to the Administrative Agent and each Lender, in form and detail satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders: 
(a) Annual Financial Statements. Annually, as soon as available, but in any event within 90 days after the last day of each
of its fiscal years, a Consolidated balance sheet of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as at such last day of the fiscal year, and Consolidated statements of income and retained earnings and statements of cash flow, for such fiscal year, each

accounting firm satisfactory to the Administrative Agent as fairly presenting the financial position and results of operations of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as at and for the year ending on its date and as having been prepared in accordance
with GAAP; provided, however, the Borrower may satisfy its obligations to deliver the financial statements described in this Section 6.01(a) by furnishing to the Lenders a copy of its annual report on Form 10-K in respect of such fiscal
year together with the financial statements required to be attached thereto, provided the Borrower is required to file such annual report on Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission and such filing is actually made. 
  86 


(b) Quarterly Financial Statements. As soon as available, but in any event
within 45 days after the end of each of the Borrowers fiscal quarters, a Consolidated balance sheet of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries as of the last day of such quarter and Consolidated statements of income and retained earnings and
statements of cash flow, for such quarter, and on a comparative basis figures for the corresponding date or period of the immediately preceding fiscal year, all in reasonable detail, each such statement to be certified in a certificate of the chief
financial officer of the Borrower as accurately presenting the financial position and the results of operations of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as at its date and for such quarter and as having been prepared in accordance with GAAP (subject to
year-end audit adjustments); provided, however, the Borrower may satisfy its obligations to deliver the financial statements described in this Section 6.01(b) by furnishing to the Lenders a copy of its quarterly report on Form 10-Q in

whole, may be materially affected, and no event which, with the giving of notice or the lapse of time, or both, would constitute such an Event of Default or default, exists, or, if such cannot be so certified, specifying in reasonable detail the
exceptions, if any, to such statement. Such certificate shall be accompanied by a detailed calculation indicating compliance with the covenants contained in Sections 6.09, 7.01(f), 7.08(d), and 7.14 in the form annexed hereto as Exhibit

ARTICLE IX 
ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT  Section 9.01 Appointment and Authority.  Each of the Lenders

the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuer, and the Borrower shall not have rights as a third party beneficiary of any of such provisions. It is understood and agreed that the use of the term agent herein or
in any other Loan Documents (or any other similar term) with reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable Law. Instead such
term is used as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting parties.  Section 9.02 Rights as a Lender.  The Person serving as the
Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent and the term Lender or Lenders

to, own securities of, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust, financial, advisory, underwriting or other business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate

Lenders with respect thereto.  Section 9.03 Exculpatory Provisions.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent and its Related Parties:  (a) shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing;  (b) shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that
the Administrative Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents), provided that the
Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable Law, including for the
avoidance of doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any Debtor Relief Law or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any Debtor Relief Law; and
 (c) shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, have any duty or responsibility to
disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any
capacity.  Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its Related Parties shall be liable for any action taken or not taken
by the Administrative Agent under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or
percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary), or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Sections 10.01 and 8.02) or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence
or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment. Any such action taken or failure to act pursuant to the foregoing shall be binding on all Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed
not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until notice describing such Default is given in writing to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower, a Lender or the L/C Issuer. 
Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its Related Parties has any duty or obligation to any Lender or participant or any other
Person to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder
or 
  103




thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the
occurrence of any Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or the creation, perfection or priority of any Lien purported
to be created by any Loan Document, (v) the value or the sufficiency of any collateral, or (vi) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be
delivered to the Administrative Agent.  Section 9.04 Reliance by Administrative Agent. 
The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall be fully protected in relying and shall not incur any liability for
relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, communication, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and
to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall be fully
protected in relying and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, or the issuance, extension, renewal or increase of a Letter of Credit, that by its terms must
be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or the L/C Issuer, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender or the L/C Issuer unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from
such Lender or the L/C Issuer prior to the making of such Loan or the issuance of such Letter of Credit. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts
selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts. For purposes of determining compliance with the conditions specified in Section 4.01,
each Lender that has signed this Agreement shall be deemed to have consented to, approved or accepted or to be satisfied with, each document or other matter required thereunder to be consented to or approved by or acceptable or satisfactory to a
Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from such Lender prior to the proposed Closing Date specifying its objections.  Section 9.05 Delegation of Duties.  The Administrative Agent
may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may
perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent
and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the Facilities as well as activities as Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or
misconduct of any sub-agents except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and non-appealable judgment that the Administrative Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such
sub-agents.

Section 9.06 Resignation of Administrative Agent. 
(a) Notice. The Administrative Agent may at any time resign as Administrative Agent upon thirty (30) days notice to the
Lenders, the L/C Issuer and the Borrower. Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the Borrower (provided no such consultation shall be required if an Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing), to appoint a successor, which shall be a bank with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required
Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment prior to the effective date of the resignation that the Administrative Agent gives (the Resignation Effective Date), then the retiring Administrative Agent may (but shall not be
obligated to) on behalf of the Lenders and the L/C Issuer, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above; provided that if the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that no qualifying
Person has accepted such appointment, then such resignation shall nonetheless become effective.  (b) Effect of
Resignation. With effect from the Resignation Effective Date (i) the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (except that in the case of any collateral
security held by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders or the L/C Issuer under any of the Loan Documents, the retiring Administrative Agent shall continue to hold such collateral security until such time as a successor Administrative
Agent is appointed) and (ii) except for any indemnity payments or other amounts then owed to the retiring Administrative Agent, all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent
shall instead be made by or to each Lender and the L/C Issuer directly, until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided for above. Upon the acceptance of a successors appointment as
Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent (other than as provided in Section 3.01(g) and other than any rights to
indemnity payments or other amounts owed to the retiring Administrative Agent as of the Resignation Effective Date), and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan
Documents (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this Section). The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the
Borrower and such successor. After the retiring Administrative Agents resignation hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article and Section 10.04 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring
Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring Administrative Agent was acting as Administrative Agent. 
(c) L/C Issuer and Swingline Lender. Any resignation by KeyBank National Association as Administrative Agent pursuant to this
Section shall also constitute its resignation as L/C Issuer and Swingline Lender. If KeyBank National Association resigns as an L/C Issuer, it shall retain all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the L/C Issuer hereunder with respect to all
Letters of Credit outstanding as of the effective date of its resignation as L/C Issuer and all L/C Obligations with respect thereto, including the right to require the Lenders to make Base 
  105




Rate Loans or fund risk participations in Unreimbursed Amounts pursuant to Section 2.03(c). If KeyBank National Association resigns as Swingline Lender, it shall retain all the rights of the
Swingline Lender provided for hereunder with respect to Swingline Loans made by it and outstanding as of the effective date of such resignation, including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Loans or fund risk participations in
outstanding Swingline Loans pursuant to Section 2.04(c). Upon the appointment by the Borrower of a successor L/C Issuer or Swingline Lender hereunder (which successor shall in all cases be a Lender other than a Defaulting Lender), (i) such
successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring L/C Issuer or Swingline Lender, as applicable, (ii) the retiring L/C Issuer and Swingline Lender shall be discharged from all of
their respective duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents and (iii) the successor L/C Issuer shall issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession
or make other arrangements satisfactory to KeyBank National Association to effectively assume the obligations of KeyBank National Association with respect to such Letters of Credit. 
Section 9.07 Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Lenders. 
Each Lender, and the L/C Issuer, acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other
Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender and the L/C Issuer also acknowledges that it will,
independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in
taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.  Section 9.08 No Other Duties, Etc.  Anything herein to the
contrary notwithstanding, none of the Persons having any of the titles listed on the cover page hereof shall have any powers, duties or responsibilities under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, except in its capacity, as applicable,
as the Administrative Agent, an Arranger, a Lender or the L/C Issuer hereunder.  Section 9.09 Administrative Agent
May File Proofs of Claim.  In case of the pendency of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or any other judicial
proceeding relative to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan or L/C Obligation shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the
Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise:  (a) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans and L/C Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as
may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the 
  106




Lenders, the L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders, the L/C Issuer and the
Administrative Agent and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders, the L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.03(h) and (i), 2.09, and 10.04) allowed in such judicial proceeding; and
 (b) to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;
 and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby
authorized by each Lender and the L/C Issuer to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders and the L/C Issuer, to pay to the
Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.09 and 10.04.
 Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt
on behalf of any Lender or the L/C Issuer any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the rights of any Lender or the L/C Issuer or to authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender
or the L/C Issuer or in any such proceeding.  ARTICLE X 
MISCELLANEOUS  Section 10.01 Amendments, Etc.  No amendment or waiver of any
provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, and no consent to any departure by the Borrower therefrom, shall be effective unless in writing signed by the Required Lenders and the Borrower and acknowledged by the Administrative Agent, and
each such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given; provided, however, that no such amendment, waiver or consent shall: 
(a) extend or increase the Commitment of any Lender (or reinstate any Commitment terminated pursuant to Section 8.02) without the
written consent of such Lender (it being understood and agreed that a waiver of any condition precedent in Section 4.02 or of any Default or a mandatory reduction in Commitments is not considered an extension or increase in Commitments of any
Lender);  (b) postpone any date fixed by this Agreement or any other Loan Document for any payment (excluding mandatory
prepayments) of principal, interest, fees or other amounts due to the Lenders (or any of them) hereunder or under such other Loan Document without the written consent of each Lender entitled to such payment; 
  107



(c) reduce the principal of, or the rate of interest specified herein on, any Loan or L/C
Borrowing, or (subject to clause (iv) of the second proviso to this Section 10.01) any fees or other amounts payable hereunder or under any other Loan Document or change the form or currency of payment, without the written consent of each
Lender entitled to such amount or directly affected thereby; provided, however, that only the consent of the Required Lenders shall be necessary (i) to amend the definition of Default Rate or to waive any obligation of
the Borrower to pay interest or Letter of Credit Fees at the Default Rate or (ii) to amend any financial covenant hereunder (or any defined term used therein) even if the effect of such amendment would be to reduce the rate of interest on any
Loan or L/C Borrowing or to reduce any fee payable hereunder;  (d) change Section 8.03 or Section 2.13 in a manner that
would alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby without the written consent of each Lender;  (e) change any
provision of this Section 10.01 or the definition of Required Lenders or any other provision of any Loan Document specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to amend, waive or otherwise modify any rights hereunder or
thereunder or make any determination or grant any consent hereunder or thereunder, without the written consent of each Lender; 
(f) release the Borrower or permit the Borrower to assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or the other
Loan Documents without the written consent of each Lender; or  (g) impose any greater restriction on the ability of any Lender
under a Facility to assign any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the written consent of the Required Lenders under such Facility; 
and provided, further, that (i) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by the L/C Issuer in addition to
the Lenders required above, affect the rights or duties of the L/C Issuer under this Agreement or any Issuer Document relating to any Letter of Credit issued or to be issued by it; (ii) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing
and signed by the Swingline Lender in addition to the Lenders required above, affect the rights or duties of the Swingline Lender under this Agreement; (iii) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by the
Administrative Agent in addition to the Lenders required above, affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent under this Agreement or any other Loan Document; and (iv) any fee letter may be amended, or rights or privileges thereunder
waived, in a writing executed only by the parties thereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (A) no Defaulting Lender shall have any right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent hereunder (and any amendment,
waiver or consent which by its terms requires the consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender, or all Lenders or each affected Lender under a Facility, may be effected with the consent of the applicable Lenders other than Defaulting Lenders),
except that (1) the Commitment of any Defaulting Lender may not be increased or extended without the consent of such Lender and (2) any waiver, amendment or modification requiring the consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender, or all
Lenders or each affected Lender under a Facility, that by its terms affects any Defaulting Lender disproportionately adversely relative to other affected Lenders shall require the consent of such

  108




Defaulting Lender; (B) each Lender is entitled to vote as such Lender sees fit on any bankruptcy reorganization plan that affects the Loans, and each Lender acknowledges that the provisions
of Section 1126(c) of the Bankruptcy Code of the United States supersedes the unanimous consent provisions set forth herein and (C) the Required Lenders shall determine whether or not to allow the Borrower to use Cash Collateral in the
context of a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding and such determination shall be binding on all of the Lenders.  Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein the Administrative Agent may, with notice to the Lenders and the prior written consent of the Borrower only, amend, modify or supplement this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents to cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake,
defect or inconsistency.  If any Lender does not consent to a proposed amendment, waiver, consent or release with respect to any Loan Document
that requires the consent of each Lender and that has been approved by the Required Lenders, the Borrower may replace such Non-Consenting Lender in accordance with Section 10.13; provided that such amendment, waiver, consent or release
can be effected as a result of the assignment contemplated by such Section (together with all other such assignments required by the Borrower to be made pursuant to this paragraph).

clauses (i) and (ii), if such notice, email or other communication is not sent during the normal business hours of the recipient, such notice, email or communication shall be deemed to have been sent at the opening of business on the next
Business Day for the recipient.  (c) The Platform. THE PLATFORM IS PROVIDED AS IS AND AS

WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS OR FREEDOM FROM VIRUSES OR OTHER CODE DEFECTS, IS MADE BY ANY AGENT PARTY IN
CONNECTION WITH THE BORROWER MATERIALS OR THE PLATFORM. In no event shall the Administrative Agent or any of its Related Parties (collectively, the Agent Parties) have any liability to the Borrower, any Lender, the L/C Issuer or

entitled to rely and act upon any notices (including telephonic or electronic Loan Notices, Letter of Credit Applications and Swingline Loan Notices) purportedly given by or on behalf of the Borrower even if (i) such notices were not made in a
manner specified herein, were incomplete or were not preceded or followed by any other form of notice specified herein, or (ii) the terms thereof, as understood by the recipient, varied from any confirmation thereof. The Borrower shall
indemnify the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer, each Lender and the Related Parties of each of them from all losses, costs, expenses and liabilities resulting from the reliance by such Person on each notice purportedly given by or on behalf of

No failure by any Lender, the L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent to exercise, and no delay by any such Person in exercising, any
right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder or under any other Loan Document preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. The rights, remedies, powers and privileges herein provided, and provided under each other Loan Document, are cumulative and not exclusive of any
rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided by law.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any
other Loan Document, the authority to enforce rights and remedies hereunder and under the other Loan Documents against the Borrower shall be vested exclusively in, and all actions and proceedings at law in connection with such enforcement shall be
instituted and maintained exclusively by, the Administrative Agent in accordance with Section 8.02 for the benefit of all the Lenders and the L/C Issuer; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not prohibit (a) the

from exercising the rights and remedies that inure to its benefit (solely in its capacity as L/C Issuer or Swingline Lender, as the case may be) hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, (c) any Lender from exercising setoff rights in
accordance with Section 10.08 (subject to the terms of Section 2.13), or (d) any Lender from filing proofs of

claim or appearing and filing pleadings on its own behalf during the pendency of a proceeding relative to the Borrower under any Debtor Relief Law; and provided, further, that if at
any time there is no Person acting as Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, then (i) the Required Lenders shall have the rights otherwise ascribed to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 8.02 and
(ii) in addition to the matters set forth in clauses (b), (c) and (d) of the preceding proviso and subject to Section 2.13, any Lender may, with the consent of the Required Lenders, enforce any rights and remedies available to it

Indemnitee) against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses (including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee), incurred by any
Indemnitee or asserted against any Indemnitee by any Person (including the Borrower) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument
contemplated hereby or thereby, the performance by the parties hereto of their respective obligations hereunder or thereunder or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or, in the case of the Administrative Agent (and

prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory, whether brought by a third party or by the
Borrower or any of the Borrowers directors, shareholders or creditors, and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto; provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such
losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee. Without limiting
the provisions of Section 3.01(c), this Section 10.04(b) shall not apply with respect to Taxes other than any Taxes that represent losses, claims, damages, etc. arising from any non-Tax claim.

Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent), the L/C Issuer, the Swingline Lender or such Related Party, as the case may be, such Lenders pro rata share (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment
is sought based on each Lenders share of the Total Credit Exposure at such time) of such unpaid amount (including any such unpaid amount in respect of a claim asserted by such Lender), such payment to be made severally among them based on such
Lenders Applicable Percentage (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought), provided, further that, the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or
related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent), the L/C Issuer or the Swingline Lender in its capacity as such, or against any Related Party of any of the foregoing acting
for the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent), the L/C Issuer or the Swingline Lender in connection with such capacity. The obligations of the Lenders under this subsection (c) are subject to the provisions of Section 2.12(d).
 (d) Waiver of Consequential Damages, Etc. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the Borrower shall not
assert, and the Borrower hereby waives, and acknowledges that no other Person shall have, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages)
arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the
proceeds thereof. No Indemnitee referred to in subsection (b) above shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by unintended recipients of any information or other materials distributed to such unintended recipients by such Indemnitee
through telecommunications, electronic or other information transmission systems in connection with this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

survive the resignation of the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and the 
  113




Swingline Lender, the replacement of any Lender, the termination of the Aggregate Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all the other Obligations. 
Section 10.05 Payments Set Aside.  To the extent that any payment by or on behalf of the Borrower is made to the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or any Lender, or the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or any Lender exercises its
right of setoff, and such payment or the proceeds of such setoff or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the
Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or such Lender in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or otherwise, then (a) to the extent of such recovery,
the obligation or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such setoff had not occurred and (b) each Lender and the L/C Issuer severally
agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent upon demand its applicable share (without duplication) of any amount so recovered from or repaid by the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such payment is
made at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect, in the applicable currency of such recovery or payment. The obligations of the Lenders and the L/C Issuer under clause (b) of the preceding sentence shall
survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.  Section 10.06 Successors and
Assigns.  (a) Successors and Assigns Generally. The provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and thereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder

Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.  (b) Assignments by Lenders. Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (including
all or a portion of its Commitment(s) and the Loans (including for purposes of this subsection (b), participations in L/C Obligations and in Swingline Loans) at the time owing to it); provided that (in each case with respect to any Facility)
any such assignment shall be subject to the following conditions: 
  114



(i) Minimum Amounts. 
(A) in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lenders Commitment under any Facility and/or the
Loans at the time owing to it (in each case with respect to any Facility) or contemporaneous assignments to related Approved Funds that equal at least the amount specified in paragraph (b)(i)(B) of this Section in the aggregate or in the case of an
assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund, no minimum amount need be assigned; and  (B) in any
case not described in subsection (b)(i)(A) of this Section, the aggregate amount of the Commitment (which for this purpose includes Loans outstanding thereunder) or, if the Commitment is not then in effect, the principal outstanding balance of the
Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment, determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if Trade Date is specified in the
Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade Date, shall not be less than $5,000,000, in the case of any assignment in respect of the Revolving Facility or the Term Facility, unless each of the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Event of Default
has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower otherwise consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).  (ii) Proportionate Amounts. Each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents with respect to the Loans and/or the Commitment assigned, except that this clause (ii) shall not apply to the Swingline Lenders rights and obligations in respect of Swingline Loans. 
(iii) Required Consents. No consent shall be required for any assignment except to the extent required by subsection (b)(i)(B) of
this Section and, in addition:  (A) the consent of the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed)
shall be required unless (1) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of such assignment or (2) such assignment is to an Affiliate of the assigning Lender or an Approved Fund of the assigning Lender; provided
that the Borrower shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment unless it shall object thereto by written notice to the Administrative Agent within five (5) Business Days after having received notice thereof; and provided,
further, that the Borrowers consent shall not be required during the primary syndication of the Facilities;  (B)
the consent of the Administrative Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required for assignments in respect of (1) any unfunded Term Commitment or any Revolving Commitment if such assignment is to a Person
that is not a Lender with a Commitment in respect of the applicable Facility, an Affiliate of such Lender or an Approved Fund with respect to such Lender or (2) any Term Loan to a Person that is not a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an
Approved Fund of a Lender; and  (C) the consent of the L/C Issuer and the Swingline Lender shall be required for any
assignment in respect of the a Revolving Commitment. 
  115



(iv) Assignment and Assumption. The parties to each assignment shall execute and
deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee in the amount of $3,500; provided, however, that the Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, elect to waive such
processing and recordation fee in the case of any assignment. The assignee, if it is not a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire.  (v) No Assignment to Certain Persons. No such assignment shall be made to (A) the Borrower or any of the Borrowers Affiliates or Subsidiaries, (B) any Defaulting Lender or any of
its Subsidiaries, or any Person who, upon becoming a Lender hereunder, would constitute any of the foregoing Persons described in this clause (B), or (C) a natural Person. 
(vi) Certain Additional Payments. In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder,
no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments to the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient,
upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with the consent of the Borrower and the Administrative
Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Loans previously requested but not funded by such Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (A) pay and satisfy in full all payment
liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or any Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon) and (B) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro rata share of all Loans and participations
in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans in accordance with its Applicable Percentage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under
applicable Law without compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs. 
Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection (c) of this Section, from and after the effective
date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this
Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of
the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04, 3.05 and 10.04 with respect to facts and circumstances
occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment); provided, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no assignment by a Defaulting Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any
party hereunder arising from that Lenders having been a Defaulting Lender. Upon request, the Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and deliver a Note to the assignee Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations
under this Agreement that does not comply with this subsection shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such 
  116




Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with subsection (d) of this Section.  (c) Register. The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower (and such agency being solely for tax purposes), shall maintain at the Administrative Agents
Office a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it (or the equivalent thereof in electronic form) and a register in which it shall record the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts (and stated
interest) of the Loans and L/C Obligations owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the Register). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower
and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.  (d) Participations. Any
Lender may at any time, without the consent of, but with notice to, the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural Person, a Defaulting Lender or the Borrower or any of the Borrowers
Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a Participant) in all or a portion of such Lenders rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitments and/or the Loans (including such
Lenders participations in L/C Obligations and/or Swingline Loans) owing to it); provided that (i) such Lenders obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to
the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuer shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lenders
rights and obligations under this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, each Lender shall be responsible for the indemnity under Section 10.04(c) without regard to the existence of any participations. 
Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole
right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of a Participant, agree to
any amendment, waiver or other modification described in the first proviso to Section 10.01 that affects such Participant. The Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04 and 3.05 to the same
extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section (it being understood that the documentation required under Section 3.01(e) shall be delivered to the Lender who sells the
participation) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section; provided that such Participant (A) agrees to be subject to the provisions of Sections
3.06 and 10.13 as if it were an assignee under paragraph (b) of this Section and (B) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 3.01 or 3.04, with respect to any participation, than the Lender from whom it acquired
the applicable participation would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation. Each Lender
that sells a participation agrees, at the Borrowers request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrower to 
  117




effectuate the provisions of Section 3.06 with respect to any Participant. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.08 as
though it were a Lender; provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.13 as though it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, maintain a
register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participants interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the Participant
Register); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participants interest in any
commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in
registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the
Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no
responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.  (e) Certain Pledges. Any Lender may at any time pledge or
assign, or grant a security interest in, all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including under its Note or Notes, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment, or grant of a security interest, to
secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment, or grant of a security interest, shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee or grantee
for such Lender as a party hereto.  (f) Resignation as L/C Issuer or Swingline Lender after Assignment. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, if at any time KeyBank National Association assigns all of its Revolving Commitment and Revolving Loans pursuant to subsection (b) above, KeyBank National Association may, (i) upon thirty
(30) days notice to the Borrower and the Lenders, resign as L/C Issuer and/or (ii) upon thirty (30) days notice to the Borrower, resign as Swingline Lender. In the event of any such resignation as L/C Issuer or Swingline
Lender, the Borrower shall be entitled to appoint from among the Lenders a successor L/C Issuer or Swingline Lender hereunder; provided, however, that no failure by the Borrower to appoint any such successor shall affect the
resignation of KeyBank National Association as L/C Issuer or Swingline Lender, as the case may be. If KeyBank National Association resigns as L/C Issuer, it shall retain all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the L/C Issuer hereunder with
respect to all Letters of Credit outstanding as of the effective date of its resignation as L/C Issuer and all L/C Obligations with respect thereto (including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Loans or fund risk participations in
Unreimbursed Amounts pursuant to Section 2.03(c)). If KeyBank National Association resigns as Swingline Lender, it shall retain all the rights of the Swingline Lender provided for hereunder with respect to Swingline Loans made by it and
outstanding as of the effective date of such resignation, including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Loans or fund risk participations in outstanding Swingline Loans pursuant to Section 2.04(c). Upon the appointment of a
successor L/C Issuer and/or Swingline Lender, (A) such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, 
  118




privileges and duties of the retiring L/C Issuer or Swingline Lender, as the case may be and (B) the successor L/C Issuer shall issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of
Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession or make other arrangements satisfactory to KeyBank National Association to effectively assume the obligations of KeyBank National Association with respect to such Letters of Credit whereupon
such substitute letters of credit or other arrangements shall be deemed to be, and the Letters of Credit issued by the retiring L/C Issuer shall cease to be, Letters of Credit hereunder. 
Section 10.07 Treatment of Certain Information; Confidentiality. 
(a) Treatment of Certain Information. Each of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuer agrees to maintain the
confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (i) to its Related Parties (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such
Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (ii) to the extent required or requested by any regulatory authority purporting to have jurisdiction over such Person or its Related Parties (including any self-regulatory
authority, such as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners), (iii) to the extent required by applicable Laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (iv) to any other party hereto, (v) in connection
with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or under any other Loan Document or any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, (vi) subject to an agreement
containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section, to (A) any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights and obligations under this Agreement or any Eligible Assignee
invited to be a Lender pursuant to Section 2.16 or 2.17 or (B) any actual or prospective party (or its Related Parties) to any swap, derivative or other transaction under which payments are to be made by reference to the Borrower and its
obligations, this Agreement or payments hereunder, (vii) on a confidential basis to (A) any rating agency in connection with rating the Borrower or its Subsidiaries or the credit facilities provided hereunder or (B) the CUSIP Service
Bureau or any similar agency in connection with the issuance and monitoring of CUSIP numbers or other market identifiers with respect to the credit facilities provided hereunder, (viii) with the consent of the Borrower or to the extent such
Information (1) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section or (2) becomes available to the Administrative Agent, any Lender, the L/C Issuer or any of their respective Affiliates on a nonconfidential basis
from a source other than the Borrower. For purposes of this Section, Information means all information received from the Borrower or any Subsidiary relating to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or any of their respective businesses, other
than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the Borrower or any Subsidiary, provided that, in the case of information received from
the Borrower or any Subsidiary after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered
to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information. 
  119



(b) Non-Public Information. Each of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the L/C
Issuer acknowledges that (i) the Information may include material non-public information concerning the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, (ii) it has developed compliance procedures regarding the use of material
non-public information and (iii) it will handle such material non-public information in accordance with applicable Law, including United States federal and state securities Laws. 
(c) Press Releases. The Borrower and its Affiliates agree that they will not in the future issue any press releases using the name
of the Administrative Agent or any Lender or their respective Affiliates or referring to this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, not to be unreasonably withheld,
unless (and only to the extent that) the Borrower or such Affiliate is required to do so under law and then, in any event the Borrower or such Affiliate will consult with such Person before issuing such press release. 
(d) Customary Advertising Material. The Administrative Agent and the Lenders agree that they will not use the name, product
photographs, logo or trademark of the Borrower for any advertising material relating to the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior written consent of the Borrower, not to be unreasonably withheld. 
Section 10.08 Right of Setoff.  If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender, the L/C Issuer and each of their respective Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, in whatever currency) at any time held and other obligations (in whatever currency) at any time owing by such
Lender, the L/C Issuer or any such Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower against any and all of the obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Agreement or any other Loan Document to such Lender or the
L/C Issuer or their respective Affiliates, irrespective of whether or not such Lender, the L/C Issuer or Affiliate shall have made any demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and although such obligations of the Borrower may be
contingent or unmatured, secured or unsecured, or are owed to a branch, office or Affiliate of such Lender or the L/C Issuer different from the branch, office or Affiliate holding such deposit or obligated on such indebtedness; provided that
in the event that any Defaulting Lender shall exercise any such right of setoff, all amounts so set off shall be paid over immediately to the Administrative Agent for further application in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.15 and,
pending such payment, shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and the Lenders. The rights of each Lender, the L/C Issuer and their
respective Affiliates under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that such Lender, the L/C Issuer or their respective Affiliates may have. Each Lender and the L/C Issuer agrees to notify the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent promptly after any such setoff and application, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application. 
  120



Section 10.09 Interest Rate Limitation. 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid under the Loan Documents
shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious interest permitted by applicable Law (the Maximum Rate). If the Administrative Agent or any Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess
interest shall be applied to the principal of the Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the Borrower. In determining whether the interest contracted for, charged, or received by the Administrative Agent or a Lender exceeds the
Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof and
(c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the Obligations hereunder.  Section 10.10 Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness.  This
Agreement and each of the other Loan Documents may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto in different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original. This Agreement, the other Loan Documents, and any separate letter
agreements with respect to fees payable to the Administrative Agent or the L/C Issuer, constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or
written, relating to the subject matter hereof. Except as provided in Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received
counterparts hereof that, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or any certificate delivered thereunder, by
fax transmission or other electronic mail transmission (e.g. pdf or tif) shall be effective as delivery of an originally executed counterpart of this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, to the extent an originally
executed counterpart is not specifically required to be delivered under the terms of any Loan Document, upon the request of any party, such fax transmission or electronic mail transmission shall be promptly followed by such originally executed
counterpart.  Section 10.11 Survival of Representations and Warranties. 
All representations and warranties made hereunder and in any other Loan Document or other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or
in connection herewith or therewith shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and thereof. Such representations and warranties have been or will be relied upon by the Administrative Agent and each Lender, regardless of any investigation made
by the Administrative Agent or any Lender or on their behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default at the time of any Credit Extension, and shall continue in full force and
effect as long as any Loan or any other Obligation hereunder shall remain unpaid or unsatisfied or any Letter of Credit shall remain outstanding. 
  121



Section 10.12 Severability. 
If any provision of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, (a) the legality,
validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall not be affected or impaired thereby and (b) the parties shall endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the illegal, invalid or
unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions. The invalidity of a provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate or
render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this Section, if and to the extent that the enforceability of any provisions in this Agreement relating to Defaulting Lenders shall be
limited by Debtor Relief Laws, as determined in good faith by the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or the Swingline Lender, as applicable, then such provisions shall be deemed to be in effect only to the extent not so limited. 
Section 10.13 Replacement of Lenders.  If the Borrower is entitled to replace a Lender pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.06, or if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender or a Non-Consenting Lender or if any other circumstance exists
hereunder that gives the Borrower the right to replace a Lender as a party hereto, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without
recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 10.06), all of its interests, rights (other than its existing rights to payments pursuant to Sections 3.01 and 3.04) and
obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an Eligible Assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment), provided that: 
(a) the Borrower shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the assignment fee (if any) specified in Section 10.06(b); 
(b) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to 100% of the outstanding principal of its Loans and L/C Advances, accrued
interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under Section 3.05) from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and
fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts);  (c) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for
compensation under Section 3.04 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 3.01, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter; 
(d) such assignment does not conflict with applicable Laws; and  (e) in the case of an assignment resulting from a Lender becoming a Non-Consenting Lender, the applicable assignee shall have consented to the applicable amendment, waiver or consent. 
  122



A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto,
as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.  Section 10.14 Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Etc.  (a)

Agreement provided by the Administrative Agent and any Affiliate thereof, the Arrangers and the Lenders are arms-length commercial transactions between the Borrower and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent and, as
applicable, its Affiliates and the Lenders and their Affiliates (collectively, solely for purposes of this Section, the Lenders), on the other hand, (ii) the Borrower has consulted its own legal, accounting, regulatory and
tax advisors to the extent it has deemed appropriate and (iii) the Borrower is capable of evaluating, and understands and accepts, the terms, risks and conditions of the transactions contemplated hereby and by the other Loan Documents;
(b) (i) the Administrative Agent and its Affiliates and each Lender each is and has been acting solely as a principal and, except as expressly agreed in writing by the relevant parties, has not been, is not, and will not be acting as an
advisor, agent or fiduciary, for Borrower or any of its Affiliates, or any other Person and (ii) neither the Administrative Agent, any of its Affiliates nor any Lender has any obligation to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates with respect to

The words execute, execution, signed, signature, and words of like import in any
Assignment and Assumption or in any amendment or other modification hereof (including waivers and consents) shall be deemed to include electronic signatures, the electronic matching of assignment terms and contract formations on electronic platforms
approved by the Administrative Agent, or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the
case may be, to the extent and as provided for in any applicable Law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act, or any other similar state laws based on
the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act.  Section 10.18 Automatic Alternative Currency Conversion.
 If an Automatic Alternative Currency Conversion Trigger shall occur, the Outstanding Amount of all Revolving Loans
denominated in an Alternative Currency and the Outstanding Amount of all Letters of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency shall, automatically and with no further action required, be converted into the Dollar Equivalent of such amounts,
determined by the Administrative Agent or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, on the basis of the Spot Rate determined on the Automatic Alternative Currency Conversion Date, and on and after such date all amounts accruing and owed to the Lenders in
respect of the Outstanding Amount of such Revolving Loans and such Letters of Credit shall accrue and be payable in Dollars at the rate otherwise applicable hereunder.  Section 10.19 Judgment Currency.  If, for the purposes of
obtaining judgment in any court, it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder or under any other Loan Document in one currency into another currency, the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the
Administrative Agent could purchase the first currency with such other currency on the Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is given. The obligation of the Borrower in respect of any such sum due from it to the Administrative Agent,
the L/C Issuer or any Lender hereunder or under the other Loan Documents shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency (the Judgment Currency) other than that in which such sum is denominated in accordance with the applicable
provisions of this Agreement (the Agreement Currency), be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, of any sum adjudged to be so due in
the Judgment Currency, the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase the Agreement Currency with the Judgment Currency. If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is
less than the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent or any 
  125




Lender from the Borrower in the Agreement Currency, the Borrower agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or
such Lender, as the case may be, against such loss. If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is greater than the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or such Lender in such currency, the Administrative Agent,
the L/C Issuer or such Lender, as the case may be, agrees to return the amount of any excess to the Borrower (or to any other Person who may be entitled thereto under applicable Law). All of the Borrowers obligations under this
Section 10.19 shall survive termination of the Aggregate Commitments and repayment of all other Obligations hereunder. 
Section 10.20 USA PATRIOT Act Notice.  Each Lender that is subject to the Act (as hereinafter defined) and the Administrative Agent (for itself and not on behalf of any Lender) hereby notifies the Borrower that pursuant to the requirements of
the USA PATRIOT Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)) (the Act), it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Borrower, which information includes the name and
address of the Borrower and other information that will allow such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, to identify the Borrower in accordance with the Act. The Borrower agrees to, promptly following a request by the Administrative
Agent or any Lender, provide all such other documentation and information that the Administrative Agent or such Lender requests in order to comply with its ongoing obligations under applicable know your customer and anti-money laundering
rules and regulations, including the Act.  Section 10.21 Termination of Existing Loan Agreement.
 On the Closing Date, the Existing Loan Agreement is hereby terminated except for such provisions, if any, that are
specified in the Existing Loan Agreement as surviving the termination thereof, which provisions shall as so specified, survive and remain in full force and effect.  [REMAINDER OF PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK.]

(a) in order to accommodate the foregoing request, the Lenders are making funding arrangements for value on the Effective Date, (b) there can be no assurance that the Credit Agreement will become effective as of the Effective Date,
(c) the Lenders will not make Effective Date Eurodollar Rate Loans unless the Credit Agreement has been fully executed and the requirements set forth in Article IV of the Credit Agreement are satisfied (the Funding
Requirements), and (d) if the Funding Requirements are not satisfied on or before the Effective Date, the Lenders may sustain funding losses as a result of such failure to close on such date. 
In order to induce the Lenders to make the funding arrangements necessary to make the Effective Date Eurodollar Rate Loans on the
Effective Date, the Borrower agrees promptly upon demand to compensate each Lender and hold each Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense (including the cost of counsel) which such Lender may incur (a) as a consequence of any failure to
(i) satisfy the Funding Requirements or (ii) borrow the Effective Date Eurodollar Rate Loans on the Effective Date from such Lender for any reason whatsoever (including the failure of the Credit Agreement to become effective) or
(b) in connection with the preparation, administration or enforcement of, or any dispute arising under, this Funding Indemnity Letter. For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to any Lender under this paragraph, the
provisions of Section 3.05 of the Credit Agreement shall apply as if the Credit Agreement were in effect with respect to the Effective Date Eurodollar Rate Loans (regardless of whether the Credit Agreement ever becomes effective). 


This letter agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, which together shall
constitute one instrument. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this letter agreement by fax transmission or other electronic mail transmission (e.g. pdf or tif) shall be effective as delivery of a
manually executed counterpart of this letter agreement. This letter agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the law of the State of New York.  [REMAINDER OF PAGE LEFT INTENTIONALLY BLANK]

SCHEDULE 1.01(c) 
EXISTING LETTERS OF CREDIT  None. 


SCHEDULE 1.01(d) 
MANDATORY COST  1. The Mandatory Cost (to the extent applicable) is an addition to the interest rate to compensate Lenders for the cost of compliance with: 
 


 
(a)
the requirements of the Bank of England and/or the Financial Services Authority (or, in either case, any other authority which replaces all or any of its functions); or
  


 
(b)
the requirements of the European Central Bank.  2. On the first day of each Interest Period (or as soon as possible thereafter) the Administrative Agent shall calculate, as a percentage rate, a rate (the Additional Cost Rate) for
each Lender, in accordance with the paragraphs set out below. The Mandatory Cost will be calculated by the Administrative Agent as a weighted average of the Lenders Additional Cost Rates (weighted in proportion to the percentage participation
of each Lender in the relevant Loan) and will be expressed as a percentage rate per annum. The Administrative Agent will, at the request of the Borrower or any Lender, deliver to the Borrower or such Lender as the case may be, a statement setting
forth the calculation of any Mandatory Cost.  3. The Additional Cost Rate for any Lender lending from a Lending Office in a
Participating Member State will be the percentage notified by that Lender to the Administrative Agent. This percentage will be certified by such Lender in its notice to the Administrative Agent to be its reasonable determination of the cost
(expressed as a percentage of such Lenders participation in all Loans made from such Lending Office) of complying with the minimum reserve requirements of the European Central Bank in respect of Loans made from that Lending Office. 
4. The Additional Cost Rate for any Lender lending from a Lending Office in the United Kingdom will be calculated by the Administrative
Agent as follows:   


 
(a)
in relation to any Loan in Sterling:   











 
AB+C(B-D)+E × 0.01
 
per cent per annum
  



 
100 - (A+C)
 

  

  


 
(b)
in relation to any Loan in any currency other than Sterling:   











 
        E × 0.01        
 
per cent per annum
  



 
300
 

  

 Where:   


 
A
is the percentage of Eligible Liabilities (assuming these to be in excess of any stated minimum) which that Lender is from time to time required to maintain as an
interest free cash ratio deposit with the Bank of England to comply with cash ratio requirements. 


SCHEDULE 1.01(d)   


 
B
is the percentage rate of interest (excluding the Applicable Rate, the Mandatory Cost and any interest charged on overdue amounts pursuant to the first sentence of
Section 2.08(b) and, in the case of interest (other than on overdue amounts) charged at the Default Rate, without counting any increase in interest rate effected by the charging of the Default Rate) payable for the relevant Interest
Period of such Loan.   


 
C
is the percentage (if any) of Eligible Liabilities which such Lender is required from time to time to maintain as interest bearing Special Deposits with the Bank of
England.   


 
D
is the percentage rate per annum payable by the Bank of England to the Administrative Agent on interest bearing Special Deposits. 
 


 
E
is designed to compensate Lenders for amounts payable under the Fees Rules and is calculated by the Administrative Agent as being the average of the most recent rates
of charge supplied by the Lenders to the Administrative Agent pursuant to paragraph 7 below and expressed in pounds per £1,000,000.  5. For the purposes of this Schedule:   


 
(a)
Eligible Liabilities and Special Deposits have the meanings given to them from time to time under or pursuant to the Bank of
England Act 1998 or (as may be appropriate) by the Bank of England;   


 
(b)
Fees Rules means the rules on periodic fees contained in the FSA Supervision Manual or such other law or regulation as may be in force from time to
time in respect of the payment of fees for the acceptance of deposits;   


 
(c)
Fee Tariffs means the fee tariffs specified in the Fees Rules under the activity group A.1 Deposit acceptors (ignoring any minimum fee or zero rated
fee required pursuant to the Fees Rules but taking into account any applicable discount rate); and   


 
(d)
Tariff Base has the meaning given to it in, and will be calculated in accordance with, the Fees Rules. 
6. In application of the above formulae, A, B, C and D will be included in the formulae as percentages (i.e. 5% will be included in the
formula as 5 and not as 0.05). A negative result obtained by subtracting D from B shall be taken as zero. The resulting figures shall be rounded to four decimal places. 


SCHEDULE 1.01(d)   
7. If requested by the Administrative Agent or the Borrower, each Lender with a Lending
Office in the United Kingdom or a Participating Member State shall, as soon as practicable after publication by the Financial Services Authority, supply to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, the rate of charge payable by such Lender to the
Financial Services Authority pursuant to the Fees Rules in respect of the relevant financial year of the Financial Services Authority (calculated for this purpose by such Lender as being the average of the Fee Tariffs applicable to such Lender for
that financial year) and expressed in pounds per £1,000,000 of the Tariff Base of such Lender.  8. Each Lender shall
supply any information required by the Administrative Agent for the purpose of calculating its Additional Cost Rate. In particular, but without limitation, each Lender shall supply the following information in writing on or prior to the date on
which it becomes a Lender:   


 
(a)
the jurisdiction of the Lending Office out of which it is making available its participation in the relevant Loan; and 
 


 
(b)
any other information that the Administrative Agent may reasonably require for such purpose.  Each Lender shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent in writing of any change to the information provided by it pursuant to this paragraph. 
9. The percentages of each Lender for the purpose of A and C above and the rates of charge of each Lender for the purpose of E above
shall be determined by the Administrative Agent based upon the information supplied to it pursuant to paragraphs 7 and 8 above and on the assumption that, unless a Lender notifies the Administrative Agent to the contrary, each
Lenders obligations in relation to cash ratio deposits and Special Deposits are the same as those of a typical bank from its jurisdiction of incorporation with a Lending Office in the same jurisdiction as its Lending Office. 
10. The Administrative Agent shall have no liability to any Person if such determination results in an Additional Cost Rate which over-
or under-compensates any Lender and shall be entitled to assume that the information provided by any Lender pursuant to paragraphs 3, 7 and 8 above is true and correct in all respects. 
11. The Administrative Agent shall distribute the additional amounts received as a result of the Mandatory Cost to the Lenders on the
basis of the Additional Cost Rate for each Lender based on the information provided by each Lender pursuant to paragraphs 3, 7 and 8 above.  12. Any determination by the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Schedule in relation to a formula, the Mandatory Cost, an Additional Cost Rate or any amount payable to a Lender shall, in the absence of
manifest error, be conclusive and binding on all parties hereto.  13. The Administrative Agent may from time to time, after
consultation with the Borrower and the Lenders, reasonably and in good faith, determine and notify to all parties any 


SCHEDULE 1.01(d)   

amendments which are required to be made to this Schedule in order to comply with any change in law, regulation or any requirements from time to time imposed by the Bank of England, the Financial
Services Authority or the European Central Bank (or, in any case, any other authority which replaces all or any of its functions) and any such determination shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding on all parties hereto.
 14. The Borrower shall be required to pay any Mandatory Cost calculated in accordance with this Schedule only to the extent
that the Administrative Agent or the applicable Lender generally imposes such Mandatory Cost on other borrowers of such Lender in similar circumstances.
