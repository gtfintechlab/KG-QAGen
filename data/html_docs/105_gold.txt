FOR VALUE RECEIVED,
the undersigned, Cinedigm Corp. (the “Borrower”), hereby promises to pay to the each of Bison Entertainment

amount of all Loan (as defined in the Loan Agreement referred to below) of the Lender to the Borrower, payable at such times and
in such amounts as are specified in the Loan Agreement.
 
The Borrower promises
to pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of the Loan from the date made until such principal amount is paid in full, payable
at such times and at the interest rate set forth in Section 2.7 of the Loan Agreement. Demand, diligence, presentment, protest

Both principal
and interest are payable in Dollars to the Lender to such account maintained by Lender in the United States of America or by such
other means to such other address in the United States of America as the Lender shall have notified the Borrower in writing

that the interest payable hereunder is in excess of the amount which the Lender may legally collect under the then applicable usury
laws, such amount which would be excessive interest shall be applied to the payment of the unpaid principal balance due hereunder
and not to the payment of interest.
 
Every provision
of this Note is intended to be severable. If any term or provision hereof is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
illegal or invalid, such illegal or invalid term or provision shall not affect the balance of the terms and provisions hereof,
which terms and provisions shall remain binding and enforceable.
