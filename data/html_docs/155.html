is not administratively feasible for the Administrative Agent, such Replacement Rate shall be applied in a manner as otherwise reasonably
determined by the Administrative Agent in consultation with the Borrower. If the Administrative Agent makes a determination described

remain effective with respect to such Lender until (x) the Obligations (other than unasserted contingent indemnification Obligations)
under this Agreement shall have been declared or shall have become immediately due and payable, (y) the non-Defaulting Lenders,
the Administrative Agent, and the Borrower shall have waived such Defaulting Lender’s default in writing, or (z) the Defaulting
Lender makes its Pro Rata Share of the applicable defaulted Loan and pays to the Administrative Agent all amounts owing by such Defaulting
Lender in respect thereof. The operation of this Section shall not be construed to increase or otherwise affect the Commitment of
any Lender, to relieve or excuse the performance by such Defaulting Lender or any other Lender of its duties and obligations hereunder,
or to relieve or excuse the performance by the Borrower of its duties and obligations hereunder to the Administrative Agent or to the
Lenders other than such Defaulting Lender. Any such failure to fund by any Defaulting Lender shall constitute a material breach by such
Defaulting Lender of this Agreement and shall entitle the Borrower at its option, subject to the written consent of the Administrative
Agent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), to permanently replace the Defaulting Lender with one or more substitute Lenders
(each, a “<u>Replacement Lender</u>”), and the Defaulting Lender shall have no right to refuse to be replaced hereunder.
Notice from the Borrower to the Agents effecting their right to replace the Defaulting Lender shall specify an effective date for such
replacement, which date shall not be later than fifteen (15) Business Days after the date such notice is given. Prior to the effective
date of such replacement, the Defaulting Lender and each Replacement Lender shall execute and deliver an Assignment and Acceptance, subject
only to the Defaulting Lender being repaid its share of the outstanding Obligations without any premium or penalty of any kind whatsoever.
If the Defaulting Lender shall refuse or fail to execute and deliver any such Assignment and Acceptance prior to the effective date of
such replacement, the Defaulting Lender shall be deemed to have executed and delivered such Assignment and Acceptance. The replacement
of any Defaulting Lender shall be made in accordance with the terms of <u>Section 12.07(b)</u>. Any such assumption of the Commitment
of such Defaulting Lender shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver of any of the Lenders’ or the Borrower’s rights or remedies
against any such Defaulting Lender arising out of or in relation to such failure to fund.</font></p>

deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender shall make its own independent

in to the possession of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any of their Affiliates. Each Agent may, upon any term or condition
it specifies, delegate or exercise any of its rights, powers and remedies under, and delegate or perform any of its duties or any other

against any and all Agent Indemnified Matters of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against

the Commitments have terminated, in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares immediately prior to the date on which the Term

of such Agent Indemnified Matters for which there has been a final non-appealable judicial determination that such liability resulted
from such Agent’s or such Related Parties gross negligence or willful misconduct; <i>provided, further, however</i>, that no action
taken in accordance with the directions of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be provided
by the Loan Documents) shall be deemed to constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct for the purposes of this <u>Section 10.05</u>.
In the case of any investigation, litigation or proceeding giving rise to any Agent Indemnified Matters, this <u>Section 10.05</u>
shall apply whether or not any such investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought by any Lender or any other Person. Without limiting
the foregoing, each Lender shall reimburse the Agents upon demand for its Pro Rata Share (determined as of the time that the applicable

the Commitments have terminated, in accordance with its Pro Rata Shares immediately prior to the date on which the Term Loans are paid

Lender to indemnify or reimburse the Agents shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation in respect thereof. Each Lender hereby
authorizes the Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under
any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent to such Lender from any source against any
amount due to the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent under this <u>Section 10.05</u>. The obligations of the Lenders under

It is the intention of the parties hereto that each Agent and each Lender shall conform strictly to usury laws applicable to it. Accordingly,

to it (including the laws of the United States of America and the State of New York or any other jurisdiction whose laws may be mandatorily
applicable to such Agent or such Lender notwithstanding the other provisions of this Agreement), then, in that event, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any agreement entered into in connection with or as security
for the Obligations, it is agreed as follows: (i) the aggregate of all consideration which constitutes interest under law applicable
to any Agent or any Lender that is contracted for, taken, reserved, charged or received by such Agent or such Lender under this Agreement
or any other Loan Document or agreements or otherwise in connection with the Obligations shall under no circumstances exceed the maximum
amount allowed by such applicable law, any excess shall be canceled automatically and if theretofore paid shall be credited by such Agent
or such Lender on the principal amount of the Obligations (or, to the extent that the principal amount of the Obligations shall have
been or would thereby be paid in full, refunded by such Agent or such Lender, as applicable, to the Borrower); and (ii) in the event
that the maturity of the Obligations is accelerated by reason of any Event of Default under this Agreement or otherwise, or in the event
of any required or permitted prepayment, then such consideration that constitutes interest under law applicable to any Agent or any Lender
may never include more than the maximum amount allowed by such applicable law, and excess interest, if any, provided for in this Agreement
or otherwise shall be canceled automatically by such Agent or such Lender, as applicable, as of the date of such acceleration or prepayment
and, if theretofore paid, shall be credited by such Agent or such Lender, as applicable, on the principal amount of the Obligations (or,
to the extent that the principal amount of the Obligations shall have been or would thereby be paid in full, refunded by such Agent or
such Lender to the Borrower). All sums paid or agreed to be paid to any Agent or any Lender for the use, forbearance or detention of
sums due hereunder shall, to the extent permitted by law applicable to such Agent or such Lender, be amortized, prorated, allocated and
spread throughout the full term of the Term Loans until payment in full so that the rate or amount of interest on account of any Term
Loans hereunder does not exceed the maximum amount allowed by such applicable law. If at any time and from time to time (x) the
amount of interest payable to any Agent or any Lender on any date shall be computed at the Highest Lawful Rate applicable to such Agent
or such Lender pursuant to this <u>Section 12.19</u> and (y) in respect of any subsequent interest computation period the amount
of interest otherwise payable to such Agent or such Lender would be less than the amount of interest payable to such Agent or such Lender
computed at the Highest Lawful Rate applicable to such Agent or such Lender, then the amount of interest payable to such Agent or such
Lender in respect of such subsequent interest computation period shall continue to be computed at the Highest Lawful Rate applicable
to such Agent or such Lender until the total amount of interest payable to such Agent or such Lender shall equal the total amount of
interest which would have been payable to such Agent or such Lender if the total amount of interest had been computed without giving
effect to this <u>Section 12.19</u>.</font></p>

the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Administrative Agent could purchase
the first currency with such other currency on the Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is given. The obligation of the
Borrower in respect of any such sum due from them to the Agents or the Lenders hereunder or under the other Loan Documents shall, notwithstanding
any judgment in a currency (the “<u>Judgment Currency</u>”) other than Dollars (the “<u>Agreement Currency</u>”),
be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any sum adjudged to be so
due in the Judgment Currency, the Administrative Agent may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase the Agreement Currency
with the Judgment Currency. If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to the Secured Parties
from the Borrower in the Agreement Currency, the Borrower agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to
indemnify the Secured Parties or the Person to whom such obligation was owing against such loss.</p>
