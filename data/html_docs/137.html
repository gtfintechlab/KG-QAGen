may in its discretion, unless instructed to the contrary by the Administrative Agent or the Borrower, deem that a Notice of Renewal
had been timely delivered and in such case, a Notice of Renewal shall be deemed to have been so delivered for all purposes under

Party acquires such interest in the Advance or Commitment (other than pursuant to an assignment request by the Borrower under Section

Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers and discretion under this Agreement and the other

Notes; <i>provided</i>,<i> however</i>, that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that exposes the
Administrative Agent to personal liability or that is contrary to this Agreement or applicable law, including without limitation,
for the avoidance of doubt, any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any Debtor Relief Law or that may effect
a forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any Debtor Relief Law. The Administrative
Agent agrees to give to each Lender Party prompt notice of each notice given to it by the Borrower pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Loan Document, no Person identified as a co-syndication agent, documentation
agent, senior manager, joint lead arranger or joint bookrunner, in such Person’s capacity as such, shall have any obligations

as the Lender Parties’ contractual representative, the Administrative Agent is a “representative” of the Lender
