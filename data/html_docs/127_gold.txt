Letter of Credit Application must be received by the L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. at least three (3) Business Days (or five (5) Business Days in the case of a Letter of Credit to be issued in an
Alternative Currency (or, in each case, such later date and time as the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer may agree in a particular instance in their sole discretion)) prior to the proposed issuance date or date of amendment, as the case may
be. In the case of a request for an initial issuance of a Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Application shall specify in form and detail reasonably satisfactory to the L/C Issuer: (A) the proposed issuance date of the requested Letter of
Credit (which shall be a Business Day); (B) the amount and currency thereof (and in the absence of specification of currency shall be deemed a request for a Letter of Credit denominated in Dollars); (C) the expiry date thereof; (D) the name and
address of the beneficiary thereof; (E) the documents to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; (F) the full text of any certificate or other documents to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing
thereunder; (G) the purpose and nature of the requested Letter of Credit; and (H) such other matters as the L/C Issuer may require. In the case of a request for an amendment of any outstanding Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit
Application shall specify in form and detail reasonably satisfactory to the L/C Issuer: (1) the Letter of Credit to be amended; (2) the proposed date of amendment thereof (which shall be a Business Day); (3) the nature of the proposed
amendment; and (4) such other matters as the L/C Issuer may reasonably require. Additionally, the Borrower shall furnish to the L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent such other documents and information pertaining to such requested Letter of
Credit issuance or amendment, including any Issuer Documents, as the L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent may reasonably require. 
(ii)    Unless the L/C Issuer has received written notice from any Lender, the Administrative Agent or the Borrower,
at least one Business Day prior to the requested date of 
  32 





issuance or amendment of the applicable Letter of Credit, that one or more applicable conditions contained in Article IV shall not then be satisfied, then, subject to the terms and
conditions hereof, the L/C Issuer shall, on the requested date, issue a Letter of Credit for the account of the Borrower or enter into the applicable amendment, as the case may be, in each case in accordance with the L/C Issuers usual and
customary business practices. Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the L/C Issuer a risk participation in such Letter of Credit in
an amount equal to the product of such Lenders Applicable Percentage times the amount of such Letter of Credit. 
(iii)    If the Borrower so requests in any applicable Letter of Credit Application, the L/C Issuer may, in its sole
discretion, agree to issue a Letter of Credit that has automatic extension provisions (each, an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit); provided, that, any such Auto-Extension Letter of Credit must permit the L/C Issuer to
prevent any such extension at least once in each twelve-month period (commencing with the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit) by giving prior notice to the beneficiary thereof not later than a day (the
Non-Extension Notice Date) in each such twelve-month period to be agreed upon at the time such Letter of Credit is issued. Unless otherwise directed by the L/C Issuer, the Borrower shall not
be required to make a specific request to the L/C Issuer for any such extension. Once an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit has been issued, the Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) the L/C Issuer to permit the extension of
such Letter of Credit at any time to an expiry date not later than the Letter of Credit Expiration Date; provided, that, the L/C Issuer shall not permit any such extension if (A) the L/C Issuer has determined that it would not be
permitted, or would have no obligation, at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its revised form (as extended) under the terms hereof (by reason of the provisions of clause (ii) or (iii) of
Section 2.03(a) or otherwise), or (B) it has received notice (which may be by telephone or in writing) on or before the day that is seven (7) Business Days before the
Non-Extension Notice Date (1) from the Administrative Agent that the Required Lenders have elected not to permit such extension or (2) from the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Borrower that
one or more of the applicable conditions specified in Section 4.02 is not then satisfied, and in each case directing the L/C Issuer not to permit such extension. 
(iv)    Promptly after its delivery of any Letter of Credit or any amendment to a Letter of Credit to an advising
bank with respect thereto or to the beneficiary thereof, the L/C Issuer will also deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent a true and complete copy of such Letter of Credit or amendment. 
(c)    Drawings and Reimbursements; Funding of Participations. 
(i)    Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit of any notice of a drawing under such Letter of
Credit, the L/C Issuer shall notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent thereof. In the case of a Letter of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency, the Borrower shall reimburse the L/C Issuer in such Alternative Currency, unless
(A) the L/C Issuer (at its option) shall have specified in such notice that it will require reimbursement in Dollars, or (B) in the absence of any such requirement for reimbursement in Dollars, the Borrower shall have notified the L/C
Issuer promptly following receipt of the notice of drawing that the Borrower will reimburse the L/C Issuer in Dollars. In the case of any such reimbursement in Dollars of a drawing under a Letter of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency, the
L/C Issuer shall notify the Borrower of the Dollar Equivalent of the amount of the drawing promptly following the determination thereof. Not later than 11:00 a.m. on the date of any payment by the L/C Issuer under a Letter of Credit to be reimbursed
in Dollars, or the Applicable Time on the date of any payment by the L/C Issuer under a Letter of Credit to be reimbursed in an Alternative Currency (each such date, an Honor Date), the Borrower shall reimburse the L/C Issuer
through the Administrative Agent in 
  33 





an amount equal to the amount of such drawing and in the applicable currency. In the event that (1) a drawing denominated in an Alternative Currency is to be reimbursed in Dollars pursuant
to the second sentence of this Section 2.03(c)(i) and (2) the Dollar amount paid by the Borrower, whether on or after the Honor Date, shall not be adequate on the date of that payment to purchase in accordance with
normal banking procedures a sum denominated in the Alternative Currency equal to the drawing, the Borrower agrees, as a separate and independent obligation, to indemnify the L/C Issuer for the loss resulting from its inability on that date to
purchase the Alternative Currency in the full amount of the drawing. If the Borrower fails to so reimburse the L/C Issuer by such time, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the Honor Date, the amount of the unreimbursed
drawing (expressed in Dollars in the amount of the Dollar Equivalent thereof in the case of a Letter of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency) (the Unreimbursed Amount), and the amount of such Lenders Applicable
Percentage thereof. In such event, the Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Committed Loans to be disbursed on the Honor Date in an amount equal to the Unreimbursed Amount, without regard to the minimum and
multiples specified in Section 2.02 for the principal amount of Base Rate Committed Loans, but subject to the amount of the unutilized portion of the Aggregate Commitments and the conditions set forth in
Section 4.02 (other than the delivery of a Committed Loan Notice). Any notice given by the L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 2.03(c)(i) may be given by telephone if
immediately confirmed in writing; provided, that, the lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice. 
(ii)    Each Lender shall upon any notice by the Administrative Agent pursuant to
Section 2.03(c)(i) make funds available (and the Administrative Agent may apply Cash Collateral provided for this purpose) to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer at the Administrative Agents
Office in an amount equal to its Applicable Percentage of the Unreimbursed Amount not later than 1:00 p.m. (or the Applicable Time, in the case of any Letter of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency) on the Business Day specified in such
notice by the Administrative Agent, whereupon, subject to the provisions of Section 2.03(c)(iii), each Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Committed Loan to the Borrower in such
amount. The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the L/C Issuer.  (iii)    With respect to
any Unreimbursed Amount that is not fully refinanced by a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Committed Loans because the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 cannot be satisfied or for any other reason, the Borrower shall be
deemed to have incurred from the L/C Issuer an L/C Borrowing in the amount of the Unreimbursed Amount that is not so refinanced, which L/C Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the Default
Rate. In such event, each Lenders payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(ii) shall be deemed payment in respect of its participation in such L/C Borrowing and
shall constitute an L/C Advance from such Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this Section 2.03. 
(iv)    Until each Lender funds its Committed Loan or L/C Advance pursuant to this
Section 2.03(c) to reimburse the L/C Issuer for any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of such Lenders Applicable Percentage of such amount shall be solely for the account of the L/C Issuer.
 (v)    Each Lenders obligation to make Committed Loans or L/C Advances to reimburse the L/C Issuer for
amounts drawn under Letters of Credit, as contemplated by this Section 2.03(c), shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A)

  34 





any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against the L/C Issuer, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (B) the occurrence
or continuance of a Default, or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; provided, that, each Lenders obligation to make Committed Loans pursuant to this
Section 2.03(c) is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (other than delivery by the Borrower of a Committed Loan Notice). No such making of an L/C Advance shall relieve or otherwise
impair the obligation of the Borrower to reimburse the L/C Issuer for the amount of any payment made by the L/C Issuer under any Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided herein. 
(vi)    If any Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer any
amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.03(c) by the time specified in Section 2.03(c)(ii), then, without limiting the other provisions of
this Agreement, the L/C Issuer shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such
payment is immediately available to the L/C Issuer at a rate per annum equal to the greater of the Overnight Rate and a rate determined by the L/C Issuer in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any
administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the L/C Issuer in connection with the foregoing. If such Lender pays such amount (with interest and fees as aforesaid), the amount so paid shall constitute such Lenders
Committed Loan included in the relevant Committed Borrowing or L/C Advance in respect of the relevant L/C Borrowing, as the case may be. A certificate of the L/C Issuer submitted to any Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any
amounts owing under this subsection (vi) shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  (d)    Repayment of
Participations.  (i)    At any time after the L/C Issuer has made a payment under any Letter of Credit and
has received from any Lender such Lenders L/C Advance in respect of such payment in accordance with Section 2.03(c), if the Administrative Agent receives for the account of the L/C Issuer any payment in respect of the
related Unreimbursed Amount or interest thereon (whether directly from the Borrower or otherwise, including proceeds of Cash Collateral applied thereto by the Administrative Agent), the Administrative Agent will distribute to such Lender its
Applicable Percentage thereof (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such Lenders L/C Advance was outstanding) in the same funds as those received by the Administrative Agent. 
(ii)    If any payment received by the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer pursuant to
Section 2.03(c)(i) is required to be returned under any of the circumstances described in Section 10.05 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the L/C Issuer in its discretion), each
Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer its Applicable Percentage thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned by
such Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect. The obligations of the Lenders under this subsection (ii) shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this
Agreement. 
  35 




(e)    Obligations Absolute. The obligation of the Borrower to reimburse
the L/C Issuer for each drawing under each Letter of Credit and to repay each L/C Borrowing shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all circumstances,
including the following:  (i)    any lack of validity or enforceability of such Letter of Credit, this Agreement,
or any other Loan Document;  (ii)    the existence of any claim, counterclaim, setoff, defense or other right
that the Borrower or any Subsidiary may have at any time against any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), the L/C Issuer or any other Person,
whether in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or by such Letter of Credit or any agreement or instrument relating thereto, or any unrelated transaction; 
(iii)    any draft, demand, certificate or other document presented under such Letter of Credit proving to be forged,
fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; or any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under such Letter of
Credit;  (iv)    waiver by the L/C Issuer of any requirement that exists for the L/C Issuers protection and
not the protection of the Borrower or any waiver by the L/C Issuer which does not in fact materially prejudice the Borrower; 
(v)    honor of a demand for payment presented electronically even if such Letter of Credit requires that demand be
in the form of a draft;  (vi)    any payment made by the L/C Issuer in respect of an otherwise complying item
presented after the date specified as the expiration date of, or the date by which documents must be received under such Letter of Credit if presentation after such date is authorized by the Uniform Commercial Code or the ISP, as applicable; 
(vii)    any payment by the L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft, certificate or
other document that does not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; or any payment made by the L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit to any Person purporting to be a trustee in bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidator, receiver or other representative of or successor to any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit, including any arising
in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law;  (viii)    any other circumstance or happening
whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, including any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Borrower or any Subsidiary; or 
(ix)    any adverse change in the relevant exchange rates or in the availability of the relevant Alternative Currency
to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or in the relevant currency markets generally.  The Borrower shall promptly examine a copy of each Letter of
Credit and each amendment thereto that is delivered to it and, in the event of any claim of noncompliance with the Borrowers instructions or other irregularity, the Borrower will immediately notify the L/C Issuer. The Borrower shall be
conclusively deemed to have waived any such claim against the L/C Issuer and its correspondents unless such notice is given as aforesaid. 
  36 




(f)    Role of L/C Issuer. Each Lender and the Borrower agree that, in
paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit, the L/C Issuer shall not have any responsibility to obtain any document (other than any sight draft, certificates and documents expressly required by the Letter of Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as to
the validity or accuracy of any such document or the authority of the Person executing or delivering any such document. None of the L/C Issuer, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant or
assignee of the L/C Issuer shall be liable to any Lender for: (i) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the approval of the Lenders or the Required Lenders, as applicable; (ii) any action taken or
omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and nonappealable judgment; or (iii) the due execution, effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any document or
instrument related to any Letter of Credit or Issuer Document or underlying transaction. The Borrower hereby assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit;
provided, that, this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude the Borrowers pursuing such rights and remedies as it may have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other agreement. None of the L/C
Issuer, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of the L/C Issuer shall be liable or responsible for any of the matters described in subsections (i) through
(ix) of Section 2.03(e); provided, that, anything in such subsections to the contrary notwithstanding, the Borrower may have a claim against the L/C Issuer, and the L/C Issuer may be liable to the
Borrower, to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to consequential, special, indirect or incidental, punitive or exemplary, damages suffered by the Borrower which the Borrower proves were caused by the L/C Issuers
willful misconduct or gross negligence as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and nonappealable judgment or the L/C Issuers willful failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the
beneficiary of a sight draft, certificate(s) or other documents strictly complying with the terms and conditions of a Letter of Credit unless the L/C Issuer is prevented or prohibited from so paying as a result of any order or directive of any court
or other Governmental Authority. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the L/C Issuer may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or
information to the contrary, and the L/C Issuer shall not be responsible for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or
proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason. The L/C Issuer may send a Letter of Credit or conduct any communication to or from the beneficiary via the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial
Telecommunication (SWIFT) message or overnight courier, or any other commercially reasonable means of communicating with a beneficiary. 
(g)    Applicability of ISP; Limitation of Liability. Unless otherwise expressly agreed by the L/C Issuer and the Borrower
when a Letter of Credit is issued, the rules of the ISP shall apply to each Letter of Credit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the L/C Issuer shall not be responsible to the Borrower for, and the L/C Issuers rights and remedies against the
Borrower shall not be impaired by, any action or inaction of the L/C Issuer required or permitted under any law, order, or practice referred to below that is required or permitted to be applied to any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, including
the Law or any order of a jurisdiction where the L/C Issuer or the beneficiary is located, the practice stated in the ISP, or in the decisions, opinions, practice statements, or official commentary of the ICC Banking Commission, the Bankers
Association for Finance and Trade - International Financial Services Association (BAFT-IFSA), or the Institute of International Banking Law & Practice, whether or not any Letter of Credit chooses such law or practice. 
(h)    Letter of Credit Fees. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of each Lender, in
accordance, subject to Section 2.15, with its Applicable Percentage a Letter of Credit fee (the Letter of Credit Fee) for each Letter of Credit equal to the Applicable Rate times the Dollar
Equivalent of the daily amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. For purposes of 
  37 





computing the daily amount available to be drawn under any Letter of Credit, the amount of such Letter of Credit shall be determined in accordance with Section 1.06.
Letter of Credit Fees shall be (i) due and payable on the first Business Day after the end of each March, June, September and December, commencing with the first such date to occur after the issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the Letter of
Credit Expiration Date and thereafter on demand and (ii) computed on a quarterly basis in arrears. If there is any change in the Applicable Rate during any quarter, the daily amount available to be drawn under each Letter of Credit shall be
computed and multiplied by the Applicable Rate separately for each period during such quarter that such Applicable Rate was in effect. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, upon the request of the Required Lenders, while any
Event of Default exists, all Letter of Credit Fees shall accrue at the Default Rate.  (i)    Fronting Fee and Documentary and
Processing Charges Payable to L/C Issuer. The Borrower shall pay directly to the L/C Issuer for its own account a fronting fee with respect to each Letter of Credit, at the rate per annum specified in the Agent Fee Letter, computed on the Dollar
Equivalent of the daily amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit and on a quarterly basis in arrears. Such fronting fee shall be due and payable on the tenth Business Day after the end of each March, June, September and December in
respect of the most recently-ended quarterly period (or portion thereof, in the case of the first payment), commencing with the first such date to occur after the issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the Letter of Credit Expiration Date and
thereafter on demand. For purposes of computing the Dollar Equivalent of the daily amount available to be drawn under any Letter of Credit, the amount of such Letter of Credit shall be determined in accordance with
Section 1.06. In addition, the Borrower shall pay directly to the L/C Issuer for its own account the customary issuance, presentation, amendment and other processing fees, and other standard costs and charges, of the L/C
Issuer relating to letters of credit as from time to time in effect. Such customary fees and standard costs and charges are due and payable on demand and are nonrefundable. 
(j)    Conflict with Issuer Documents. In the event of any conflict between the terms hereof and the terms of any Issuer
Document, the terms hereof shall control.  Section 2.04    Swing Line Loans 
(a)    The Swing Line. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Swing Line Lender agrees, in reliance upon
the agreements of the other Lenders set forth in this Section 2.04, to make loans (each such loan, a Swing Line Loan) denominated in Dollars to the Borrower from time to time on any Business Day during
the Availability Period in an aggregate amount not to exceed at any time outstanding the amount of the Swing Line Sublimit, notwithstanding the fact that such Swing Line Loans, when aggregated with the Applicable Percentage of the Outstanding Amount
of Committed Loans and L/C Obligations of the Lender acting as Swing Line Lender, may exceed the amount of such Lenders Commitment; provided, that, (x) after giving effect to any Swing Line Loan, (i) the Total
Outstandings shall not exceed the Aggregate Commitments, and (ii) the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Committed Loans of any Lender, plus such Lenders Applicable Percentage of the Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations,
plus such Lenders Applicable Percentage of the Outstanding Amount of all Swing Line Loans shall not exceed such Lenders Commitment, (y) the Borrower shall not use the proceeds of any Swing Line Loan to refinance any
outstanding Swing Line Loan, and (z) the Swing Line Lender shall not be under any obligation to make any Swing Line Loan to the extent it shall determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that it has,
or by such Credit Extension may have, Fronting Exposure. Within the foregoing limits, and subject to the other terms and conditions hereof, the Borrower may borrow under this Section 2.04, prepay under
Section 2.05, and reborrow under this Section 2.04. Each Swing Line Loan shall be a Base Rate Loan. Immediately upon the making of a Swing Line Loan, each Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the Swing Line Lender a risk participation in such Swing Line Loan in an amount equal to the product of such Lenders Applicable Percentage times the amount of such Swing Line
Loan. 
  38 




(b)    Borrowing Procedures. Each Swing Line Borrowing shall be made upon
the Borrowers irrevocable notice to the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent, which may be given by telephone or by a Swing Line Loan Notice; provided, that, any telephonic notice must be confirmed promptly by delivery
to the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent of a Swing Line Loan Notice. Each such notice must be received by the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent not later than 1:00 p.m. on the requested borrowing date, and shall specify
(i) the amount to be borrowed, which shall be a minimum of $100,000, and (ii) the requested borrowing date, which shall be a Business Day. Promptly after receipt by the Swing Line Lender of any Swing Line Loan Notice, the Swing Line Lender
will confirm with the Administrative Agent that the Administrative Agent has also received such Swing Line Loan Notice and, if not, the Swing Line Lender will notify the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) of the contents thereof.
Unless the Swing Line Lender has received notice (by telephone or in writing) from the Administrative Agent (including at the request of any Lender) prior to 2:00 p.m. on the date of the proposed Swing Line Borrowing (A) directing the Swing
Line Lender not to make such Swing Line Loan as a result of the limitations set forth in the first proviso to the first sentence of Section 2.04(a), or (B) that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in
Article IV is not then satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Swing Line Lender will, not later than 3:00 p.m. on the borrowing date specified in such Swing Line Loan Notice, make the amount of its Swing Line Loan
available to the Borrower.  (c)    Refinancing of Swing Line Loans. 
(i)    The Swing Line Lender at any time in its sole and absolute discretion may request, on behalf of the Borrower
(which hereby irrevocably requests and authorizes the Swing Line Lender to so request on its behalf), that each Lender make a Base Rate Committed Loan in an amount equal to such Lenders Applicable Percentage of the amount of Swing Line Loans
then outstanding. Such request shall be made in writing (which written request shall be deemed to be a Committed Loan Notice for purposes hereof) and in accordance with the requirements of Section 2.02, without regard to
the minimum and multiples specified therein for the principal amount of Base Rate Committed Loans, but subject to the unutilized portion of the Aggregate Commitments and the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (other than
delivery of a Committed Loan Notice). The Swing Line Lender shall furnish the Borrower with a copy of the applicable Committed Loan Notice promptly after delivering such notice to the Administrative Agent. Each Lender shall make an amount equal to
its Applicable Percentage of the amount specified in such Committed Loan Notice available to the Administrative Agent in Same Day Funds (and the Administrative Agent may apply Cash Collateral available with respect to the applicable Swing Line Loan)
for the account of the Swing Line Lender at the Administrative Agents Office for Dollar-denominated payments not later than 1:00 p.m. on the day specified in such Committed Loan Notice, whereupon, subject to
Section 2.04(c)(ii), each Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Committed Loan to the Borrower in such amount. The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the Swing
Line Lender.  (ii)    If for any reason any Swing Line Loan cannot be refinanced by such a Committed Borrowing in
accordance with Section 2.04(c)(i), the request for Base Rate Committed Loans submitted by the Swing Line Lender as set forth herein shall be deemed to be a request by the Swing Line Lender that each of the Lenders fund its
risk participation in the relevant Swing Line Loan and each Lenders payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swing Line Lender pursuant to Section 2.04(c)(i) shall be deemed payment in respect of
such participation. 
  39 




(iii)    If any Lender fails to make available to
the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swing Line Lender any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.04(c) by the time specified in
Section 2.04(c)(i), the Swing Line Lender shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is
required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the Swing Line Lender at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees
customarily charged by the Swing Line Lender in connection with the foregoing. If such Lender pays such amount (with interest and fees as aforesaid), the amount so paid shall constitute such Lenders Committed Loan included in the relevant
Committed Borrowing or funded participation in the relevant Swing Line Loan, as the case may be. A certificate of the Swing Line Lender submitted to any Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this
subsection (iii) shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  (iv)    Each Lenders obligation to
make Committed Loans or to purchase and fund risk participations in Swing Line Loans pursuant to this Section 2.04(c) shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any
setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against the Swing Line Lender, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (C) any other
occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; provided, that, each Lenders obligation to make Committed Loans pursuant to this Section 2.04(c) is subject to the
conditions set forth in Section 4.02. No such funding of risk participations shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrower to repay Swing Line Loans, together with interest as provided herein. 
(d)    Repayment of Participations. 
(i)    At any time after any Lender has purchased and funded a risk participation in a Swing Line Loan, if the Swing
Line Lender receives any payment on account of such Swing Line Loan, the Swing Line Lender will distribute to such Lender its Applicable Percentage of such payment (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of
time during which such Lenders risk participation was funded) in the same funds as those received by the Swing Line Lender. 
(ii)    If any payment received by the Swing Line Lender in respect of principal or interest on any Swing Line Loan
is required to be returned by the Swing Line Lender under any of the circumstances described in Section 10.05 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Swing Line Lender in its discretion), each Lender shall
pay to the Swing Line Lender its Applicable Percentage thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned, at a rate per annum equal to the applicable
Overnight Rate. The Administrative Agent will make such demand upon the request of the Swing Line Lender. The obligations of the Lenders under this subsection (ii) shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination
of this Agreement.  (e)    Interest for Account of Swing Line Lender. The Swing Line Lender shall be responsible for
invoicing the Borrower for interest on the Swing Line Loans. Until each Lender funds its Base Rate Committed Loan or risk participation pursuant to this Section 2.04 to refinance such Lenders Applicable Percentage of
any Swing Line Loan, interest in respect of such Applicable Percentage shall be solely for the account of the Swing Line Lender.

(f)    Payments Directly to Swing Line Lender. The Borrower shall make all
payments of principal and interest in respect of the Swing Line Loans directly to the Swing Line Lender. 
Section 2.05    Prepayments 
(a)    Voluntary Prepayments. The Borrower may, upon notice to the Administrative Agent, at any time or from time to time
voluntarily prepay Committed Loans in whole or in part without premium or penalty; provided, that, unless otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion, (i) such notice must be received by the Administrative
Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. (A) three (3) Business Days prior to any date of prepayment of Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Dollars, (B) four (4) Business Days (or five (5) Business Days, in the case of prepayment of
Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Special Notice Currencies) prior to any date of prepayment of Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Alternative Currencies, and (C) on the date of prepayment of Base Rate Committed Loans; (ii) any
prepayment of Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Dollars shall be in a principal amount of $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof (or, if less, the entire principal amount thereof then outstanding); (iii) any prepayment
of Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Alternative Currencies shall be in a principal amount of the Dollar Equivalent of $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of the Dollar Equivalent of $1,000,000 in excess thereof (or, if less, the entire principal
amount thereof then outstanding); and (iv) any prepayment of Base Rate Committed Loans shall be in a principal amount of $500,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof (or, if less, the entire principal amount thereof then
outstanding). Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the date, currency and amount of such prepayment and the Type(s) of Committed Loans to be prepaid and, if Eurocurrency Rate Loans are to be prepaid, the Interest Period(s) of such
Loans. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Lender of its receipt of each such notice, and of the amount of such Lenders Applicable Percentage of such prepayment. If such notice is given by the Borrower, the Borrower shall make
such prepayment and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein. Any prepayment of a Eurocurrency Rate Loan shall be accompanied by all accrued interest on the amount prepaid, together with any
additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.05. Each such prepayment shall be applied to the Committed Loans of the Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages. 
(b)    Swing Line Loans. The Borrower may, upon notice to the Swing Line Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at
any time or from time to time, voluntarily prepay Swing Line Loans in whole or in part without premium or penalty; provided, that, unless otherwise agreed by the Swing Line Lender in its sole discretion, (i) such notice must be
received by the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent not later than 1:00 p.m. on the date of the prepayment, and (ii) any such prepayment shall be in a minimum principal amount of $100,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess
thereof (or, if less, the entire principal thereof then outstanding). Each such notice shall specify the date and amount of such prepayment. If such notice is given by the Borrower, the Borrower shall make such prepayment and the payment amount
specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein.  (c)    Mandatory Prepayments. If for
any reason the Total Outstandings at any time exceed the Aggregate Commitments then in effect, the Borrower shall immediately prepay Loans and/or Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations in an aggregate amount equal to such excess; provided,
that, the Borrower shall not be required to Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations pursuant to this Section 2.05(c) unless after the prepayment in full of the Loans the Total Outstandings exceed the Aggregate
Commitments then in effect. All prepayments under this Section 2.05(c) shall be applied ratably to Committed Loans and Swing Line Loans and, after all Committed Loans and Swing Line Loans have been repaid, to Cash
Collateralize L/C Obligations. Within the parameters of the applications set forth above, prepayments shall be applied first to Base Rate Loans and then to Eurocurrency Rate Loans in direct order of Interest Period maturities. All prepayments under
this Section 2.05(c) shall be subject to Section 3.05, but otherwise without premium or penalty, and shall be accompanied by interest on the principal amount prepaid through the date of prepayment.

  41 




Section 2.06    Termination or Reduction of Aggregate Commitments 
(a)    Optional Reductions. The Borrower may, upon notice to the Administrative Agent, terminate the Aggregate Commitments,
the Letter of Credit Sublimit or the Swing Line Sublimit, or from time to time permanently reduce the Aggregate Commitments (to an amount not less than the Total Outstandings), the Letter of Credit Sublimit or the Swing Line Sublimit;
provided, that, unless otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion, (i) any such notice shall be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 12:00 noon five (5) Business Days prior to the date
of termination or reduction, (ii) any such partial reduction shall be in an aggregate amount of $10,000,000 or any whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and (iii) the Borrower shall not terminate or reduce (A) the Aggregate
Commitments if, after giving effect thereto and to any concurrent prepayments hereunder, the Total Outstandings would exceed the Aggregate Commitments, (B) the Letter of Credit Sublimit if, after giving effect thereto, the Outstanding Amount of
L/C Obligations not fully Cash Collateralized hereunder would exceed the Letter of Credit Sublimit, or (C) the Swing Line Sublimit if, after giving effect thereto and to any concurrent prepayments hereunder, the Outstanding Amount of Swing Line
Loans would exceed the Swing Line Sublimit.  (b)    Mandatory Reductions. If after giving effect to any reduction or
termination of the Aggregate Commitments under this Section 2.06, the Letter of Credit Sublimit or the Swing Line Sublimit exceeds the Aggregate Commitments at such time, the Letter of Credit Sublimit or the Swing Line
Sublimit, as the case may be, shall be automatically reduced by the amount of such excess.  (c)    Notice. The
Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Lenders of any termination or reduction of the Letter of Credit Sublimit, the Swing Line Sublimit or the Aggregate Commitments under this Section 2.06. Upon any reduction of the
Aggregate Commitments, the Commitment of each Lender shall be reduced by such Lenders Applicable Percentage of such reduction amount. All fees in respect of the Aggregate Commitments accrued until the effective date of any termination of the
Aggregate Commitments shall be paid on the effective date of such termination.  Section 2.07    Repayment of Loans
 (a)    The Borrower shall repay to the Lenders on the Maturity Date the aggregate principal amount of Committed Loans
outstanding on such date.  (b)    The Borrower shall repay each Swing Line Loan on the earlier to occur of (i) the date ten
(10) Business Days after such Swing Line Loan is made and (ii) the Maturity Date.  Section 2.08    Interest
 (a)    Subject to the provisions of subsection (b) below: (i) each Eurocurrency Rate Loan shall bear interest on
the outstanding principal amount thereof for each Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to the Eurocurrency Rate for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Rate; (ii) each Base Rate Committed Loan shall bear interest on the
outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate; and (iii) each Swing Line Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof
from the applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate. 
  42 




(b)    (i) If any amount of principal of any Loan is not paid when due (without
regard to any applicable grace periods), whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, such amount shall thereafter bear interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Laws.  (ii)    If any amount (other than principal of any Loan) payable by the Borrower
under any Loan Document is not paid when due (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods), whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, then upon the request of the Required Lenders, such amount shall thereafter bear interest
at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws. 
(iii)    Accrued and unpaid interest on past due amounts (including interest on past due interest) shall be due and
payable upon demand.  (c)    Interest on each Loan shall be due and payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date applicable
thereto and at such other times as may be specified herein. Interest hereunder shall be due and payable in accordance with the terms hereof before and after judgment, and before and after the commencement of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief
Law.  Section 2.09    Fees. In addition to certain fees described in subsections
(h) and (i) of Section 2.03:  (a)    Commitment Fee. The
Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender in accordance with its Applicable Percentage, a commitment fee (the Commitment Fee) in Dollars equal to the Applicable Rate times the actual
daily amount by which the Aggregate Commitments exceed the sum of (i) the Outstanding Amount of Committed Loans and (ii) the Outstanding Amount of L/C Obligations, subject to adjustment as provided in
Section 2.15. For the avoidance of doubt, the Outstanding Amount of Swing Line Loans shall not be counted towards or considered usage of the Aggregate Commitments for purposes of determining the Commitment Fee. The
Commitment Fee shall accrue at all times during the Availability Period, including at any time during which one or more of the conditions in Article IV is not met, and shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of
each March, June, September and December, commencing with the first such date to occur after the Closing Date, and on the last day of the Availability Period. The Commitment Fee shall be calculated quarterly in arrears, and if there is any change in
the Applicable Rate during any quarter, the actual daily amount shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Rate separately for each period during such quarter that such Applicable Rate was in effect. 
(b)    Other Fees. 
(ii)    The Borrower shall pay to BofA Securities and the Administrative Agent, for their own respective accounts,
fees in the amounts and at the times specified in the Agent Fee Letter. Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever. 
(iii)    The Borrower shall pay to the Lenders such fees as shall have been separately agreed upon in writing in the
amounts and at the times so specified. Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever. 
Section 2.10    Computation of Interest and Fees. All computations of interest for Base Rate Loans
(including Base Rate Committed Loans determined by reference to the Eurocurrency Rate) shall be 
  43 





made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed. All other computations of fees and interest shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed (which results in more fees or interest, as applicable, being paid than if computed on the basis of a 365-day year), or, in the case of
interest in respect of Committed Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency as to which market practice differs from the foregoing, in accordance with such market practice. Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made,
and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion is paid; provided, that, any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall, subject to
Section 2.12(a), bear interest for one day. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. 
Section 2.11    Evidence of Debt 
(a)    The Credit Extensions made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and
by the Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of business. The Administrative Agent shall maintain the Register in accordance with Section 10.06(c). The accounts or records maintained by each Lender shall be conclusive
absent manifest error of the amount of the Credit Extensions made by the Lenders to the Borrower and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of
the Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the Register, the Register shall control in the absence of manifest error.
Upon the request of any Lender made through the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative Agent) a Note which shall evidence such Lenders Loans in addition to such accounts or
records. Each Lender may attach schedules to its Note and endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount, currency and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto. 
(b)    In addition to the accounts and records referred to in subsection (a) above, each Lender and the Administrative
Agent shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice accounts or records evidencing the purchases and sales by such Lender of participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and
records maintained by the Administrative Agent and the accounts and records of any Lender in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. 
Section 2.12    Payments Generally; Administrative Agents Clawback 
(a)    General. All payments to be made by the Borrower shall be made free and clear of and without condition or deduction for
any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein and except with respect to principal of and interest on Committed Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency, all payments by the Borrower hereunder
shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders or the L/C Issuer, as applicable, to which such payment is owed, at the Administrative Agents Office in Dollars and in Same Day Funds not later than 2:00 p.m.
on the date specified herein. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrower hereunder with respect to principal and interest on Committed Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency shall be made to the Administrative
Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the Administrative Agents Office in such Alternative Currency and in Same Day Funds not later than the Applicable Time specified by the Administrative Agent on
the dates specified herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent may require that any payments due under this Agreement be made in the United States. If, for any reason, the Borrower is prohibited by any Law
from making any required payment hereunder in an Alternative Currency, the Borrower shall make such payment in Dollars in the Dollar Equivalent of the Alternative Currency payment 
  44 





amount. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender or the L/C Issuer, as applicable, its Applicable Percentage (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment
in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lenders Lending Office or to the L/C Issuer, as applicable. All payments received by the Administrative Agent (i) after 2:00 p.m., in the case of payments in Dollars, or (ii) after
the Applicable Time specified by the Administrative Agent in the case of payments in an Alternative Currency, shall in each case be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue.
Subject to the definition of Interest Period, if any payment to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be
reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be.  (b)    (i) Funding by Lenders; Presumptions by Administrative
Agent. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Committed Borrowing of Eurocurrency Rate Loans (or, in the case of any Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Committed Loans, prior to
12:00 noon on the date of such Committed Borrowing) that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lenders share of such Committed Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share
available on such date in accordance with Section 2.02 (or, in the case of any Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Committed Loans, that such Lender has made such share available in accordance with and at the time required by
Section 2.02) and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Committed Borrowing available to
the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date
such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the Overnight Rate, plus any administrative, processing or similar
fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing, and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Committed Loans (or, in the case of Alternative
Currencies, in accordance with such market practice, as applicable). If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the
Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Committed Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lenders Committed Loan
included in such Committed Borrowing. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent. 
(ii)    Payments by Borrower; Presumptions by Administrative Agent. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have
received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the L/C Issuer hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume
that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact
made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, in Same Day Funds with interest
thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Overnight Rate. 
  45 




A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect to any amount owing
under this subsection (b) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.  (c)    Failure to Satisfy Conditions
Precedent. If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this Article II, and such funds are not made available to the Borrower by the
Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable Credit Extension set forth in Article IV are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent promptly shall return such funds (in like funds
as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest.  (d)    Obligations of Lenders Several. The obligations
of the Lenders hereunder to make Committed Loans, to fund participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans and to make payments pursuant to Section 10.04(c) are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to
make any Committed Loan, to fund any such participation or to make any payment under Section 10.04(c) on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date,
and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Committed Loan, to purchase its participation or to make its payment under Section 10.04(c). 
(e)    Funding Source. Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any
particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner. Each Lender at its option may make any Credit Extension or otherwise perform its
obligations hereunder through any Lending Office (each, a Designated Lender); provided, that, any exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay any Credit Extension in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement. Any Designated Lender shall be considered a Lender; provided, that, the designation of a Designated Lender is for administrative convenience only and does not expand the scope of liabilities or
obligations of any Lender or Designated Lender beyond those of the Lender designating such Person as a Designated Lender as provided in this Agreement. 
Section 2.13    Sharing of Payments by Lenders. If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of
setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of the Committed Loans made by it, or the participations in L/C Obligations or in Swing Line Loans held by it (excluding any amounts applied by the
Swing Line Lender to outstanding Swing Line Loans) resulting in such Lenders receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of such Committed Loans or participations and accrued interest thereon greater than its pro rata share
thereof as provided herein, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Committed Loans and subparticipations in
L/C Obligations and Swing Line Loans of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of
and accrued interest on their respective Committed Loans and other amounts owing them; provided, that: 
(i)    if any such participations or subparticipations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving
rise thereto is recovered, such participations or subparticipations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and 
(ii)    the provisions of this Section 2.13 shall not be construed to apply to (x) any
payment made by or on behalf of the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender), (y) the application of Cash Collateral
provided for in Section 2.14, or (z) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in 
  46 





any of its Committed Loans or subparticipations in L/C Obligations or Swing Line Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary (as to which the provisions of
this Section 2.13 shall apply).  The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so
under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct
creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.  Section 2.14    Cash Collateral 
(a)    Certain Credit Support Events. If (i) the L/C Issuer has honored any full or partial drawing request under any
Letter of Credit and such drawing has resulted in an L/C Borrowing, (ii) as of the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, any L/C Obligation for any reason remains outstanding, (iii) the Borrower shall be required to provide Cash Collateral
pursuant to Section 8.02(c), or (iv) there shall exist a Defaulting Lender, the Borrower shall immediately (in the case of subsection (iii) above) or within one Business Day (in all other cases) following
any request by the Administrative Agent or the L/C Issuer, provide Cash Collateral in an amount not less than the applicable Minimum Collateral Amount (determined in the case of Cash Collateral provided pursuant to subsection (iv) above,
after giving effect to Section 2.15(a)(iv) and any Cash Collateral provided by the Defaulting Lender). Additionally, if the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower at any time that the Outstanding Amount of all L/C
Obligations at such time exceeds one hundred five percent (105%) of the Letter of Credit Sublimit then in effect, then within two (2) Business Days after receipt of such notice, the Borrower shall provide Cash Collateral for the Outstanding
Amount of the L/C Obligations in an amount not less than the amount by which the Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations exceeds the Letter of Credit Sublimit. 
(b)    Grant of Security Interest. The Borrower, and to the extent provided by any Defaulting Lender, such Defaulting Lender,
hereby grants to (and subjects to the control of) the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and the Lenders, and agrees to maintain, a first priority security interest in all such cash, deposit accounts
and all balances therein, and all other property so provided as collateral pursuant hereto, and in all proceeds of the foregoing, all as security for the obligations to which such Cash Collateral may be applied pursuant to
Section 2.14(c). If at any time the Administrative Agent reasonably determines that Cash Collateral is subject to any right or claim of any Person other than the Administrative Agent or the L/C Issuer as herein provided, or
that the total amount of such Cash Collateral is less than the Minimum Collateral Amount, the Borrower will, promptly upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay or provide to the Administrative Agent additional Cash Collateral in an amount
sufficient to eliminate such deficiency. All Cash Collateral (other than credit support not constituting funds subject to deposit) shall be maintained in blocked deposit accounts at Bank of America. The Borrower shall pay on demand therefor from
time to time all customary account opening, activity and other administrative fees and charges in connection with the maintenance and disbursement of Cash Collateral. 
(c)    Application. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Cash Collateral provided under any
of this Section 2.14 or Sections 2.03, 2.05, 2.15 or 8.02 in respect of Letters of Credit shall be held and applied in satisfaction of the specific L/C Obligations, obligations to fund
participations therein (including, as to Cash Collateral provided by a Defaulting Lender, any interest accrued on such obligation) and other obligations for which the Cash Collateral was so provided, prior to any other application of such property
as may otherwise be provided for herein.  (d)    Release. Cash Collateral (or the appropriate portion thereof) shall be
released promptly following (i) the elimination of the applicable Fronting Exposure or other obligations giving rise thereto 
  47 





(including by the termination of Defaulting Lender status of the applicable Lender) (or, as appropriate, its assignee following compliance with Section 10.06(b)(vi)) or
(ii) the reasonable determination by the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer that there exists excess Cash Collateral; provided, that, (x) any such release shall be without prejudice to, and any disbursement or other
transfer of Cash Collateral shall be and remain subject to, any other Lien conferred under the Loan Documents and the other applicable provisions of the Loan Documents, and (y) the Person providing Cash Collateral and the L/C Issuer may agree
that Cash Collateral shall not be released but instead held to support future anticipated Fronting Exposure or other obligations. 
Section 2.15    Defaulting Lenders 
(a)    Adjustments. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting
Lender, then, until such time as that Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable Law: 
(i)    Waivers and Amendment. Such Defaulting Lenders right to approve or disapprove any amendment,
waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in the definition of Required Lenders and Section 10.01. 
(ii)    Defaulting Lender Waterfall. Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amount received by the
Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Article IX or otherwise) or received by the Administrative Agent from a Defaulting Lender pursuant to
Section 10.08), shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent
hereunder; second, to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the L/C Issuer or the Swing Line Lender hereunder; third, to Cash Collateralize the L/C Issuers Fronting
Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender in accordance with Section 2.14; fourth, as the Borrower may request (so long as no Default or Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which
such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent; fifth, if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to be held in a deposit account and
released pro rata in order to (x) satisfy such Defaulting Lenders potential future funding obligations with respect to Loans under this Agreement and (y) Cash Collateralize the L/C Issuers future Fronting Exposure with respect
to such Defaulting Lender with respect to future Letters of Credit issued under this Agreement, in accordance with Section 2.14; sixth, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders, the L/C Issuer or the Swing
Line Lender as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender, the L/C Issuer or the Swing Line Lender against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under
this Agreement; seventh, so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against that Defaulting
Lender as a result of that Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and eighth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided, that, if
(x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans or L/C Borrowings in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share, and (y) such Loans were made or the related Letters of Credit were
issued at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to the pay the Loans of, and L/C Obligations owed to, all
Non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of, or L/C Obligations owed to, such Defaulting Lender until such time as all Loans and funded and
unfunded participations in L/C Obligations and Swing Line Loans are 
  48 





held by the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the Commitments hereunder without giving effect to Section 2.15(a)(iv). Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid
or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section 2.15(a)(ii) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such
Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.  (iii)    Certain Fees. 
(A)    No Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive any fee payable under
Section 2.09(a) for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and the Borrower shall not be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to that Defaulting
Lender).  (B)    Each Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive Letter of Credit Fees for any period during
which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender only to the extent allocable to its Applicable Percentage of the stated amount of Letters of Credit for which it has provided Cash Collateral pursuant to Section 2.14. 
(C)    With respect to any Letter of Credit Fee not required to be paid to any Defaulting Lender pursuant to
subsection (B) above, the Borrower shall (x) pay to each Non-Defaulting Lender that portion of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender with respect to such Defaulting
Lenders participation in L/C Obligations that has been reallocated to such Non-Defaulting Lender pursuant to subsection (iv) below, (y) pay to the L/C Issuer the amount of any such fee
otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender to the extent allocable to the L/C Issuers Fronting Exposure to such Defaulting Lender, and (z) not be required to pay the remaining amount of any such fee. 
(iv)    Reallocation of Applicable Percentages to Reduce Fronting Exposure. All or any part of such Defaulting
Lenders participation in L/C Obligations and Swing Line Loans shall be reallocated among the Non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages (calculated without regard
to such Defaulting Lenders Commitment) but only to the extent that such reallocation does not cause the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Committed Loans of any Non-Defaulting Lender, plus such Non-Defaulting Lenders Applicable Percentage of the Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations, plus such Non-Defaulting Lenders Applicable Percentage of the
Outstanding Amount of all Swing Line Loans to exceed such Non-Defaulting Lenders Commitment. Subject to Section 10.20, no reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or
release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a Non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such Non-Defaulting Lenders increased exposure following such reallocation. 
(v)    Cash Collateral, Repayment of Swing Line Loans. If the reallocation described in subsection
(a)(iv) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrower shall, without prejudice to any right or remedy available to it hereunder or under applicable Law, (x) first, prepay Swing Line Loans in an amount equal to the
Swing Line Lenders Fronting Exposure and (y) second, Cash Collateralize the L/C Issuers Fronting Exposure in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.14. 
(b)    Defaulting Lender Cure. If the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Swing Line Lender and the L/C Issuer agree in
writing that a Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include
arrangements with respect to any 
  49 





Cash Collateral), that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may
determine to be necessary to cause the Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans to be held on a pro rata basis by the Lenders in accordance with their Applicable Percentages (without giving
effect to Section 2.15(a)(iv)), whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided, that, no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on
behalf of the Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; provided, further, that, except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will
constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender having been a Defaulting Lender. 
Section 2.16    Extension of Maturity Date 
(a)    The Borrower may request in writing that the Lenders extend the then-current Maturity Date for an additional one year (and the
Administrative Agent shall promptly give the Lenders notice of any such request); provided, that, the Maturity Date may be extended under this Section 2.16 no more than two times in the aggregate;
provided, further, that, any such request shall be made not less than twenty (20) days prior to the then-current Maturity Date. Each Lender shall provide the Administrative Agent, not more than fifteen (15) days
subsequent to any such request by the Borrower (or such other date as the Borrower and the Administrative Agent may agree; such date, the Extension Request Date), with written notice regarding whether it agrees to extend the
then-current Maturity Date (each Lender agreeing to a requested extension being called an Extending Lender, and each Lender declining to agree to a requested extension being called a
Non-Extending Lender). Each decision by a Lender shall be in its sole discretion and any Lender who fails to give timely written notice hereunder shall be deemed a Non-Extending Lender.  (b)    If all Lenders agree in writing to the extension request by the
Extension Request Date, then the Maturity Date shall be extended to the first anniversary of the Maturity Date then in effect. If Lenders constituting Required Lenders, but not all Lenders, agree in writing to the extension request by the Extension
Request Date, then the Borrower may, on the Extension Request Date, notify the Administrative Agent in writing that it wishes to extend the Maturity Date, and the Maturity Date shall, as to the Commitments and Loans of the Extending Lenders, be
extended to the first anniversary of the Maturity Date then in effect prior to giving effect to any such extension (such Maturity Date, the Existing Maturity Date). The Borrower shall, on the Existing Maturity Date, pay to the Non-Extending Lenders in effect immediately prior to such extension in immediately available funds the principal of and interest accrued on the portion of the Loans hereunder held by the Non-Extending Lenders, as well as all other amounts due and payable to the Non-Extending Lenders (including amounts required pursuant to
Section 3.05), on such date. Upon such Existing Maturity Date, (i) the Commitments of each such Non-Extending Lender shall terminate, (ii) each such Non-Extending Lender shall cease to be a Lender hereunder, (iii) the Aggregate Commitments shall be reduced by an amount equal to the aggregate Commitments of each such
Non-Extending Lender and (iv) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 2.13, all outstanding Loans of each such Non-Extending
Lender shall be paid in full.  (c)    Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.16,
the Borrower shall have the right, at its own discretion and at its own expense, at any time prior to the Existing Maturity Date to replace, in accordance with the terms of Section 10.13, a
Non-Extending Lender with an Eligible Assignee that will agree to the applicable Maturity Date extension request, and any such replacement Lender shall for all purposes constitute an Extending Lender. 
(d)    As a condition precedent to any extension pursuant to this Section 2.16, the Borrower shall deliver
to the Administrative Agent a certificate of the Borrower (i) certifying and attaching the resolutions adopted by the Borrower approving or consenting to such extension and (ii) certifying that, before and after

  50 





giving effect to such extension, (A) the representations and warranties of the Borrower contained in Article V or any other Loan Document, or which are contained in any document
furnished at any time under or in connection herewith or therewith, shall be true and correct in all material respects on and as of the date of such extension, except to the extent that such representations and warranties specifically refer to an
earlier date, in which case they shall be true and correct in all material respects as of such earlier date, and except that for purposes of this Section 2.16, the representations and warranties contained in Sections
5.05(a) and (b) shall be deemed to refer to the most recent statements furnished pursuant to Sections 6.01(a) and (b), respectively (provided, that, any representation and warranty that is qualified as to
materiality, Material Adverse Effect or similar language shall be true and correct (after giving effect to any qualification therein) in all respects), and (B) no Event of Default exists. 
(e)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the L/C Issuer shall not have its L/C Commitment extended beyond
the Existing Maturity Date without its consent.  (f)    This Section 2.16 shall supersede any
provisions in Section 2.13 or 10.01 to the contrary. 
Section 2.17    Increase in Aggregate Commitments. The Borrower may, upon prior written notice by
the Borrower to the Administrative Agent, increase the Aggregate Commitments (but not the Letter of Credit Sublimit or the Swing Line Sublimit) by a maximum aggregate amount for all such increases not to exceed $250,000,000, with additional
Commitments from any existing Lender or new Commitments from one or more other Persons selected by the Borrower and reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and the Swing Line Lender (so long as such Persons would be
Eligible Assignees); provided, that: (a) any such increase shall be in a minimum principal amount of $10,000,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof (or such other minimum and multiples as are agreed by the
Administrative Agent in its sole discretion); (b) at the time of such increase and after giving effect thereto: (i) no Default shall exist and be continuing, and (ii) the representations and warranties of the Borrower contained in
Article V or any other Loan Document, or which are contained in any document furnished at any time under or in connection herewith or therewith, shall be true and correct in all material respects on and as of the date of such increase, except
to the extent that such representations and warranties specifically refer to an earlier date, in which case they shall be true and correct in all material respects as of such earlier date, and except that for purposes of this
Section 2.17, the representations and warranties contained in Sections 5.05(a) and (b) shall be deemed to refer to the most recent statements furnished pursuant to Sections 6.01(a) and (b),
respectively (provided, that, any representation and warranty that is qualified as to materiality, Material Adverse Effect or similar language shall be true and correct (after giving effect to any qualification
therein) in all respects); (c) no existing Lender shall be under any obligation to increase its Commitment and any such decision whether to increase its Commitment shall be in such Lenders sole and absolute discretion; (d)(i) any new Lender
shall join this Agreement by executing such joinder documents as are required by the Administrative Agent, and/or (ii) any existing Lender electing to increase its Commitment shall have executed a commitment agreement reasonably satisfactory to
the Administrative Agent; and (e) the Borrower shall have delivered to the Administrative Agent a certificate of a Responsible Officer of the Borrower dated as of the date of such increase (i) certifying that (A) the conditions set
forth in clause (b) above have been met, and (B) attached thereto are resolutions adopted by the Borrower approving or consenting to such increase, and (ii) demonstrating that, upon giving effect to such increase on a pro forma
basis (and assuming for such calculation that such increase is fully drawn), the Borrower would be in compliance with the financial covenant set forth in Section 7.05 as of the most recently ended fiscal quarter of the
Borrower for which the Borrower was required to deliver financial statements pursuant to Section 6.01(a) or Section 6.01(b). The Borrower shall prepay any Committed Loans owing by it and
outstanding on the date of 

her Taxes by the
Borrower. The Borrower shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes. 
(c)    Tax Indemnifications. 
(i)    The Borrower shall, and does hereby, indemnify each Recipient, and shall make payment in respect thereof
within 10 days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 3.01) payable or paid by such
Recipient or required to be withheld or 
  52 





deducted from a payment to such Recipient, and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or
legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or the L/C Issuer (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the
Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or the L/C Issuer, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall, and does hereby, indemnify the Administrative Agent, and shall make payment in respect thereof within
10 days after demand therefor, for any amount which a Lender or the L/C Issuer for any reason fails to pay indefeasibly to the Administrative Agent as required pursuant to Section 3.01(c)(ii), except to the extent that such
amount is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Administrative Agent. To the extent that the Borrower pays an amount to the Administrative Agent pursuant to the
preceding sentence (a Back-Up Indemnity Payment), the Administrative Agent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to exercise its set-off rights
described in the last sentence of subsection (ii) below to collect the applicable Back-Up Indemnity Payment amount from the applicable Lender or the L/C Issuer and shall pay the amount so collected
to the Borrower net of any reasonable expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent in its efforts to collect (through set-off or otherwise) from such Lender or the L/C Issuer with respect to subsection
(ii) below.  (ii)    Each Lender and the L/C Issuer shall, and does hereby, severally indemnify, and
shall make payment in respect thereof within 10 days after demand therefor, (x) the Administrative Agent against any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender or the L/C Issuer (but only to the extent that the Borrower has not already
indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), (y) the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, as applicable, against any Taxes attributable to such Lenders failure
to comply with the provisions of Section 10.06(d) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (z) the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, as applicable, against any Excluded Taxes attributable to such
Lender or the L/C Issuer, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent or the Borrower in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were
correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender
and the L/C Issuer hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, under this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any amount due to
the Administrative Agent under this subsection (ii).  (d)    Evidence of Payments. Upon request by the Borrower or
the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, after any payment of Taxes by the Borrower or by the Administrative Agent to a Governmental Authority as provided in this Section 3.01, the Borrower shall deliver to the
Administrative Agent or the Administrative Agent shall deliver to the Borrower, as the case may be, the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of any return required by Laws to
report such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be. 
(e)    Status of Lenders; Tax Documentation. 
(i)    Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made
under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested

  53 





by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by
the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine
whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than
such documentation set forth in Section 3.01(e)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D)) shall not be required if in the Lenders reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender
to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender; provided, that, this sentence shall not apply to documentation described in
Section 3.01(e)(ii)(C) if such documentation is in substance essentially equivalent to, and not materially more onerous to provide, than the documentation set forth in Section 3.01(e)(ii)(A),
(ii)(B), or (ii)(D).  (ii)    Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that
the Borrower is a U.S. Person,  (A)    any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed copies of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax; 
(B)    any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the
Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:  (I)      in the case
of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or W-8BEN, as applicable) establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the interest article of such
tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or W-8BEN, as
applicable) establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the business profits or other income article of such tax treaty; 
(II)     executed copies of IRS Form W-8ECI, 
(III)    in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under
Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit G-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a bank within the meaning of
Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a 10 percent shareholder of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a controlled foreign corporation described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of
the Code (a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate) and (y) executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or W-8BEN, as
applicable); or 
  54 




(IV)    to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial
owner, executed copies of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form
W-8BEN-E (or W-8BEN, as applicable), a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit G-2 or Exhibit G-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable;
provided, that, if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate
substantially in the form of Exhibit G-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner; 
(C)    any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the
Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed copies of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary
documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and 
(D)    if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed
pursuant to FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting, registration or other requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver
to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed
by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under
FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lenders obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this subsection (D), FATCA shall
include any amendments made to FATCA after the Closing Date.  (iii)    Each Lender agrees that if any form or
certification it previously delivered pursuant to this Section 3.01 expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative
Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.  (f)    Treatment of Certain Refunds. Unless required by applicable
Laws, at no time shall the Administrative Agent have any obligation to file for or otherwise pursue on behalf of a Lender or the L/C Issuer, or have any obligation to pay to any Lender or the L/C Issuer, any refund of Taxes withheld or deducted from
funds paid for the account of such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be. If any Recipient determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the
Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 3.01, it shall pay to the Borrower an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments
made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section 3.01 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) incurred by such Recipient, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with
respect to such refund), provided, that, the Borrower, 
  55 





upon the request of the Recipient, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to
the Recipient in the event the Reci

 repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this subsection (f), in no event will the applicable Recipient be required to pay any amount
to the Borrower pursuant to this subsection (f) the payment of which would place the Recipient in a less favorable net after-Tax position than such Recipient would have been in if the Tax subject
to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This subsection (f) shall not be
construed to require any Recipient to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person. 
(g)    Survival. Each partys obligations under this Section 3.01 shall survive the
resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender or the L/C Issuer, the termination of the Aggregate Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other
Obligations.  Section 3.02    Illegality. If any Lender determines in good faith that any Law
has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to perform its obligations hereunder or make, maintain or fund or charge interest with respect to any Credit
Extension (whether denominated in Dollars or an Alternative Currency), or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars or any Alternative Currency
with respect to which such Lender has a Commitment hereunder in the applicable interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, (a) any obligation of such Lender to issue, make,
maintain, fund or charge interest with respect to such Credit Extension, to make or continue Eurocurrency Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies or, in the case of Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Dollars, to convert Base Rate
Committed Loans to Eurocurrency Rate Loans shall be suspended and (b) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or maintaining Base Rate Committed Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the Eurocurrency
Rate component of the Base Rate, the interest rate on which Base Rate Committed Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurocurrency Rate component of the
Base Rate, in each case until such Lender in good faith notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, (x) the Borrower shall, upon
demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable and such Loans are denominated in Dollars, convert all Eurocurrency Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Committed Loans (the interest rate on which Base
Rate Committed Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurocurrency Rate component of the Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period
therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Rate Loans and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality
of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Rate, the Administrative Agent shall, during the period of such suspension, compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the Eurocurrency Rate
component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Rate. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the
Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.05. 
  56 




Section 3.03    Inability to Determine Rates.
 (a)    If in connection with any request for a Eurocurrency Rate Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof, (i) the
Administrative Agent determines that (A) deposits (whether in Dollars or an Alternative Currency) are not being offered to banks in the applicable offshore interbank market for such currency for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such
Eurocurrency Rate Loan, (B)(1) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurocurrency Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurocurrency Rate Loan (whether denominated in Dollars or an Alternative
Currency) or in connection with an existing or proposed Base Rate Committed Loan, and (2) the circumstances described in Section 3.03(c)(i) do not apply, or (C) a fundamental change has occurred in the foreign
exchange or interbank markets with respect to an Alternative Currency (including changes in national or international financial, political or economic conditions or currency exchange rates or exchange controls) (in each case with respect to this
clause (i), Impacted Loans), or (ii) the Required Lenders determine for any reason the Eurocurrency Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurocurrency Rate Loan does not adequately and
fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, (x) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurocurrency Rate Loans in the
affected currency or currencies shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Interest Periods), and (y) in the event of a determination described in the preceding sentence with respect to the Eurocurrency Rate
component of the Base Rate, the utilization of the Eurocurrency Rate component in determining the Base Rate shall be suspended, in each case until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon
receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Committed Borrowing of, or a conversion to or a continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies (to the extent of the affected Eurocurrency Rate
Loans or Interest Periods) or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Committed Loans in the amount specified therein. 
(b)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Administrative Agent has made the determination described in
Section 3.03(a)(i), the Administrative Agent, in consultation with the Borrower and the affected Lenders, may establish an alternative interest rate for the Impacted Loans, in which case, such alternative rate of interest
shall apply with respect to the Impacted Loans until (i) the Administrative Agent revokes the notice delivered with respect to the Impacted Loans under Section 3.03(a)(i), (ii) the Administrative Agent or the Required
Lenders notify the Borrower that such alternative interest rate does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding the Impacted Loans, or (iii) any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any
Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to such alternative rate of interest or to determine or charge
interest rates based upon such rate or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to do any of the foregoing and provides the Administrative Agent and the Borrower written notice thereof. 
(c)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other Loan Documents, but without limiting
Section 3.03(a) and Section 3.03(b), if the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto absent manifest error), or the Borrower or
the Required Lenders notify the Administrative Agent (with, in the case of the Required Lenders, a copy to the Borrower) that the Borrower or the Required Lenders (as applicable) have determined (which determination likewise shall be conclusive and
binding upon all parties hereto absent manifest error), that: (i) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining LIBOR for any requested Interest Period, including because the LIBOR Screen Rate is not available or published on a
current basis and such circumstances are unlikely to be temporary; or (ii) the administrator of the LIBOR Screen Rate or a Governmental Authority having or purporting to have jurisdiction over the Administrative Agent has

  57 





made a public statement identifying a specific date after which LIBOR or the LIBOR Screen Rate shall no longer be made available, or used for determining the interest rate of loans in the
applicable currency; provided, that, at the time of such statement, there is no successor administrator that is reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent that will continue to provide LIBOR after such specific date (such
specific date, th

LIBOR in accordance with this Section 3.03(c) with (x) in the case of Committed Loans denominated in Dollars, one or
more SOFR-Based Rates, or (y) another alternate benchmark rate giving due consideration to any evolving or then-existing convention for similar syndicated credit facilities for such alternative benchmarks and, in each case, including any
mathematical or other adjustments to such benchmark giving due consideration to any evolving or then-existing convention for similar syndicated credit facilities for such benchmarks, which adjustment or method for calculating such adjustment shall
be published on an information service as selected by the Administrative Agent from time to time in its reasonable discretion and may be periodically updated (the Adjustment; and any such proposed rate, a LIBOR Successor
Rate), and any such amendment shall become effective at 5:00 p.m. on the fifth Business Day after the Administrative Agent shall have posted such proposed amendment to all Lenders and the Borrower unless, prior to such time, Lenders
comprising the Required Lenders have delivered to the Administrative Agent written notice that such Required Lenders (A) in the case of an amendment to replace LIBOR with a rate described in clause (x) above, object to the
Adjustment, or (B) in the case of an amendment to replace LIBOR with a rate described in clause (y) above, object to such amendment; provided, that, for the avoidance of doubt, in the case of subsection
(A) above, the Required Lenders shall not be entitled to object to any SOFR-Based Rate contained in any such amendment. Such LIBOR Successor Rate shall be applied in a manner consistent with market practice; provided, that, to
the extent such market practice is not administratively feasible for the Administrative Agent, such LIBOR Successor Rate shall be applied in a manner as otherwise reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent. 
If no LIBOR Successor Rate has been determined and the circumstances under Section 3.03(c)(i) exist or the Scheduled
Unavailability Date has occurred (as applicable), the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, (i) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurocurrency Rate Loans shall be suspended (to
the extent of the affected Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Interest Periods), and (ii) the Eurocurrency Rate component shall no longer be utilized in determining the Base Rate. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request
for a Committed Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans (to the extent of the affected Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Interest Periods) or, failing that, in the case of a request for Committed Loans denominated in Dollars,
will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Committed Loans (subject to the foregoing subsection (ii)) in the amount specified therein. Notwithstanding anything else herein, any
definition of LIBOR Successor Rate shall provide that in no event shall such LIBOR Successor Rate be less than zero for purposes of this Agreement. In connection with the implementation of a LIBOR Successor Rate, the Administrative Agent will have
the right to make LIBOR Successor Rate Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such LIBOR Successor Rate Conforming Changes will become
effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement; provided, that, with respect to any such amendment effected, the Administrative Agent shall post each such amendment implementing such LIBOR
Successor Conforming Changes to the Lenders reasonably promptly after such amendment becomes effective. 
  58 




Section 3.04    Increased Costs 
(a)    Increased Costs Generally. If any Change in Law shall: 
(i)    impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar
requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement contemplated by Section 3.04(d)) or the L/C Issuer; 
(ii)    subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes and (B) Excluded Taxes) on its
loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; or 
(iii)    impose on any Lender or the L/C Issuer or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense
affecting this Agreement or Eurocurrency Rate Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;  and the result of any of the foregoing
shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan), or to increase the cost to such Lender or the L/C Issuer of participating in, issuing
or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of Credit), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or the L/C Issuer hereunder (whether of principal,
interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender or the L/C Issuer, the Borrower will pay to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the
case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.  (b)    Capital Requirements. If any Lender or the
L/C Issuer reasonably determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or the L/C Issuer or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lenders or the L/C Issuers holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements
has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lenders or the L/C Issuers capital or on the capital of such Lenders or the L/C Issuers holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the
Commitment of such Lender or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit or Swing Line Loans held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the L/C Issuer, to a level below that which such Lender or the L/C Issuer or such
Lenders or the L/C Issuers holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lenders or the L/C Issuers policies and the policies of such Lenders or the L/C Issuers
holding company with respect to capital adequacy and liquidity), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer or
such Lenders or the L/C Issuers holding company for any such reduction suffered.  (c)    Certificates for
Reimbursement. A certificate of a Lender or the L/C Issuer setting forth in reasonable detail calculation of the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in
subsection (a) or (b) of this Section 3.04 and delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, the amount
shown as due on any such certificate within ten (10) days after receipt thereof.  (d)    Reserves on Eurocurrency Rate
Loans. The Borrower shall pay to each Lender, (i) as long as such Lender shall be required by the FRB to maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including eurocurrency funds or deposits (currently known as
Eurocurrency liabilities), additional interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Eurocurrency Rate Loan equal to the actual costs 
  59 





of such reserves allocated to such Eurocurrency Rate Loan by such Lender (as reasonably determined by such Lender), and (ii) as long as such Lender shall be required to comply with any
reserve ratio requirement or analogous requirement of the FRB imposed in respect of the maintenance of any Commitment or the funding of Committed Loans, such additional costs (expressed as a percentage per annum and rounded upwards, if necessary, to
the nearest five decimal places) equal to the actual costs allocated to such Commitment or such Committed Loan by such Lender (as reasonably determined by such Lender), which in each case shall be due and payable on each date on which interest is
payable on such Loan; provided, that, the Borrower shall have received at least ten (10) days prior notice (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of such additional interest or costs from such Lender. If a Lender fails to
give notice ten (10) days prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date, such additional interest shall be due and payable ten (10) days from receipt of such notice. 
(e)    Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the L/C Issuer to demand compensation pursuant to the
foregoing provisions of this Section 3.04 shall not constitute a waiver of such Lenders or the L/C Issuers right to demand such compensation; provided, that, the Borrower shall not be required to
compensate a Lender or the L/C Issuer pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.04 for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than six (6) months prior to the date that such Lender or the
L/C Issuer, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lenders or the L/C Issuers intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in
Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the six-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof). 
Section 3.05    Compensation for Losses. Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the
Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss (other than loss of Applicable Rate), cost or expense incurred by it as a result of: 
(a)    any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan other than a Base Rate Committed Loan on a day
other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise); 
(b)    any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay,
borrow, continue or convert any Loan other than a Base Rate Committed Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower; 
(c)    any failure by the Borrower to make payment of any Committed Loan or drawing under any Letter of Credit (or
interest due thereon) denominated in an Alternative Currency on its scheduled due date or any payment thereof in a different currency; or 
(d)    any assignment of a Eurocurrency Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as
a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 10.13;  excluding any loss of anticipated profits and including any loss or
expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained. The Borrower shall also pay any customary administrative fees
charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing.  For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under this
Section 3.05, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Eurocurrency Rate Loan made by it at the Eurocurrency Rate used in determining the Eurocurrency Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in
the offshore interbank market for such currency for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Eurocurrency Rate Loan was in fact so funded.

Section 3.06    Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders 
(a)    Designation of a Different Lending Office. If any Lender requests compensation under
Section 3.04, or requires the Borrower to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender, the L/C Issuer or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender or the L/C Issuer pursuant to
Section 3.01, or if any Lender gives a notice pursuant to Section 3.02, then at the request of the Borrower such Lender or the L/C Issuer shall, as applicable, use reasonable efforts to designate a
different Lending Office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender or the L/C Issuer, such designation or
assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.01 or 3.04, as the case may be, in the future, or eliminate the need for the notice pursuant to
Section 3.02, as applicable, and (ii) in each case, would not subject such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender or
the L/C Issuer, as the case may be. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender or the L/C Issuer in connection with any such designation or assignment. 
(b)    Replacement of Lenders. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.04, or if the
Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.01 and, in each case, such Lender has declined or is
unable to designate a different lending office in accordance with Section 3.06(a), the Borrower may replace such Lender in accordance with Section 10.13. 
Section 3.07    Survival. All of the Borrowers obligations under this Article III
shall survive termination of the Aggregate Commitments, repayment of all other Obligations hereunder, and resignation of the Administrative Agent.

amount (including undrawn committed or available amounts and including amounts owing to all creditors under any combined or syndicated credit arrangement) of more than the Threshold Amount, or (B) fails to observe or perform any other agreement
or condition relating to any such Indebtedness or Guarantee described in the preceding subsection (A) or contained in any instrument or agreement evidencing, securing or relating thereto, or any other event occurs, the effect of which

enforceability of the Loan Documents; or the Borrower denies that it has any or further liability or obligation under the Loan Documents, or purports to revoke, terminate or rescind the Loan Documents; or 
(k)    Change of Control. There occurs any Change of Control. 
Section 8.02    Remedies Upon Event of Default. If any Event of Default occurs and is continuing,
the Administrative Agent shall, at the request of, or may, with the consent of, the Required Lenders, take any or all of the following actions: 
(a)    declare the commitment of each Lender to make Loans and any obligation of the L/C Issuer to make L/C Credit Extensions to be
terminated, whereupon such commitments and obligation shall be terminated;  (b)    declare the unpaid principal amount of all
outstanding Loans, all interest accrued and unpaid thereon, and all other amounts owing or payable hereunder or under any other Loan Document to be immediately due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of
which are hereby expressly waived by the Borrower; 
  75 




(c)    require that the Borrower Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations (in an
amount equal to the Minimum Collateral Amount with respect thereto); and  (d)    exercise on behalf of itself, the Lenders and
the L/C Issuer all rights and remedies available to it, the Lenders and the L/C Issuer under the Loan Documents;  provided, that, upon the occurrence
of an actual or deemed entry of an order for relief with respect to the Borrower under the Bankruptcy Code of the United States, the obligation of each Lender to make Loans and any obligation of the L/C Issuer to make L/C Credit Extensions shall
automatically terminate, the unpaid principal amount of all outstanding Loans and all interest and other amounts as aforesaid shall automatically become due and payable, and the obligation of the Borrower to Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations as
aforesaid shall automatically become effective, in each case without further act of the Administrative Agent or any Lender. 
Section 8.03    Application of Funds. After the exercise of remedies provided for in
Section 8.02 (or after the Loans have automatically become immediately due and payable and the L/C Obligations have automatically been required to be Cash Collateralized as set forth in the proviso to
Section 8.02), or if at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all Obligations then due hereunder, any amounts received on account of the Obligations shall be
applied by the Administrative Agent in the following order:  First, to payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting fees,
indemnities, expenses and other amounts (including reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of counsel to the Administrative Agent and amounts payable under Article III) payable to the Administrative Agent in its capacity as such; 
Second, to payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting fees, indemnities and other amounts (other than principal, interest and Letter
of Credit Fees) payable to the Lenders and the L/C Issuer (including reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of counsel to the respective Lenders and the L/C Issuer to the extent the Borrower is obligated to reimburse such amounts and amounts
payable under Article III), ratably among them in proportion to the respective amounts described in this clause Second payable to them; 
Third, to payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting accrued and unpaid Letter of Credit Fees and interest on the Loans, L/C
Borrowings and other Obligations, ratably among the Lenders and the L/C Issuer in proportion to the respective amounts described in this clause Third payable to them; 
Fourth, to payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting unpaid principal of the Loans and L/C Borrowings, ratably among the Lenders
and the L/C Issuer in proportion to the respective amounts described in this clause Fourth held by them;  Fifth, to the Administrative
Agent, for the account of the L/C Issuer, to Cash Collateralize that portion of L/C Obligations comprised of the aggregate undrawn amount of Letters of Credit; and 
Last, the balance, if any, after all of the Obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full, to the Borrower or as otherwise required by Law.
 Subject to Section 2.03(c) and Section 2.14, amounts used to Cash Collateralize the aggregate
undrawn amount of Letters of Credit pursuant to clause Fifth above shall be applied to satisfy drawings 
  76 





under such Letters of Credit as they occur. If any amount remains on deposit as Cash Collateral after all Letters of Credit have either been fully drawn or expired, such remaining amount shall be
applied to the other Obligations, if any, in the order set forth above.  ARTICLE IX. 
ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT 
Section 9.01    Appointment and Authority. Each of the Lenders and the L/C Issuer hereby
irrevocably appoints Bank of America to act on its behalf as the Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are
delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Except with respect to Sections 9.06, the provisions of this Article are solely for the benefit
of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuer, and the Borrower shall not have rights as a third party beneficiary of any of such provisions. It is understood and agreed that the use of the term agent herein or in any other
Loan Documents (or any other similar term) with reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable Law. Instead such term is used
as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting parties. 
Section 9.02    Rights as a Lender. The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall
have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent and the term Lender or Lenders shall, unless otherwise expressly
indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, own securities of, act as the
financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and without any duty to
account therefor to the Lenders.  Section 9.03    Exculpatory Provisions. Neither the
Administrative Agent nor the Arranger shall have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, and each such Persons duties hereunder shall be administrative in nature. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, neither the Administrative Agent nor the Arranger:  (a)    shall be subject to any fiduciary or
other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing;  (b)    shall have any duty to take any
discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the
Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents); provided, that, the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in
its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law, including for the avoidance of doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay
under any Debtor Relief Law or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any Debtor Relief Law; or 
(c)    shall, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, have any duty to disclose, any credit or other
information concerning the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition or creditworthiness of the Borrower or any of its Affiliates that is 
  77 





communicated to, or in the possession of, the Administrative Agent, the Arranger or any of their Related Parties in any capacity, except for notices, reports and other documents expressly
required to be furnished to the Lenders or the L/C Issuer by the Administrative Agent herein.  Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its
Related Parties shall be liable for any action taken or not taken by the Administrative Agent under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (i) with the consent or at
the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Sections 10.01
and 8.02) or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment. Any such action taken or failure to act pursuant to the foregoing
shall be binding on all Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until notice describing such Default is given in writing to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower, a Lender or the L/C
Issuer.  Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its Related Parties have any duty or obligation to any Lender or participant or any other
Person to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder
or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default, (iv) the validity,
enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document or (vi) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, other
than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent. 
Section 9.04    Reliance by Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to
rely upon, and shall be fully protected in relying and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, communication, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message,
Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by
telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall be fully protected in relying and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, or
the issuance, extension, renewal, or increase of a Letter of Credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or the L/C Issuer, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender or
the L/C Issuer unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender or the L/C Issuer prior to the making of such Loan or the issuance, extension, renewal, or increase of such Letter of Credit. The
Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any
such counsel, accountants or experts.  Section 9.05    Delegation of Duties. The Administrative
Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub agent
may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative
Agent and any such sub agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall not be
responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any sub-agents except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and non-appealable
judgment that the Administrative Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such sub-agents. 
  78 




Section 9.06    Resignation of Administrative
Agent.  (a)    The Administrative Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders, the L/C Issuer and the
Borrower. Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, with approval of the Borrower, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed and which shall not be required if a Default or Event of
Default has occurred and is then continuing, to appoint a successor, which shall be a bank with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States. If no such successor shall have been appointed by
the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the
Resignation Effective Date), then the retiring Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) on behalf of the Lenders and the L/C Issuer, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth
above; provided, that, in no event shall any successor Administrative Agent be a Defaulting Lender. Whether or not a successor has been appointed, such resignation shall become effective in accordance with such notice on the
Resignation Effective Date.  (b)    If the Person serving as Administrative Agent is a Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause
(d) of the definition thereof, the Required Lenders may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law by notice in writing to the Borrower and such Person remove such Person as the Administrative Agent and, in consultation with the Borrower,
appoint a successor. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the
Removal Effective Date), then such removal shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice on the Removal Effective Date. 
(c)    With effect from the Resignation Effective Date or the Removal Effective Date (as applicable) (i) the
retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and (ii) except for any indemnity payments or other amounts then owed to the retiring or removed
Administrative Agent, all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender and the L/C Issuer directly, until such time, if any, as the Required
Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided for above. Upon the acceptance of a successors appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers,
privileges and duties of the retiring or removed Administrative Agent (other than as provided in Section 3.01(g) and other than any rights to indemnity payments or other amounts owed to the retiring or removed
Administrative Agent as of the Resignation Effective Date or the Removal Effective Date, as applicable), and the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan
Documents (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this Section 9.06(c)). The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless
otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After the retiring or removed Administrative Agents resignation or removal hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article and
Section 10.04 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring or removed Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions
taken or omitted to be taken by any of them (i) while the retiring or removed Administrative Agent was acting as Administrative Agent and (ii) after such resignation or removal for as long as any of them continues to act in any capacity
hereunder or under the other Loan Documents, including in respect of any actions taken in connection with transferring the agency to any successor Administrative Agent. 
  79 




Any resignation by or removal of Bank of America as Administrative Agent pursuant to this
Section 9.06 shall also constitute its resignation or removal as the L/C Issuer and the Swing Line Lender. If Bank of America resigns as the L/C Issuer, it shall retain all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the
L/C Issuer hereunder with respect to all Letters of Credit outstanding as of the effective date of its resignation as the L/C Issuer and all L/C Obligations with respect thereto, including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Committed
Loans or fund risk participations in Unreimbursed Amounts pursuant to Section 2.03(c). If Bank of America resigns as the Swing Line Lender, it shall retain all the rights of the Swing Line Lender provided for hereunder with
respect to Swing Line Loans made by it and outstanding as of the effective date of such resignation, including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Committed Loans or fund risk participations in outstanding Swing Line Loans pursuant to
Section 2.04(c). Upon the appointment by the Borrower of a successor L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender hereunder (which successor shall in all cases be a Lender other than a Defaulting Lender) and acceptance of the
appointment by such successor, (a) such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender, as applicable (b) the retiring L/C Issuer and Swing
Line Lender shall be discharged from all of their respective duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents, and (c) the successor L/C Issuer shall issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any,
outstanding at the time of such succession or make other arrangements satisfactory to Bank of America to effectively assume the obligations of Bank of America with respect to such Letters of Credit. 
Section 9.07    Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent, Arranger
and Other Lenders. Each Lender and the L/C Issuer expressly acknowledges that neither the Administrative Agent nor the Arranger has made any representation or warranty to it, and that no act by the Administrative Agent or the Arranger hereafter
taken, including any consent to, and acceptance of any assignment or review of the affairs of the Borrower or any Affiliate thereof, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by the Administrative Agent or the Arranger to any
Lender or the L/C Issuer as to any matter, including whether the Administrative Agent or the Arranger has disclosed material information in their (or their Related Parties) possession. Each Lender and the L/C Issuer represents to the
Administrative Agent and the Arranger that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, the Arranger, any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed
appropriate, made its own credit analysis of, appraisal of, and investigation into, the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, and all applicable bank or
other regulatory Laws relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, and made its own decision to enter into this Agreement and to extend credit to the Borrower hereunder. Each Lender and the L/C Issuer also acknowledges that it will,
independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, the Arranger, any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own
credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder, and to make such investigations as it
deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower. Each Lender and the L/C Issuer represents and warrants that (a) the Loan Documents set
forth the terms of a commercial lending facility and (b) it is engaged in making, acquiring or holding commercial loans in the ordinary course and is entering into this Agreement as a Lender or the L/C Issuer for the purpose of making,
acquiring or holding commercial loans and providing other facilities set forth herein as may be applicable to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, and not for the purpose of purchasing, acquiring or holding any other type of financial instrument, and each
Lender and the L/C Issuer agrees not to assert a claim in contravention of the foregoing. Each Lender and the L/C Issuer represents and warrants that it is sophisticated with respect to decisions to make, acquire and/or hold commercial loans and to
provide other facilities set forth herein, as may be applicable to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, and either it, or the Person exercising discretion in making its decision to make, acquire and/or hold such commercial loans or to provide such other
facilities, is experienced in making, acquiring or holding such commercial loans or providing such other facilities. 
  80 




Section 9.08    No Other Duties, Etc. Anything
herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none of the bookrunner, the arranger or any co-syndication agent shall have any powers, duties or responsibilities under this Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents, except in its capacity, as applicable, as the Administrative Agent, a Lender or the L/C Issuer hereunder. 
Section 9.09    Administrative Agent May File Proofs of Claim. In case of the pendency of any
receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding relative to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan or L/C
Obligation shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such
proceeding or otherwise: (a) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans, L/C Obligations and all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other
documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders, the L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders, the L/C
Issuer and the Administrative Agent and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders, the L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.03(h) and (i), 2.09 and 10.04) allowed in
such judicial proceeding; and (b) to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same; and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other
similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender and the L/C Issuer to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments
directly to the Lenders and the L/C Issuer, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the
Administrative Agent under Sections 2.09 and 10.04. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender or the L/C Issuer any plan of
reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Lender or the L/C Issuer or to authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender or the L/C Issuer in any such
proceeding.  Section 9.10    Certain ERISA Matters.

in connection with this Agreement or (y) result from a claim brought by the Borrower against an Indemnitee for material breach of such Indemnitees obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document, if the Borrower has obtained a
final and nonappealable judgment in its favor on such claim as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. Without limiting the provisions of Section 3.01(c), this Section 10.04(b) shall not
apply with respect to Taxes other than any Taxes that represent losses, claims, damages, etc. arising from any non-Tax claim.

under subsection (a) or (b) of this Section 10.04 to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent (or any sub-agent thereof), the L/C Issuer, the Swing Line Lender or
any Related Party of any of the foregoing, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent), the L/C Issuer, the Swing Line Lender or such Related Party, as the case may

Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof. No Indemnitee referred to in subsection (b) above shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by unintended recipients of any information or other materials distributed to such
unintended recipients by such Indemnitee through telecommunications, electronic or other information transmission systems in connection with this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby other

such setoff or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or such Lender in its
discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or otherwise, then (a) to the extent of such recovery, the obligation or part thereof originally intended to be

Overnight Rate from time to time in effect, in the applicable currency of such recovery or payment. The obligations of the Lenders and the L/C Issuer under clause (b) of the preceding sentence shall survive the payment in full of the
Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.  Section 10.06    Successors and Assigns

Agent or, if Trade Date is specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade Date, shall not be less than $5,000,000 unless each of the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing,
the Borrower otherwise consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). 
(ii)    Proportionate Amounts. Each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part

(v)    No Assignment to Certain Persons. No such assignment shall be made to (A) the Borrower or any of
the Borrowers Affiliates or Subsidiaries, (B) to any Defaulting Lender or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Person who, upon becoming a Lender hereunder, would constitute any of the foregoing Persons described in this subsection
(B) or (C) to a natural Person (or a holding company, investment vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated for, the primary benefit of a natural Person). 
(vi)    Certain Additional Payments. In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any
Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments to the Administrative Agent in an
aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee 
  90 





of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with the consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Loans
previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the
Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or any Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon) and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro rata share of all Loans and participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans in
accordance with its Applicable Percentage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under applicable Law without compliance with the
provisions of this subsection (vi), then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs.

Section 10.06, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and
Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement
(and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections
3.01, 3.04, 3.05, and 10.04 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment; provided, that, except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected
parties, no assignment by a Defaulting Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from the Lenders having been a Defaulting Lender. Upon request, the Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and
deliver a Note to the assignee Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this subsection (b) shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such
Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with subsection (d) of this Section 10.06. 
(c)    Register. The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as a
non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower (and such agency being solely for tax purposes), shall maintain at the Administrative Agents Office a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it (or the
equivalent thereof in electronic form) and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts (and stated interest) of the Loans and L/C Obligations owing to, each Lender pursuant
to the terms hereof from time to time (the Register). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded
in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender and the owner of the amounts owing to it under the Loan Documents as reflected in the Register for all purposes of the Loan Documents. The Register shall be available for inspection by the
Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. 
(d)    Participations. Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, the Borrower, the Administrative
Agent, the L/C Issuer or the Swing Line Lender, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural Person (or a holding company, investment vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated for, the primary benefit of a natural Person), a Defaulting
Lender or the Borrower or any of the Borrowers Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a Participant) in all or a portion of such Lenders rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its
Commitment and/or the Loans (including such Lenders participations in L/C Obligations and/or Swing Line Loans) owing to it); provided, that, (i) such Lenders obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged,
(ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the 
  91 





Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the other Lenders and the L/C Issuer shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lenders rights and obligations
under this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, each Lender shall be responsible for the indemnity under Section 10.04(c) without regard to the existence of any participation. 
Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce
this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided, that, such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree
to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in Section 10.01(a) that affects such Participant. The Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04
and 3.05 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section 10.06 (it being understood that the documentation required under
Section 3.01(e) shall be delivered to the Lender who sells the participation) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of this
Section 10.06; provided, that, such Participant (A) agrees to be subject to the provisions of Sections 3.06 and 10.13 as if it were an assignee under subsection (b) of this
Section 10.06 and (B) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 3.01 or 3.04, with respect to any participation, than the Lender from whom it acquired the applicable
participation would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment under Section 3.01 or 3.04 results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired
the applicable participation. Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at the Borrowers request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrower to effectuate the provisions of Section 3.06
with respect to any Participant. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.08 as though it were a Lender; provided, that, such Participant
agrees to be subject to Section 2.13 as though it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a nonfiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters
the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participants interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the Participant Register); provided,
that, no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participants interest in any commitments, loans, letters of
credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded
in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have
no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.  (e)    Certain Pledges. Any Lender may at any time pledge or
assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank;
provided, that, no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. 
(f)    Resignation as L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender after Assignment. 
(i)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if at any time Bank of America assigns all of its
Commitment and Loans pursuant to subsection (b) above, Bank of America may, upon thirty (30) days notice to the Borrower and the Lenders, resign as the L/C Issuer. In the event of any such resignation as the L/C Issuer,

  92 





the Borrower shall be entitled to appoint from among the Lenders a successor L/C Issuer hereunder; provided, that, no failure by the Borrower to appoint any such successor shall
affect the resignation of the L/C Issuer. If Bank of America resigns as the L/C Issuer, it shall retain all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the L/C Issuer hereunder with respect to all Letters of Credit outstanding as of the effective
date of its resignation as the L/C Issuer and all L/C Obligations with respect thereto (including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Committed Loans or fund risk participations in Unreimbursed Amounts pursuant to
Section 2.03(c)). Upon the appointment of a successor L/C Issuer and acceptance of the appointment by such successor L/C Issuer, (a) such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers,
privileges and duties of the retiring L/C Issuer, and (b) the successor L/C Issuer shall issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession or make other arrangements
satisfactory to the retiring L/C Issuer to effectively assume the obligations of the retiring L/C Issuer with respect to such Letters of Credit. 
(ii)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if at any time Bank of America assigns all of its
Commitment and Loans pursuant to subsection (b) above, Bank of America may, upon thirty (30) days notice to the Borrower, resign as Swing Line Lender. In the event of any such resignation as Swing Line Lender, the Borrower
shall be entitled to appoint from among the Lenders a successor Swing Line Lender hereunder; provided, that, no failure by the Borrower to appoint any such successor shall affect the resignation of Bank of America as Swing Line Lender.
If Bank of America resigns as Swing Line Lender, it shall retain all the rights of the Swing Line Lender provided for hereunder with respect to Swing Line Loans made by it and outstanding as of the effective date of such resignation, including the
right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Committed Loans or fund risk participations in outstanding Swing Line Loans pursuant to Section 2.04(c). Upon the appointment of a successor Swing Line Lender and acceptance of
the appointment by such successor Swing Line Lender, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Swing Line Lender, as the case may be. 
Section 10.07    Treatment of Certain Information; Confidentiality. Each of the Arranger, the
Administrative Agent, each of the Lenders and the L/C Issuer agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its Affiliates, its auditors and to its and its
Affiliates Related Parties (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the extent required
or requested by any regulatory authority purporting to have jurisdiction over such Person or its Related Parties (including any self-regulatory authority, such as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners), (c) to the extent required by
applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to any other party hereto, (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or under any other Loan Document or any action or proceeding relating
to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereund

bstantially the same as those of this Section 10.07, to
(i) any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights and obligations under this Agreement or (ii) any actual or prospective party (or its Related Parties) to any swap, derivative or
other transaction under which payments are to be made by reference to the Borrower and its obligations, this Agreement or payments hereunder, (g) on a confidential basis to (i) any rating agency in connection with rating the Borrower or
its Subsidiaries or the credit facilities provided hereunder or (ii) the CUSIP Service Bureau or any similar agency in connection with the issuance and monitoring of CUSIP numbers or other market identifiers with respect to the credit
facilities provided hereunder, (h) with the consent of the Borrower or (i) to the extent such Information (x) becomes publicly 
  93 





available other than as a result of a breach of this Section 10.07, (y) becomes available to the Arranger, the Administrative Agent, any Lender, the L/C Issuer or any of
their respective Affiliates on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrower, or (z) is independently discovered or developed by a party hereto without utilizing any Information received from the Borrower or violating the terms
of this Section 10.07. In addition, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may disclose the existence of this Agreement and information about this Agreement to market data collectors, similar service providers to the
lending industry and service providers to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in connection with the administration of this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, and the Commitments. 
For purposes of this Section 10.07, Information means all information received from the Borrower or any
Subsidiary relating to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or any of their respective businesses, other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure
by the Borrower or any Subsidiary. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section 10.07 shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has
exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information. 
Each of the Administrative Agent, each of the Lenders and the L/C Issuer acknowledges that (a) the Information may include material non-public information concerning the Borrower or a Subsidiary, as the case may be, (b) it has developed compliance procedures regarding the use of material non-public
information and (c) it will handle such material non-public information in accordance with applicable Law, including United States Federal and state securities Laws. 
Section 10.08    Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing,
each Lender, the L/C Issuer and each of their respective Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or
demand, provisional or final, in whatever currency) at any time held and other obligations (in whatever currency) at any time owing by such Lender, the L/C Issuer or any such Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower against any
and all of the obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Agreement or any other Loan Document to such Lender or the L/C Issuer or their respective Affiliates, irrespective of whether or not such Lender, the L/C Issuer or
Affiliate shall have made any demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and although such obligations of the Borrower may be contingent or unmatured or are owed to a branch office or Affiliate of such Lender or the L/C Issuer different
from the branch office or Affiliate holding such deposit or obligated on such indebtedness; provided, that, in the event that any Defaulting Lender shall exercise any such right of setoff, (x) all amounts so set off shall be paid
over immediately to the Administrative Agent for further application in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.15 and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed
held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and the Lenders and (y) the Defaulting Lender shall provide promptly to the Administrative Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the Obligations owing to such
Defaulting Lender as to which it exercised such right of setoff. The rights of each Lender, the L/C Issuer and their respective Affiliates under this Section 10.08 are in addition to other rights and remedies (including
other rights of setoff) that such Lender, the L/C Issuer or their respective Affiliates may have. Each Lender and the L/C Issuer agrees to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent promptly after any such setoff and application,
provided, that, the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application. 
Section 10.09    Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
any Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid under the Loan Documents shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious interest permitted by applicable Law (the Maximum Rate).
If the Administrative Agent or any Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, 
  94 





the excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the Borrower. In determining whether the interest contracted for, charged,
or received by the Administrative Agent or a Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather than interest,
(b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the Obligations hereunder. 
Section 10.10    Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. This Agreement and each of the other
Loan Documents may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto in different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement, the
other Loan Documents and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the Administrative Agent or the L/C Issuer constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all
previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. Except as provided in Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the
Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof that, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this
Agreement by fax transmission or e-mail transmission (e.g., pdf or tif) shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement or such other Loan Document
or certificate. Without limiting the foregoing, to the extent a manually executed counterpart is not specifically required to be delivered under the terms of any Loan Document, upon the request of any party, such fax transmission or e-mail transmission shall be promptly followed by such manually executed counterpart. 
Section 10.11    Survival of Representations and Warranties. All representations and warranties
made hereunder and in any other Loan Document or other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and thereof. Such representations and warranties have been or
will be relied upon by the Administrative Agent and each Lender, regardless of any investigation made by the Administrative Agent or any Lender or on their behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or
knowledge of any Default at the time of any Credit Extension, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as any Loan or any other Obligation hereunder shall remain unpaid or unsatisfied or any Letter of Credit shall remain outstanding. 
Section 10.12    Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents is
held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, (a) the legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall not be affected or impaired thereby and (b) the parties shall
endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions. The invalidity
of a provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this Section 10.12, if and to the extent that
the enforceability of any provisions in this Agreement relating to Defaulting Lenders shall be limited by Debtor Relief Laws, as determined in good faith by the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or the Swing Line Lender, as applicable, then such
provisions shall be deemed to be in effect only to the extent not so limited. 
Section 10.13    Replacement of Lenders. If the Borrower is entitled to replace a Lender pursuant
to the provisions of Section 3.06, or if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender or a Non-Consenting Lender, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such
Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 10.06), all of its
interests, rights (other than its 
  95 





existing rights to payments pursuant to Sections 3.01 and 3.04) and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an Eligible Assignee that shall assume such
obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided, that: 
(a)    the Borrower shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the assignment fee (if any) specified in
Section 10.06(b);  (b)    such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to
one hundred percent (100%) of the outstanding principal of its Loans and L/C Advances, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under
Section 3.05) from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts); 
(c)    in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under
Section 3.04 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 3.01, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter; 
(d)    such assignment does not conflict with applicable Laws; and 
(e)    in the case of any such assignment resulting from a Non-Consenting
Lenders failure to consent to a proposed change, waiver, discharge or termination with respect to any Loan Document, the applicable replacement bank, financial institution or Fund consents to the proposed change, waiver, discharge or
termination.  A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or
otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. Each party hereto agrees that (i) an assignment required pursuant to this Section 10.13 may be effected
pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption executed by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the assignee and (ii) the Lender required to make such assignment need not be a party thereto in order for such assignment to be effective and shall
be deemed to have consented to an be bound by the terms thereof; provided, that, following the effectiveness of any such assignment, the other parties to such assignment agree to execute and deliver such documents necessary to evidence
such assignment as reasonably requested by the applicable Lender; provided, further, that, any such documents shall be without recourse to or warranty by the parties thereto. Notwithstanding anything in this
Section 10.13 to the contrary, (A) the Lender that acts as the L/C Issuer may not be replaced hereunder at any time it has any Letter of Credit outstanding hereunder unless arrangements satisfactory to such Lender
(including the furnishing of a backstop letter of credit in form and substance, and issued by an issuer, reasonably satisfactory to the L/C Issuer or the depositing of Cash Collateral pursuant to arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the L/C
Issuer) have been made with respect to such outstanding Letter of Credit and (B) the Lender that acts as the Administrative Agent may not be replaced hereunder except in accordance with the terms of Section 9.06. 
Section 10.14    Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Etc 
(a)    GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS AND ANY CLAIMS, CONTROVERSY, DISPUTE OR CAUSE OF ACTION
BASED UPON, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT (EXCEPT, AS TO ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT, AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH THEREIN) AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND THEREBY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. 
  96 




(b)    SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION. THE BORROWER IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY AGREES THAT IT WILL NOT COMMENCE ANY ACTION, LITIGATION OR PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND OR DESCRIPTION, WHETHER IN LAW OR EQUITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR IN TORT OR OTHERWISE, AGAINST THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, ANY LENDER, THE L/C ISSUER, OR

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT OF THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, SITTING IN THE COUNTY OF NEW YORK, AND ANY APPELLATE COURT FROM ANY THEREOF, AND EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY SUBMITS TO THE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS
AND AGREES THAT ALL CLAIMS IN RESPECT OF ANY SUCH ACTION, LITIGATION OR PROCEEDING MAY BE HEARD AND DETERMINED IN SUCH NEW YORK STATE COURT OR, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN SUCH FEDERAL COURT. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO
AGREES THAT A FINAL JUDGMENT IN ANY SUCH ACTION, LITIGATION OR PROCEEDING SHALL BE CONCLUSIVE AND MAY BE ENFORCED IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS BY SUIT ON THE JUDGMENT OR IN ANY OTHER MANNER PROVIDED BY LAW. NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT OR IN ANY OTHER LOAN
DOCUMENT SHALL AFFECT ANY RIGHT THAT THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, ANY LENDER OR THE L/C ISSUER MAY OTHERWISE HAVE TO BRING ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT AGAINST THE BORROWER OR ITS PROPERTIES IN THE
COURTS OF ANY JURISDICTION.  (c)    WAIVER OF VENUE. THE BORROWER IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY OBJECTION THAT IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT IN ANY COURT REFERRED TO IN SUBSECTION
(B) OF THIS SECTION 10.14. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE DEFENSE OF AN INCONVENIENT FORUM TO THE MAINTENANCE OF SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN ANY SUCH
COURT.  (d)    SERVICE OF PROCESS. EACH PARTY HERETO IRREVOCABLY CONSENTS TO SERVICE OF PROCESS IN THE MANNER PROVIDED
FOR NOTICES IN SECTION 10.02. NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT WILL AFFECT THE RIGHT OF ANY PARTY HERETO TO SERVE PROCESS IN ANY OTHER MANNER PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. 
Section 10.15    Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY
(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PERSON HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PERSON WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS
IN THIS SECTION 10.15. 
  97 




Section 10.16    No Advisory or Fiduciary
Responsibility. In connection with all aspects of each transaction contemplated hereby (including in connection with any amendment, waiver or other modification hereof or of any other Loan Document), the Borrower acknowledges and agrees, and
acknowledges its Affiliates understanding, that: (a)(i) the arranging and other services regarding this Agreement provided by the Administrative Agent, the Arranger, and the Lenders are arms-length
commercial transactions between the Borrower and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent, the Arranger and the Lenders on the other hand, (ii) the Borrower has consulted its own legal, accounting, regulatory and tax
advisors to the extent it has deemed appropriate, and (iii) the Borrower is capable of evaluating, and understands and accepts, the terms, risks and conditions of the transactions contemplated hereby and by the other Loan Documents; (b)(i) the
Administrative Agent, the Arranger and each Lender is and has been acting solely as a principal and, except as expressly agreed in writing by the relevant parties, has not been, is not and will not be acting as an advisor, agent or fiduciary for the
Borrower or any of Affiliates or any other Person and (ii) neither the Administrative Agent, the Arranger nor any Lender has any obligation to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby except
those obligations expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents; and (c) the Administrative Agent, the Arranger and the Lenders and their respective Affiliates may be engaged in a broad range of transactions that involve interests
that differ from those of the Borrower and its Affiliates, and neither the Administrative Agent, the Arranger nor any Lender has any obligation to disclose any of such interests to the Borrower or its Affiliates. To the fullest extent permitted by
law, the Borrower hereby waives and releases any claims that it may have against the Administrative Agent, the Arranger or any Lender with respect to any breach or alleged breach of agency or fiduciary duty in connection with any aspect of any
transaction contemplated hereby.  Section 10.17    USA PATRIOT Act Notice. Each Lender that is
subject to the USA PATRIOT Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)) (the PATRIOT Act), and the Administrative Agent (for itself and not on behalf of any
Lender) hereby notifies the Borrower that pursuant to the requirements of the PATRIOT Act, it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Borrower, which information includes the name and address of the Borrower and
other information that will allow such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, to identify the Borrower in accordance with the PATRIOT Act. The Borrower shall, promptly following a request by the Administrative Agent or any Lender,
provide all documentation and other information that the Administrative Agent or such Lender requests in order to comply with its ongoing obligations under applicable know your customer and anti-money laundering rules and regulations,
including the PATRIOT Act.  Section 10.18    Judgment Currency. If, for the purposes of
obtaining judgment in any court, it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder or any other Loan Document in one currency into another currency, the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the
Administrative Agent could purchase the first currency with such other currency on the Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is given. The obligation of the Borrower in respect of any such sum due from it to the Administrative Agent or
the Lenders hereunder or under the other Loan Documents shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency (the Judgment Currency) other than that in which such sum is denominated in accordance with the applicable provisions of
this Agreement (the Agreement Currency), be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, of any sum adjudged to be so due in the
Judgment Currency, the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase the Agreement Currency with the Judgment Currency. If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is less
than the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent or any 
  98 





Lender from the Borrower in the Agreement Currency, the Borrower agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as
the case may be, against such loss. If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is greater than the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent or any Lender in such currency, the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be,
agrees to return the amount of any excess to the Borrower (or to any other Person who may be entitled thereto under applicable law). 
Section 10.19    Electronic Execution; Electronic Records. The words delivery,
execute, execution, signed, signature, and words of like import in any Loan Document or any other document executed in connection herewith shall be deemed to include electronic signatures, the
electronic matching of assignment terms and contract formations on electronic platforms approved by the Administrative Agent, or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability
as a manually executed signature, physical delivery thereof or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent and as provided for in any applicable Law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and
National Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act, or any other similar state laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act; provided, that, notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, the Administrative Agent is under no obligation to agree to accept electronic signatures in any form or in any format unless expressly agreed to by the Administrative Agent pursuant to procedures approved by it; provided,
further, that, without limiting the foregoing, upon the request of the Administrative Agent, any electronic signature shall be promptly followed by such manually executed counterpart. 
The Borrower hereby acknowledges the receipt of a copy of this Agreement and all other Loan Documents. The Administrative Agent and each Lender may, on
behalf of the Borrower, create a microfilm or optical disk or other electronic image of this Agreement and any or all of the other Loan Documents. The Administrative Agent and each Lender may store the electronic image of this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents in its electronic form and then destroy the paper original as part of the Administrative Agents and each Lenders normal business practices, with the electronic image deemed to be an original and of the same legal
effect, validity and enforceability as the paper originals.  Section 10.20    Acknowledgement and
Consent to Bail-In of EEA Financial Institutions . Solely to the extent any Lender or the L/C Issuer that is an EEA Financial Institution is a party to this Agreement and notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in any Loan Document or in any other agreement, arrangement or understanding among any such parties, each party hereto acknowledges that any liability of any Lender or the L/C Issuer that is an EEA Financial Institution arising under any
Loan Document, to the extent such liability is unsecured, may be subject to the Write-Down and Conversion Powers of an EEA Resolution Authority and agrees and consents to, and acknowledges and agrees to be bound by: (a) the application of any
Write-Down and Conversion Powers by an EEA Resolution Authority to any such liabilities arising hereunder which may be payable to it by any Lender or the L/C Issuer that is an EEA Financial Institution; and (b) the effects of any Bail-In Action on any such liability, including, if applicable, (i) a reduction in full or in part or cancellation of any such liability, (ii) a conversion of all, or a portion of, such liability into
shares or other instruments of ownership in such EEA Financial Institution, its parent undertaking, or a bridge institution that may be issued to it or otherwise conferred on it, and that such shares or other instruments of ownership will be
accepted by it in lieu of any rights with respect to any such liability under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or (iii) the variation of the terms of such liability in connection with the exercise of the Write-Down and Conversion
Powers of any EEA Resolution Authority.  Section 10.21    Acknowledgement Regarding any Supported
QFCs. To the extent that the Loan Documents provide support, through a guarantee or otherwise, for any Swap Contract or any other agreement or instrument

ll be effective to the same extent as
the transfer would be effective under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support (and any such interest, obligation and rights in property) were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the
United States. In the event a Covered Party or a BHC Act Affiliate of a Covered Party becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, Default Rights under the Loan Documents that might otherwise apply to such Supported QFC or
any QFC Credit Support that may be exercised against such Covered Party are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such Default Rights could be exercised under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and the Loan
Documents were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. Without limitation of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that rights and remedies of the parties with respect to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event
affect the rights of any Covered Party with respect to a Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support.  [Signature Pages Follow]
