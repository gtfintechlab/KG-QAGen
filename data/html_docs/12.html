</table> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For purposes of the foregoing, <b>Index Debt</b> means senior, unsecured, long-term Indebtedness for Borrowed
Money of the Borrower that is not guaranteed by any other person or subject to any other credit enhancement. If (i) either Moodys or S&amp;P shall not have in effect a rating for the Index Debt (other than by reason of the circumstances
referred to in the last sentence of this paragraph), then such rating agency shall be deemed to have established a rating in Rating Category 5; (ii) the ratings established or deemed to have been established by Moodys and S&amp;P for the Index
Debt shall fall within different Rating Categories, the Applicable Margin shall be based on the higher of the two ratings, and (iii) the ratings established or deemed to have been established by Moodys and S&amp;P for the Index Debt shall
be changed (other than as a result of a change in the rating system of Moodys or S&amp;P), such change shall be effective as of the date on which it is first announced by the applicable rating agency. Each change in the Applicable Margin shall
apply during the period commencing on the effective date of such change and ending on the date immediately preceding the effective date of the next such change. If the rating system of Moodys or S&amp;P shall change, or if either such rating
agency shall cease to be in the business of rating corporate debt obligations, the Borrower and the Lenders shall negotiate in good faith to amend this definition to reflect such changed rating system or the unavailability of ratings from such
rating agency and, pending the effectiveness of any such amendment, the Applicable Margin shall be determined by reference to the rating most recently in effect prior to such change or cessation. </p>
