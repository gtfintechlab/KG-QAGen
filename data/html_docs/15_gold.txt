that such written notice from Borrower shall conspicuously state, in large bold type, that PURSUANT TO SECTION 5.2.10 OF THE LOAN AGREEMENT, A RESPONSE IS REQUIRED WITHIN TWENTY (20) DAYS OF LENDERS RECEIPT OF THIS WRITTEN
NOTICE. If Lender fails to disapprove any proposed Transfer within such period, Borrower shall provide a second written notice requesting approval, which written notice shall conspicuously state, in large bold type, that PURSUANT
TO SECTION 5.2.10 OF THE LOAN AGREEMENT, THE MATTER DESCRIBED HEREIN SHALL BE DEEMED APPROVED IF LENDER DOES NOT RESPOND TO THE CONTRARY WITHIN TEN (10) DAYS OF LENDERS RECEIPT OF THIS WRITTEN NOTICE. Thereafter, if Lender

pledge or transfer all or any part of the Property, shall be permitted during th

nders prior written consent (to extent such consent is required) or otherwise violates any of the restrictions on Transfer under Section 5.2.10 herein; 
(v) if any representation or warranty made by Borrower herein or in any other Loan Document (including, without limitation, any
representation or covenant contained in Section 4.1.30 hereof), or in any report, certificate, financial statement or other instrument, agreement or document furnished to Lender by or on behalf of Borrower shall have been false or
misleading in any material respect as of the date the representation or warranty was made, provided that, with respect to this clause (v), if such breach (1) was inadvertent or unintentional and is susceptible of cure, (2) should not
increase the risk of 
  98 



substantive consolidation of the assets and liabilities of Borrower with those of any other Person as evidenced by a bankruptcy opinion reasonably acceptable to Lender, and (3) if the
representation relates to Borrowers, Guarantors or Major Tenants financial condition at the Closing Date, does not materially impair Borrowers or Guarantors ability to perform its obligations hereunder or under the
other Loan Documents, then such breach shall not constitute an Event of Default if Borrower cures such breach within five (5) Business Days after Lenders written notice to Borrower of such breach; 
(vi) if Borrower or any Principal shall make an assignment for the benefit of creditors; 
(vii) if (A) Borrower, any Principal, Guarantor or any other guarantor or indemnitor under any guarantee issued in
connection with the Loan shall commence any case, proceeding or other action (I) under any existing or future law of any jurisdiction, domestic or foreign, relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, conservatorship or relief of
debtors, seeking to have an order for relief entered with respect to it, or seeking to adjudicate it a bankrupt or insolvent, or seeking reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, winding-up, liquidation, dissolution, composition or other relief with
respect to it or its debts, or (II) seeking appointment of a receiver, trustee, custodian, conservator or other similar official for it or for all or any substantial part of its assets, or the Borrower, any Principal, Guarantor or any other
guarantor or indemnitor shall make a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors; or (B) there shall be commenced against Borrower, any Principal, Guarantor or any other guarantor or indemnitor any case, proceeding or other action of a
nature referred to in clause (A) above that is not dismissed within ninety (90) days of filing (provided, further, however, that with respect to Guarantor or any other guarantor or indemnitor, it shall be at
Lenders option to determine whether any of the foregoing shall be an Event of Default); or (C) there shall be commenced against the Borrower, any Principal, Guarantor or any other guarantor or indemnitor any case, proceeding or other
action seeking issuance of a warrant of attachment, execution, distraint or similar process against all or any substantial part of its assets; or (D) the Borrower, any Principal, Guarantor or any other guarantor or indemnitor shall take any
action in furtherance of, or indicating its consent to, approval of, any of the acts set forth in clause (A), (B), or (C) above; 
(viii) if Borrower attempts to assign its rights under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or any interest herein
or therein in contravention of the Loan Documents;  (ix) if Borrower breaches any negative covenant contained in
Section 5.2 hereof;  (x) with respect to any term, covenant or provision set forth herein which specifically
contains a notice requirement or grace period, if Borrower shall be in default under such term, covenant or condition after the giving of such notice or the expiration of such grace period; 
  99 


(xi) if any of the material terms of any Major Lease are amended or modified
without Lenders prior written consent;  (xii) if there shall be a default by Borrower under the terms of any Major
Lease beyond any applicable notice and cure periods which default could per

lable to it pursuant to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents or at law or in equity, Lender may take such action,
without notice or demand, that Lender deems advisable to protect and enforce its rights against Borrower and in and to the Property, including declaring the Debt to be immediately due and payable, and Lender may enforce or avail itself of any or all
rights or remedies provided in the Loan Documents against Borrower and any or all of the Property, including all rights or remedies available at law or in equity; and upon any Event of Default described in clauses (vi), (vii) or
(viii) above, the Debt and Other Obligations of Borrower hereunder and under the other Loan Documents shall immediately and automatically become due and payable, without notice or demand, and Borrower hereby expressly waives any such notice or
demand, anything contained herein or in any other Loan Document to the contrary notwithstanding.  (c) With respect to any Event of Default
that pertains to Guarantor (the Defaulting Party) such as a Bankruptcy Action with respect to Guarantor, Borrower may cure the same by replacing the Defaulting Party with a Qualified Replacement Guarantor within thirty
(30) days thereafter in accordance with the provisions herein which, but for such Event of Default, would permit the replacement(s). It shall be a condition to such replacement, that Borrower delivers, or causes to be delivered, a
re-affirmation by the Qualified Replacement Guarantor of the obligations under the Guaranty and the Environmental Indemnity, and any other agreement to which Defaulting Party is a party. 
Section 8.2 Remedies. (a) Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, all or any one or more of the rights, powers,
privileges and other remedies available to Lender against Borrower under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents executed and delivered by, or applicable to, Borrower or at law or in equity may be exercised by Lender at any time and from
time to time, whether or not all or any of the Debt shall be declared due and payable, and whether or not Lender shall have commenced any foreclosure proceeding or other action for the enforcement of its rights and remedies under any of the Loan
Documents with respect to all or any part of the Property. Any such actions taken by Lender shall be cumulative and concurrent and may be pursued independently, singularly, successively, together or otherwise, at such time and in such order as
Lender may 

interest, Lender may foreclose the
Security Instrument to recover such delinquent payments or (ii) in the event Lender elects to accelerate less than the entire Outstanding Principal Balance, Lender may foreclose the Security Instrument to recover so much of the principal
balance of the Loan as Lender may accelerate and such other sums secured by the Security Instrument as Lender may elect. Notwithstanding one or more partial foreclosures, the Property shall remain subject to the Security Instrument to secure payment
of sums secured by the Security Instrument and not previously recovered.  (c) Lender shall have the right from time to time to sever the
Note and the other Loan Documents into one or more separate notes, mortgages and other security documents (the Severed Loan Documents) in such denominations as Lender shall determine in its discretion for purposes of evidencing
and enforcing its rights and remedies provided hereunder, provided the same do not (i) increase Borrowers or Guarantors obligations, (ii) diminish their respective rights, or (iii) otherwise adversely affect Borrower,
Guarantor or any Affiliate of Borrower, except (in each case) to a de minimis extent. Borrower shall execute and deliver to Lender from time to time, promptly after the request of Lender, a severance agreement and such other documents as Lender
shall request in order to effect the severance described in the preceding sentence, all in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Lender provided the same do not (i) increase Borrowers or Guarantors obligations,
(ii) diminish their respective rights, or (iii) otherwise adversely affect Borrower, Guarantor or any Affiliate of Borrower, except (in each case) to a de minimis extent. Borrower hereby absolutely and irrevocably appoints Lender as its
true and lawful attorney, coupled with an interest, in its name and stead to make and execute all documents necessary or desirable to effect the aforesaid severance, Borrower ratifying all that its said attorney shall do by virtue thereof; provided,
however, Lender shall not make or execute any such documents under such power until three (3) Business Days after notice has been given to Borrower by Lender of Lenders intent to exercise its rights under such power. If Lender elects to
sever the Note and other Loan Documents during an Event of Default, Borrower shall be obligated to pay any costs or expenses incurred in connection with the preparation, execution, recording or filing of the Severed Loan Documents and the Severed
Loan Documents shall not contain any representations, warranties or covenants not contained in the Loan Documents and any 

cured by or evidencing ownership
interests in all or any portion of the Loan and the Loan Documents or a pool of assets that include the Loan and the Loan Documents (such sales, participations or securitizations, collectively, a Securitization). 
(b) At the request of Lender, and to the extent not already required to be provided by or on behalf of Borrower under this Agreement, Borrower
shall at no additional cost or expense to Borrower (other than deminimis costs and expenses and costs of Borrowers counsel), use reasonable efforts to provide information not in the possession of Lender or which may be reasonably required by
Lender or take other actions reasonably required by Lender, in each case in order to satisfy the market standards to which Lender customarily adheres or which may be reasonably required by prospective investors and/or the Rating Agencies in
connection with any such Securitization, other than an amendment to the Loan Document that would (i) increase Borrowers or Guarantors obligations, (ii) diminish their respective rights, or (iii) otherwise adversely affect
Borrower, Guarantor or any Affiliate of Borrower, except (in each case) to a deminimis extent. Lender shall have the right to provide to prospective investors and the Rating Agencies any information in its possession, including financial statements
relating to Borrower, Guarantor, any mezzanine borrower, the Property and any Tenant of the Improvements. Borrower acknowledges that certain information regarding the Loan and the parties thereto and the Property may be included in a private
placement memorandum, prospectus or other disclosure documents. Borrower agrees that each of Borrower, Principal, Guarantor and their respective officers and representatives, shall, at Lenders request, at Lenders cost and expense (other
than for fees and expenses incurred by Borrowers, Principals or Guarantors outside counsel, which shall be borne by Borrower, Principal or Guarantor, respectively), cooperate with Lenders efforts to arrange for a
Securitization in accordance with the market standards to which 
  103 



Lender customarily adheres and/or which may be required by prospective investors and/or the Rating Agencies in connection with any such Securitization. Borrower, Principal and Guarantor agree to
review, at Lenders request in connection with the Securitization, the Disclosure Documents as such Disclosure Documents relate to Borrower, Principal, Guarantor, any mezzanine borrower, the Property and the Loan, including, the sections
entitled Risk Factors, Special Considerations, Description of the Security Instrument, Description of the Mortgage Loan and Mortgaged Property, The Manager, The Borrower, and
Certain Legal Aspects of the Mortgage Loan, and shall confirm that the factual statements and representations contained in such sections and such other information in the Disclosure Documents (to the extent such information relates to,
or is based on, or includes any information regarding the Property, Borrower, Guarantor, any mezzanine borrower, Manager and/or the Loan) do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to
make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. For sake of clarity, none of Borrower, Guarantor or any of their respective Affiliates, shall be required to review, confirm the accuracy of,
comment and/or approve (a) any general risk factors or disclosures which are not specific to the Property, Borrower, Principal or Guarantor, (b) any summary of the economic Loan terms, (c) any matters pertaining to the securities
issued in connection with the Securitization or other disposition of the Loan (or any part thereof) or (d) any third party materials such as environmental or engineering reports, or summaries thereof or (e) any lease, easement or contract
or other due diligence summaries not prepared by Borrower, an Affiliate of Borrower or their respective counsel, which are applicable to tenants or occupants of the Property, or (f) any information which is publicly available. 
(c) Borrower agrees to make upon Lenders reasonable written request, without limitation, all structural or other changes to the Loan
(including delivery of one or more new component notes to replace the original note or modify the original note to reflect multiple components of the Loan and such new notes or modified note may have different interest rates and amortization
schedules), modifications to any documents evidencing or securing 

 require; provided, however, that in creating such new notes or modified notes or mezzanine notes Borrower
shall not be required to modify (i) the overall weighted average interest rate of the Note at the time of the creation of such new notes or modified notes or mezzanine notes or at any time thereafter (i.e. the weighted average interest rate
payable under such new notes or modified notes or mezzanine notes shall at all times equal the Applicable Interest Rate), provided, however, that such weighted average interest rate may change as a result of the non-pro-rata application of casualty
or condemnation proceeds or principal following an Event of Default, (ii) the stated maturity of the Note, (iii) the aggregate amortization of principal of the Note, (iv) any other material economic term of the Loan, or
(v) decrease the time periods during which Borrower is permitted to perform its obligations under the Loan Documents or, (vi) any other term that would not (i) increase Borrowers or Guarantors obligations,
(ii) diminish their respective rights, or (iii) otherwise adversely affect Borrower, Guarantor or any Affiliate of Borrower, except (in each case) to a de minimis extent. In connection with the foregoing, Borrower covenants and agrees to
modify the Cash Management Agreement to reflect the newly created components and/or mezzanine loans.
