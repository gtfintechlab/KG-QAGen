SECTION 2.03     Borrowing Procedure.  In order to request a Loan, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such request by submitting a Borrowing Request not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, three Business Days before a proposed Loan.  Each such Borrowing Request shall be irrevocable and shall specify the following information:  (i) the date of such Loan (which shall be a Business Day); (ii) the number and location of the account to which funds are to be disbursed; and (iii) the amount of such Loan; provided,  however, that, notwithstanding any contrary specification in any Borrowing Request, each requested Loan shall comply with the requirements set forth in Section 2.02.  The Administrative Agent shall promptly advise the applicable Lenders of any notice given pursuant to this Section 2.03 (and the contents thereof), and of each Lender’s portion of the requested Loan.


SECTION 2.04      Evidence of Debt; Repayment of Loans.  (a)  The Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Loan of such Lender on the Maturity Date,






 

54




			 

		



together with accrued and unpaid interest of such amount to but excluding the date of payment thereof.


(b)        Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time under this Agreement.


(c)        The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it will record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder from the Borrower or any Subsidiary Guarantor and each Lender’s share thereof.


(d)        The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraphs (b) and (c) of this Section 2.04 shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations therein recorded absent manifest error; provided, in the event of any conflict between the entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraphs (b) and (c) of this Section 2.04, the accounts maintained by the Administrative Agent pursuant to paragraph (c) shall control in the absence of manifest error; provided,  however, that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligations of the Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with their terms.


(e)        Any Lender may request that Loans made by it hereunder be evidenced by a promissory note.  In such event, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to such Lender and its registered assigns and in substantially the form of Exhibit D.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in the event any Lender shall request and receive such a promissory note, the interests represented by such note shall at all times (including after any assignment of all or part of such interests pursuant to Section 9.03) be represented by one or more promissory notes payable to the payee named therein or its registered assigns.


SECTION 2.05      Fees.  (a)  The Borrower agrees to pay to each Lender that is not a Defaulting Lender, through the Administrative Agent, on the last Business Day of March, June, September and December in each year and on each date on which any Commitment of such Lender shall expire or be terminated as provided herein, a commitment fee (a “Commitment Fee”) equal to 1.50% per annum on the average daily unused amount of the Commitment of such Lender during the preceding quarter (or other period commencing with the date hereof or ending with the Maturity Date or the date on which the Commitments of such Lender shall otherwise expire or be terminated, as applicable).  All Commitment Fees shall be computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in a year of 360 days.


(b)        The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own account the Administrative Agent Fee in the amounts and as provided in the Administrative Agent Fee Letter.  Such annual Administrative Agent Fee will be in addition to reimbursement of the Administrative Agent’s reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses required in its






 

55




			 

		



capacity as Administrative Agent.  Once paid, the Administrative Agent Fee or any part thereof payable under this Agreement shall not be refundable under any circumstances.


(c)        The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own account the Closing Fee on the Closing Date in the amount and as provided in the Administrative Agent Fee Letter.


(d)        All Fees shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent for distribution, if and as appropriate, among the Lenders.  Once paid, none of the Fees shall be refundable under any circumstances.


SECTION 2.06     Interest on Loans.  (a)  Subject to the provisions of Section 2.07, the Loans shall bear interest (computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days and calculated from and including the date of such Loan to but excluding the date of repayment thereof) at a rate per annum equal to the Adjusted LIBO Rate plus the Applicable Percentage.


(b)        Interest on each Loan shall be payable on the Interest Payment Dates except as otherwise provided in this Agreement.  The applicable date of the Interest Payment Date shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.


SECTION 2.07      Default Interest.  If (a) the Borrower shall default in the payment of any principal of or interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount due hereunder or under any other Loan Document, by acceleration or otherwise or (b) if any Event of Default under Article VII has occurred and is continuing then, in the case of clause (a) of this Section 2.07, until such defaulted amount shall have been paid in full or, in the case of clause (b) of this Section 2.07, from the date of occurrence of such Event of Default and for so long as such Event of Default is continuing, to the extent permitted by law, all amounts outstanding under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall bear interest (after as well as before judgment), payable on demand, at a rate (computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days) equal to the rate that would be applicable to the Loans plus 3.0

announced that, after the end of 2021, it would no longer persuade or compel contributing banks to make rate submissions to the ICE Benchmark Administration (together with any successor to the ICE Benchmark Administrator, the “IBA”) for purposes of the IBA setting the London interbank offered rate.  As a result, it is possible that commencing in 2022, the London interbank offered rate may no longer be available or may no longer be deemed an appropriate reference rate upon which to determine the interest rate on the Loans.  In light of this eventuality, public and private sector industry initiatives are currently underway to identify new or alternative reference rates to be used in place of the London






 

56




			 

		



interbank offered rate.  In the event that the London interbank offered rate is no longer available or in certain other circumstances as set forth in this Section 2.08, this Section 2.08 provides a mechanism for determining an alternative rate of interest.  The Administrative Agent will notify the Borrower, pursuant to this Section 2.08, in advance of any change to the reference rate upon which the interest rate on the Loans is based.  However, the Administrative Agent does not warrant or accept any responsibility for, and shall not have any liability with respect to, the administration, submission or any other matter related to the London interbank offered rate or other rates in the definition of “LIBO Rate” or with respect to any alternative or successor rate thereto, or replacement rate therefor or thereof, including, without limitation, whether the composition or characteristics of any such alternative, successor or replacement reference rate, as it may or may not be adjusted pursuant to this Section 2.08, will be similar to, or produce the same value or economic equivalence of, the LIBO Rate or have the same volume or liquidity as did the London interbank offered rate prior to its discontinuance or unavailability.


(b)        Benchmark Replacement.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, (i) upon the determination of the Administrative Agent (which shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that a Benchmark Transition Event has occurred or (ii) upon the occurrence of an Early Opt-in Election, as applicable, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower may amend this Agreement to replace the LIBO Rate with a Benchmark Replacement, by a written document executed by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, subject to the requirements of this Section 2.08.  Notwithstanding the requirements of Section 9.07(b) or anything else to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any such amendment with respect to a Benchmark Transition Event will become effective and binding upon the Administrative Agent, the Borrower and the Lenders at 5:00 p.m. on the fifth (5th) Business Day after the Administrative Agent has posted such proposed amendment to all Lenders and the Borrower so long as the Administrative Agent has not received, by such time, written notice of objection to such amendment from Lenders comprising the Majority Lenders, and any such amendment with respect to an Early Opt-in Election will become effective and binding upon the Administrative Agent, the Borrower and the Lenders on the date that Lenders comprising the Majority Lenders have delivered to the Administrative Agent written notice that such Majority Lenders accept such amendment.  No replacement of the LIBO Rate with a Benchmark Replacement pursuant to this Section 2.08 will occur prior to the applicable Benchmark Transition Start Date.


(c)        Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes.  In connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement, the Administrative Agent will have the right to make Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement.


(d)        Notices; Standards for Decisions and Determinations.  The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders in writing of (i) any occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event or an Early Opt-in Election, as applicable, and its related Benchmark Replacement Date and Benchmark Transition Start Date, (ii) the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement, (iii) the effectiveness of any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes and (iv) the commencement or conclusion of any Benchmark






 

57




			 

		



Unavailability Period.  Any determination, decision or election that may be made by the Administrative Agent or Lenders pursuant to this Section 2.08 including, without limitation, any determination with respect to a tenor, comparable replacement rate or adjustment, or implementation of any Benchmark Replacement Rate Conforming Changes, or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action, will be conclusive and binding on all parties hereto absent manifest error and may be made in its or their sole discretion and without consent from any other party hereto, except, in each case, as expressly required pursuant to this Section 2.08 and shall not be a basis of any claim of liability of any kind or nature by any party hereto, all such claims being hereby waived individually be each party hereto.


(e)        Benchmark Unavailability Period.  During the continuation of a Benchmark Unavailability Period the Loans shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Percentage.


SECTION 2.09   Termination and Reduction of Commitments.  (a)  The Commitments shall automatically terminate on the Maturity Date.


(b)        Upon at least three Business Days’ prior irrevocable written notice to the Administrative Agent before 12:00 Noon New York City time, the Borrower may at any time in whole permanently terminate, or from time to time in part permanently reduce, the Commitments; provided,  however, that (i) each partial reduction of the Commitments shall be in an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and in a minimum amount of $5,000,000 and (ii) the Total Commitment shall not be reduced to an amount that is less than the Aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure at the time.  A notice of termination or reduction may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, indentures or similar agreements or other transactions, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by written notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied.


(c)        Each reduction in the Commitments hereunder shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments.  The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Lenders, on the date of each termination or reduction, the Commitment Fees on the amount of the Commitments so terminated or reduced accrued to but excluding the date of such termination or reduction.


(d)        On the date of each partial or total reduction of the Commitments the Borrower shall pay the applicable Yield Maintenance Amount on such terminated Commitment to the Administrative Agent; provided that, no Yield Maintenance Amount shall be due in the event the Borrower elects a total reduction of the Commitments permitted under Section 2.12.






 

58




			 

		



SECTION 2.10      Optional Prepayment.  (a)  The Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay the Loans, in whole or in part, upon at least one Business Days’ prior written notice to the Administrative Agent before 12:00 noon, New York City time; provided, however, that each partial prepayment shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $5,000,000.


(b)        Each notice of prepayment shall specify the prepayment date and the principal amount of each Loan (or portion thereof) to be prepaid, shall be irrevocable unless conditioned upon a refinancing, and shall commit the Borrower to prepay such Loan by the amount stated therein on the date stated therein.  Subject to Section 2.10(c), all prepayments under this Section 2.10 shall be without premium or penalty.  All prepayments under this Section 2.10 shall be accompanied by accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount to be prepaid to but excluding the date of payment and any applicable Yield Maintenance Amount.


(c)        All prepayments made after the Effective Availability Period shall result in the permanent reduction of the Commitments in an amount equal to the principal being repaid an

ommitments by an amount equal to such Net Proceeds.


(d)        If the Vessel Fleet Value is less than $500.0 million at the time of the receipt of Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale, the Borrower shall prepay the Loans outstanding together with accrued and unpaid interest and any Yield Maintenance Amount thereon within






 

59




			 

		



two (2) Business Days after receipt of such Net Proceeds and permanently reduce the Commitments by an amount equal to such Net Proceeds.


(e)        If the the Vessel Fleet Value is less than $500.0 million at the time of receipt of Net Proceeds from insurance proceeds, the Borrower shall prepay the Loans outstanding together with accrued and unpaid interest and any Yield Maintenance Amount thereon within two (2) Business Days after receipt of such Net Proceeds from such insurance proceeds and permanently reduce the Commitments by an amount equal to such Net Proceeds from such insurance proceeds.


(f)        The Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent, at the time of each repayment or prepayment required under this Section 2.11, (i) a certificate signed by a Financial Officer of the Borrower setting forth in reasonable detail the calculation of the amount of such repayment or prepayment and (ii) in the case of any repayment or prepayment prior to the Maturity Date, by or before 2:00 PM New York City time at least three days prior irrevocable written notice of such repayment or prepayment.  Each notice of repayment or prepayment shall specify the repayment or prepayment date, the principal amount of the Loans to be repaid or prepaid. Repayments or prepayments of Loans under this Section 2.11 shall be subject to any applicable Yield Maintenance Amount, but shall otherwise be without premium or penalty, and shall be accompanied by accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount to be repaid or prepaid to but excluding the date of payment and any applicable Yield Maintenance Amount.


SECTION 2.12      Increased Costs.


(a)        Increased Costs Generally.  If any Change in Law shall:


(i)         impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets or liabilities of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended to or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate);


(ii)        subject any Lender to any Taxes of any kind whatsoever with respect to the Loan made by it, or change the basis of taxation of payments to such Lender in respect thereof (except for Indemnified Taxes and the imposition of, or any change in the rate of, any Excluded Tax payable by such Lender); or


(iii)      impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense (other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or Loans made by such Lender;


and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making any Loan or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender, (A) the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered (except for Indemnified Taxes and the imposition of, or any change in the rate of, any Excluded Tax payable by such Lender) or (B) the Borrower may elect to terminate all of the Commitments pursuant to Section 2.09 by providing prior irrevocable written notice to



 

60




			 

		



the Administrative Agent within three Business Days of receipt of notice thereof, in which case the Borrower shall not be liable for such additional amount or amounts.


(b)        Capital Requirements.  If any Lender shall have determined that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or any lending office of such Lender or such Lender’s holding company, if any, regarding capital adequacy or liquidity requirements, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s capital or on the capital of such Lender’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitment of such Lender or the Loans made by such Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender’s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s policies and the policies of such Lender’s holding company with respect to capital adequacy or liquidity), then from time to time the Borrower (i) will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender’s holding company for any such reduction suffered (except for Indemnified Taxes and the imposition of, or any change in the rate of, any Excluded Tax payable by such Lender) or (ii) may elect to terminate all of the Commitments pursuant to Section 2.09 by providing prior irrevocable written notice to the Administrative Agent within three Business Days of receipt of notice thereof, in which case the Borrower shall not be liable for such reduction suffered.


(c)        Certificates for Reimbursement.  A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 2.12 and delivered to the Borrower, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.


(d)        Delay in Requests.  Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section 2.12 shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section 2.12 for any increased costs or expenses incurred or reductions suffered more than six months prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or expenses or reductions, and of such Lender’s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or expenses or reductions is retroactive, then the six-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).


SECTION 2.13     Pro Rata Treatment.  Each Loan, each payment or prepayment of principal of any Loan, each payment of interest on the Loans, each payment of the Commitment Fees, each payment of the Yield Maintenance Amount, and each reduction of the Commitments shall be allocated pro rata among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments (or, if such Commitments shall have expired or been terminated, in accordance with the respective principal amounts of their outstanding Loans).  Each Lender agrees that in computing such Lender’s portion of any Loan to be made hereunder, the Administrative Agent may, in its reasonable discretion, round each Lender’s percentage of such Loan to the next higher or lower whole Dollar amount.


SECTION 2.14      Sharing of Payments by Lenders.  If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any






 

61




			 

		



principal of or interest or Yield Maintenance Amount on any of its Loans or other obligations hereunder resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and accrued interest and Yield Maintenance Amount thereon or other such obligations greater than its pro rata share thereof as provided herein, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and such other obligations of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest and Yield Maintenance Amount on their respective Loans and other amounts owing them; provided that:


(i)         if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and


(ii)        the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender), or (y) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply).


The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation, but only to the extent that such consent does not increase the aggregate liability of the Borrower.


SECTION 2.15     Payments.  The Borrower shall make each payment (including principal of or interest on any Loan or any Fees or any Yield Maintenance Amount or other amounts) hereunder and under any other Loan Document not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date when due in immediately available Dollars, without setoff, defense or counterclaim.  Each such payment shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its Beneficiary Bank:  The Bank of New York Mellon ABA:  021-000-018, Account Name:  Angelo, Gordon Energy Servicer, LLC.  All payments received by the Administrative Agent after 12:00 noon, New York City time, may be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day (in the Administrative Agent’s sole discretion).  The Administrative Agent shall promptly distribute to each Lender any payments actually received by the Administrative Agent on behalf of such Lender.  Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, whenever any payment (including principal of or interest on any Loan, Yield Maintenance Amount or any Fees or other amounts) hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall become due, or otherwise would occur, on a day that is not a Business Day, such payment may be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of interest or Fees, if applicable.






 

62




			 

		



SECTION 2.16      Taxes.  (a)  Payments Free of Taxes.  Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party under this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable law.  If any applicable law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable withholding agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a withholding agent, then the applicable withholding agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made.


(b)        Payments of Other Taxes by the Loan Parties.  The Loan Parties shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes.


(c)        Indemnification by the Loan Parties.  The Loan Parties shall jointly and severally indemnify each Recipient, within 10 days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 2.16) payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.


(d)        Indemnification by the Lenders.  Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand thereof, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Loan Parties to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 9.03(d) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to such Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this paragraph.






 

63




			 

		



(e)        Evidence of Payments.  As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by any Loan Party to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section 2.16, such Loan Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.


(f)        Status of Lenders.


(i)         Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from, or reduction of, withholding Tax with respect to payments made under this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding, such as an IRS Form W-9, W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E (or other such applicable IRS tax form).  In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 2.16(f)(ii)) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.


(ii)        Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if a payment made to a Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document would be subject to U.S. Federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.  Solely for purposes of this Section 2.16(f)(ii), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.


(iii)      Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.






 

64




			 

		



(g)        Treatment of Certain Refunds.  If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section (including by the payment of additional amounts paid pursuant to this Section 2.16), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments, or additional amounts paid, made under this Section with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund).  Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph (plus any penalties, interest or other charge

 that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph, in no event will any indemnified party be required to pay any amount to any indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph the payment of which would place such indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than such indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid.  This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.


(h)        Survival.  Each party’s obligations under this Section 2.16 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document.


(i)         Defined Terms.  For purposes of this Section, the term “applicable law” includes FATCA.


SECTION 2.17      Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.  (a)  Designation of a Different Lending Office.  If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.12, or requires the Borrower to pay additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, then such Lender shall (at the request of the Borrower) use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.12 or 2.16, as the case may be, in the future, and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender.  The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.


(b)        Replacement of Lenders.  If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.12, or if the Borrower is required to pay additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16 and, in each case, such Lender has declined or is unable to designate a different lending office in accordance

with Section 2.17(a), or if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender or a Non-Consenting Lender, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 9.03), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an Eligible Assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that:


(i)         the Borrower shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the assignment fee (if any) specified in Section 9.03;


(ii)        such Lender shall have received payment in immediately available funds of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of Loans, accrued interest thereon, any Yield Maintenance Amount then due to such Lender and accrued fees of such Lender and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts);


(iii)      in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.12 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.16, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter;


(iv)       such assignment does not conflict with applicable law; and


(v)        in the case of any assignment resulting from a Lender becoming a Non-Consenting Lender, the applicable assignee shall have consented to the applicable amendment, waiver or consent.


A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.


SECTION 2.18    Defaulting Lender.  (a)  Defaulting Lender Adjustments.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as such Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable law:


(i)         Waivers and Amendments.  Such Defaulting Lender’s right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in the definition of Required Lenders.

66




			 

		



amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder; second, as the Borrower may request (so long as no Default or Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent; third, if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to be held in a deposit account and released pro rata in order to satisfy such Defaulting Lender’s potential future funding obligations with respect to Loans under this Agreement; fourth, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; fifth, so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and sixth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share, and (y) such Loans were made at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 4.01 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of all Non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of such Defaulting Lender until such time as all Loans are held by the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the Commitments without giving effect to Section 2.18(a)(iv).  Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.


(iii)      Certain Fees.  No Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive any Commitment Fee for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and the Borrower shall not be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender).


(b)        Defaulting Lender Cure.  If the Borrower and the Administrative Agent agree in writing that a Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein, that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans to be held pro rata by the Lenders in accordance with the Commitments (without giving effect to Section 2.18(a)(iv)), whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided,  further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender’s having been a Defaulting Lender.

(d)        No mandatory prepayments of the Loans shall be required during the Availability Period, other than pursuant to Section 2.09 or Section 2.11, even after the Availability Termination Date; provided, if the principal amount of the Loans outstanding on the Availability Termination Date is less than the aggregate Commitments on such date, the Commitments shall be reduced by such difference and such reduction shall be treated as a reduction of Commitments in accordance with Section 2.09.


(e)        The Borrower expressly acknowledges that (i) the Lenders have no obligation to make any Loans or fund any Borrowing Requests on or after the Availability Termination Date, (ii) the Lenders may not extend the Availability Termination Date at all, or may only extend the Availability Termination Date for a shorter period of time than that remaining until the Maturity Date, (iii) the Lenders may reduce the Commitments for any extension of the Availability Termination Date to an amount less than the total Commitments, and (iv) any extension of the Availability Termination Date is subject to the individual credit processes of each Lender, exercised in each Lender’s sole discretion.

The Borrower agrees to provide the Administrative Agent with prior written notice (or such later notice as the Administrative Agent shall agree in its sole discretion) of any change in the jurisdiction of organization or formation of any Loan Party.  The Borrower agrees not to effect or permit any change referred to in the preceding sentence unless all filings have been made within the relevant time frame under the Uniform Commercial Code or otherwise that are required in order for the Collateral Agent to continue at all times following such change to have a valid, legal and perfected security interest in all the Collateral.  The Borrower also agrees promptly to notify the Administrative Agent if any material portion of the Collateral is damaged or destroyed.

SECTION 5.11     Preparation of Environmental Reports.  If a Default caused by reason of a breach of Section 3.17 or Section 5.10 shall have occurred and be continuing for more than 20 days without the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary commencing activities reasonably likely to cure such Default, at the written request of the Required Lenders through the Administrative Agent, provide to the Lenders within 45 days after such request, at the expense of the Loan Parties, an environmental compliance audit or other assessment report regarding the matters which are the subject of such Default, prepared by an environmental consulting firm reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and indicating the presence or absence of Hazardous Materials or other violations of Environmental Laws and the estimated cost of any compliance or remedial action in connection with such Default.


SECTION 5.12    Further Assurances.  Execute any and all further documents, financing statements, agreements and instruments, and take all further action (including filing Uniform Commercial Code and other financing statements, mortgages and deeds of trust) that may be required under applicable law, or that the Required Lenders, the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent may reasonably request, in order to effectuate the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents and in order to grant, preserve, protect and perfect the validity and first priority of the security interests created or intended to be created by the Collateral Documents.  If, after the Closing Date, (i) the Borrower acquires or creates any Restricted Subsidiary (other than an Immaterial Subsidiary), (ii) as of the date of any financial statements delivered pursuant to Section 5.04, a Restricted Subsidiary that was previously an Immaterial Subsidiary has ceased to meet the definition thereof (but remains a Restricted Subsidiary), or (iii) a third party consent is no longer required in order for PIDWAL to provide a Guarantee (but PIDWAL remains a Restricted Subsidiary and is not an Immaterial Subsidiary), or, with respect to PDVIII and PDSI, the Zonda Release Date occurs, then the Borrower will cause PIDWAL or such other Subsidiary, as the case may be, to, within 20 Business Days of such event, become a Loan Party and execute amendments to the Collateral Documents pursuant to which it will grant a Lien on any Collateral held by it in favor of the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders, and become a Collateral Grantor thereunder, and cause such Liens to be perfected as required thereby.  The Borrower will



 

85




			 

		



not be obligated to seek to obtain any third party consent for PIDWAL to provide a guarantee.  The Borrower shall, and shall cause each other Collateral Grantor to, at the Borrower’s sole cost and expense:  (a) at the request of the Administrative Agent, execute and deliver all such agreements and instruments and take all further action as may be reasonably necessary or desirable (i) to describe more fully or accurately the property intended to be Collateral or the obligations intended to be secured by any Collateral Document and/or (ii) to continue and maintain the Collateral Agent’s first-priority perfected security interest in the Collateral (subject to Permitted Collateral Liens); and (b) at the request of the Administrative Agent, file any such notice filings or other agreements or instruments as may be reasonably necessary or desirable under applicable law to perfect the Liens created by the Collateral Documents.  Such security interests and Liens will be created under the Collateral Documents in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, and the Borrower shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the Collateral Agent, within 60 days or such longer period as the Administrative Agent may agree in its sole discretion, all such instruments and documents (including legal opinions, title insurance policies and lien searches) as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably request to evidence compliance with this Section 5.12.  The Borrower agrees to provide such evidence as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably request as to the perfection and priority status of each such security interest and Lien.  In furtherance of the foregoing, the Borrower will give prompt notice to the Administrative Agent of the acquisition by it or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries of an ownership interest in  real property (or any interest in real property) having a Fair Market Value in the aggregate in excess of $25,000,000.


SECTION 5.13      Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries.  (a)  The Board of Directors of the Borrower may designate any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary if:


(i)         the Borrower would be permitted to make (i) a Permitted Investment or (ii) an Investment pursuant to Section 6.01, in either case, in an amount equal to the Fair Market Value of all outstanding Investments owned by the Borrower and the Restricted Subsidiaries in such Subsidiary at the time of such designation;


(ii)        such Restricted Subsidiary meets the definition of an “Unrestricted Subsidiary”;


(iii)      the designation would not constitute or cause (with or without the passage of time) a Default or Event of Default and no Default or Event of Default would be in existence following such designation;


(iv)       at the time of and after giving effect to such designation and Investment the Vessel Fleet Value is greater than $500.0 million; and


(v)        the Borrower delivers to the Administrative Agent a certified copy of a resolution of the Board of Directors of the Borrower giving effect to such designation and an Officers’ Certificate certifying that such designation complied with the preceding conditions.






 

86




			 

		



If a Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the aggregate Fair Market Value of all outstanding Investments owned by the Borrower and the Restricted Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be deemed to be an Investment made as of the time of the designation and will reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments under Section 6.01 or under one or more clauses of the definition of Permitted Investments, as determined by the Borrower.


If, at any time, any Unrestricted Subsidiary designated as such would fail to meet the preceding requirements as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, then such Subsidiary will thereafter cease to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary for purposes of this Agreement and any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary and any Liens on the assets of such Subsidiary will be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date and, if such Indebtedness or Liens are not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under Section 6.03, the Borrower or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary will be in default of such Section.


(b)        The Board of Directors of the Borrower may at any time designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary if:


(i)         the Borrower and the Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur the Indebtedness and Liens (and the Borrower and the Restricted Subsidiaries shall be deemed to Incur such Indebtedness and Liens upon such designation) of such Subsidiary under Sections 6.03 and 6.06;


(ii)        the designation would not constitute or cause (with or without the passage of time) a Default or Event of Default and no Default or Event of Default would be in existence following such designation; and


(iii)      the Borrower delivers to the Administrative Agent a certified copy of a resolution of the Board of Directors of the Borrower giving effect to such designation and an Officers’ Certificate certifying that such designation complied with the preceding conditions.

(ii)        make loans or advances to the Borrower or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries; or


(iii)      sell, lease or transfer any of its properties or assets to the Borrower or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries (all such actions set forth in these clauses (i) through (iii) above being collectively referred to as “Intercompany Transfers”).


(b)        The restrictions in Section 6.02(a) will not apply to encumbrances or restrictions on the ability of any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to make Intercompany Transfers existing under or by reason of:


(i)         agreements governing Indebtedness as in effect on the Closing Date;

93




			 

		



(xiv)     instruments governing Indebtedness that is permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the Closing Date pursuant to Section 6.03;  provided that, at the time such Indebtedness is Incurred, either (a) such encumbrance or restriction is customary for financings of the same type, and such restrictions would not reasonably be expected to materially impair the Borrower’s ability to make scheduled payments of interest and principal on the Indebtedness under the Loan Documents when due or any Guarantor’s ability to make payment under its Guarantee, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Borrower or a Financial Officer of the Borrower, or (b) the restrictions therein are not materially more restrictive, taken as a whole, than those contained in this Agreement, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or a Financial Officer of the Borrower.

95




			 

		



Loan Documents or a guarantee thereof, then the guarantee shall be subordinated or pari passu, as applicable, to the same extent as the Indebtedness guaranteed;


(viii)    the Incurrence by the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness in respect of workers’ compensation claims, self-insurance obligations, and performance, customs, importation and surety bonds or other Indebtedness of a like nature, in each case in the ordinary course of business;

(x)        the Incurrence by the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness arising from agreements providing for indemnification, earn-outs, adjustment of purchase price or similar obligations, or guarantees or letters of credit, surety bonds or performance bonds securing any obligations of the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to such agreements, in each case, Incurred in connection with the acquisition or disposition of any business, assets or the Capital Stock of a Subsidiary, other than guarantees of Indebtedness Incurred by any Person acquiring all or any portion of such business, assets or the Capital Stock of a Subsidiary for the purpose of financing such acquisition; provided, however, that, in the case of a disposition, the maximum aggregate liability in respect of all such Indebtedness shall at no time exceed the gross proceeds (including non-cash proceeds (the Fair Market Value of such non-cash proceeds being measured at the time received and without giving effect to any subsequent changes in value)) actually received by the Borrower and the Restricted Subsidiaries in connection with such disposition;


(xi)       the Incurrence by the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness not otherwise permitted pursuant to clauses (i) through (x) above or clause (xii) or (xiii) below in an amount, together with any other Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (xi) then outstanding, not in excess of $50.0 million; provided that such Indebtedness incurred pursuant to this clause (xi) shall be used to fund (A) capital expenditures, (B) asset acquisitions or (C) costs associated with preparing a stacked Vessel for work under an executed contract for such Vessel;


(xii)      Indebtedness represented by Capital Lease Obligations, mortgage financings or purchase money obligations (or any guarantee thereof or indemnity with respect thereto), in each case, incurred for the purpose of financing all or any part of the purchase price or cost of construction or improvement of property, plant or equipment used in the business of the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary, and Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof, in an amount, including all such Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness, not to exceed $50 million at any time outstanding; and


(xiii)    Acquired Debt; provided that, after giving pro forma effect to the relevant transaction (A) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be






 

96




			 

		



continuing and (B) the Borrower could Incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to clause (ii) above.


For purposes of determining compliance with this Section 6.03, in the event that an item of proposed Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Debt described in clauses (i) through (xiii) above, the Borrower or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary will be permitted to classify such item of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) on the date of its Incurrence, or later reclassify all or a portion of such item of Indebtedness, in any manner that complies with this Section 6.03.  The accrual of interest or Preferred Stock dividends, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest on any Indebtedness in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms (including the payment of “PIK” interest with respect to the Second Lien PIK Notes, the reclassification of Preferred Stock as Indebtedness due to a change in accounting principles, and the payment of dividends on Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock in the form of additional shares of the same class of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness or an issuance of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock for purposes of this covenant; provided, in each such case, that the amount of any such accrual, accretion or payment is included in Consolidated Interest Expense of the Borrower as accrued.


The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date will be:


(i)         the accreted value of the Indebtedness, in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount;


(ii)        the principal amount of the Indebtedness, in the case of any other Indebtedness; and


(iii)       in respect of Indebtedness of another Person secured by a Lien on the assets of the specified Person, the lesser of:


(A)       the Fair Market Value of such assets at the date of determination; and


(B)       the amount of the Indebtedness of the other Person; and


(iv)       in the case of Hedging Obligations, the termination value of the agreement or arrangement giving rise to such Hedging Obligations that would be payable by the specified Person at such date.


(c)        Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Borrower will not, and will not permit any Guarantor to, directly or indirectly, Incur any Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt) that is subordinated or junior in right of payment to any Indebtedness of the Borrower or such Guarantor, as the case may be, unless such Indebtedness is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the First Lien Notes and the Indebtedness under the Loan Documents or such Guarantor’s guarantee thereof to the extent and in the same manner as such Indebtedness is subordinated to other Indebtedness of the Borrower or such Guarantor, as the case may be.






 

97




			 

		



For purposes of determining compliance with any Dollar-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the Dollar Equivalent of the principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another currency will be utilized, calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or first committed, in the case of Indebtedness Incurred under a revolving credit facility; provided that if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than Dollars, and such refinancing would cause the applicable Dollar-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such Dollar-denominated restriction will be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced.


Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 6.03, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Borrower or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in exchange rates or currency values.


Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Borrower shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, Incur any First Lien Debt with payment priority with respect to the First Lien Notes pursuant to the Collateral Agency Agreement or otherwise, other than Indebtedness under this Agreement.


SECTION 6.04      Limitation on Asset Sales.  (a)  The Borrower will not, and will not permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, consummate any Asset Sale unless:


(i)         the Borrower or the Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration at the time of consummation of such Asset Sale at least equal to the Fair Market Value of the assets or Equity Interests issued or sold or otherwise disposed of; and


(ii)        at least 75% of the consideration received in such Asset Sale by the Borrower or such Restricted Subsidiary is in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents;


provided, that the foregoing requirements shall not apply with respect to any Involuntary Transfer.


(b)        For purposes of Section 6.04(a), each of the following will be deemed to be cash:


(i)         any Indebtedness or other liabilities, as shown on the Borrower’s most recent consolidated balance sheet, of the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than contingent liabilities and liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the First Lien Notes, the Indebtedness under the Loan Documents or any guarantee thereof) that are assumed, repaid or retired by the transferee of any such assets so long as the Borrower or such Restricted Subsidiary is released from further liability in respect thereof; and






 

98




			 

		



(ii)        any securities, notes or other obligations received by the Borrower or any such Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are, within 180 days after receipt thereof, converted by the Borrower or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents, to the extent of the cash or Cash Equivalents received in that conversion.


(c)        Subject to Section 2.11(c), within 365 days after the receipt of any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale (including, without limitation, an Involuntary Transfer), the Borrower or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, shall apply such Net Proceeds at its option to any combination of the following:


(i)         to repay Indebtedness under this Agreement and correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto or to repurchase, repay or prepay (or offer to repurchase, repay or prepay) other First Lien Debt in accordance with its terms;


(ii)        to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or any Capital Stock of, any Person primarily engaged in a Permitted Business, if, in the case of any such acquisition of Capital Stock, such Person is or becomes a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such acquisition;


(iii)      to make a capital expenditure that is used or useful in a Permitted Business; or


(iv)       to acquire other assets that are not classified as current assets under GAAP and that are used or useful in a Permitted Business (including, without limitation, Vessels, related assets and any related Ready for Sea Costs) or make any deposit, installment or progress payment in respect of such assets or payment of any related Ready for Sea Costs,


provided that (x) a binding commitment made within the 365-day period described above by the Borrower or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary to apply Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale in accordance with clauses (ii), (iii) and/or (iv) above shall satisfy the requirements of such clauses with respect to such Net Proceeds so long as such Net Proceeds are actually so applied within 545 days from the receipt thereof from such Asset Sale and (y) if all or any portion of the assets sold or transferred in such Asset Sale constituted Collateral, in the case of any application of Net Proceeds pursuant to clause (ii), (iii) or (iv) above, the Borrower shall, or shall cause the applicable Restricted Subsidiary to, pledge any assets (including, without limitation, any acquired Capital Stock) acquired with such Net Proceeds to secure the First Lien Obligations on a first-priority secured basis (subject to the payment priority in favor of the Lenders hereunder and subject to Permitted Collateral Liens) pursuant to the Collateral Documents in accordance with this Agreement.


(d)        Pending the final application of any Net Proceeds, the Borrower or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary may apply the Net Proceeds to temporarily reduce outstanding revolving credit Indebtedness of the Borrower or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries, respectively, or invest the Net Proceeds in cash and Cash Equivalents.

SECTION 6.05      Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates.  (a)  The Borrower will not, and will not permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any payment to, or sell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its properties or assets to, or purchase any property or assets from, or enter into or make or amend any transaction, contract, agreement, understanding, loan, advance or guarantee with, or for the benefit of, any Affiliate of the Borrower (each, an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving, with respect to any such transaction or series of related transactions, payments or consideration in excess of $1 million, unless:


(i)         the Affiliate Transaction is on terms that are either (a) no less favorable to the Borrower or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that could have been obtained in a comparable arm’s-length transaction by the Borrower or such Restricted Subsidiary with a Person that is not an Affiliate of the Borrower or (b) if, in the good faith judgment of the Borrower’s Board of Directors, no comparable transaction is available with which to compare such Affiliate Transaction, such Affiliate Transaction is otherwise fair to the Borrower or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view; and


(ii)        the Borrower delivers to the Administrative Agent:


(A)       with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions involving aggregate consideration in excess of $25 million, a resolution of the Board of Directors of the Borrower accompanied by an Officers’ Certificate certifying that such Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions complies with this Section 6.05 and that such Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions has been approved by a majority of the disinterested members of the Board of Directors of the Borrower; and


(B)       with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions involving aggregate consideration in excess of $50 million, an opinion issued to the Board of Directors of the Borrower by an accounting, appraisal or investment banking firm of international standing or generally recognized in the shipping or offshore drilling industries as qualified to perform the tasks for which such firm has been engaged as to the fairness to the Borrower or such Restricted Subsidiary of such Affiliate Transaction from a financial point of view or that the terms of such Affiliate Transaction are no less favorable to the Borrower or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that could have been obtained in a comparable arm’s-length transaction by the Borrower or such Restricted Subsidiary with a Person that is not an Affiliate of the Borrower.


For the avoidance of doubt, with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions involving aggregate consideration of $25 million or less, the determination that such Affiliate Transaction or series of Affiliate Transactions complies with this Section 6.05 may be made by a Financial Officer of the Borrower.


(b)        The following items will not be deemed to be Affiliate Transactions, as applicable, and, therefore, will not be subject to the provisions of Section 6.05(a):






 

100




			 

		



(i)         any employment agreement, employee benefit plan, compensation plan or arrangement, officer or director indemnification agreement or any similar arrangement entered into by the Borrower or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business and payments pursuant thereto;

(vii)      Permitted Investments (other than Investments permitted by clause (3) of the definition thereof) and Restricted Payments that do not violate the provisions of Section 6.01;


(viii)    transactions between the Borrower or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries and any Person that would not otherwise constitute an Affiliate Transaction except for the fact that one director of such other Person is also a director of the Borrower or such Restricted Subsidiary, as applicable; provided that such director abstains from voting as a director of the Borrower or such Restricted Subsidiary, as applicable, on any matter involving such other Person; and


(ix)       any agreement as in effect on the Closing Date or any amendments, renewals or extensions of any such agreement (so long as such amendments, renewals or extensions are not less favorable to the Lenders).


SECTION 6.06     Limitation on Liens.  The Borrower will not, and will not permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create, incur, assume or suffer to exist (i) any Lien of any kind on any Collateral for the Indebtedness under the Loan Documents, except for Permitted Collateral Liens, or (ii) any Lien of any kind securing Indebtedness on any of its property or assets that are not Collateral for the Indebtedness under the Loan Documents, except for Permitted Liens.


SECTION 6.07      Business Activities.  The Borrower will not, and will not permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, engage in any business other than Permitted

ARTICLE VIII


Agency


SECTION 8.01    Appointment and Authority.  Each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably appoints (i) Angelo, Gordon Energy Servicer, LLC, to act on its behalf as the Administrative Agent and (ii) Wilmington Trust, National Association, to act on its behalf as the Collateral Agent (for purposes of this Article VIII, the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent are referred to collectively as the “Agents”), in each case, hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and authorizes the Agents to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Agents by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.  Except as otherwise provided in Section 8.06(b), the provisions of this Article are solely for the benefit of the Agents and the Lenders, and neither the Borrower nor any other Loan Party shall have rights as a third-party beneficiary of any of such provisions.  It is understood and agreed that the use of the term “agent” herein or in any other Loan Documents (or any other similar term) with reference to the Agents is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law.  Instead such term is used as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting parties.






 

105




			 

		



SECTION 8.02      Rights as a Lender.  The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and the term “Lender” or “Lenders” shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity.  Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, own securities of, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for, and generally engage in any kind of business with, the Borrower or any Subsidiary of the Borrower or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.


SECTION 8.03     Exculpatory Provisions.  (a)  Neither Agent shall have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, and its duties hereunder shall be administrative in nature.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither Agent:


(i)         shall be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing;


(ii)        shall have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that such Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents); provided that neither Agent shall be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose such Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law, including for the avoidance of doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any Debtor Relief Law or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any Debtor Relief Law; and


(iii)      shall, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as an Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.


(b)        Neither Agent shall be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary), or as such Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.07, or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment.  The Agents shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until notice describing such Default is given to such Agent in writing by the Borrower or a Lender.


(c)        The Agents shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this






 

106




			 

		



Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Agents.


SECTION 8.04      Reliance by Agents.  Each Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person.  Each Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon.  In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender prior to the making of such Loan.  Each Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.


SECTION 8.05     Delegation of Duties.  Each Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub‑agents appointed by such Agent.  Each Agent and any such sub‑agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties.  The exculpatory provisions of this Article VIII shall apply to any such sub‑agent and to the Related Parties of each Agent and any such sub‑agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the arranging of the Credit Facilities provided for by this Agreement as well as activities as an Agent.  Neither Agent shall be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any sub-agents except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and non appealable judgment that such Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such sub‑agents.


SECTION 8.06      Resignation of Agents.  (a)  Each Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders and the Borrower.  Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the Borrower, to appoint a successor, which, in the case of the Administrative Agent, shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank.  If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its resignation (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the “Resignation Effective Date”), then the retiring Agent may (but shall not be obligated to), on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above.  Whether or not a successor has been appointed, such resignation shall become effective in accordance with such notice on the Resignation Effective Date.






 

107




			 

		



(b)        If the Person serving as Administrative Agent is a Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (d) of the definition thereof, the Required Lenders may, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, by notice in writing to the Borrower and such Person remove such Person as Administrative Agent and, in consultation with the Borrower, appoint a successor.  If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the “Removal Effective Date”), then such removal shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice on the Removal Effective Date.


(c)        With effect from the Resignation Effective Date (1) the retiring or removed Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (except that in the case of any Collateral held by the Collateral Agent on behalf of the Secured Parties under any of the Loan Documents, the retiring or removed Collateral Agent shall continue to hold such Collateral until such time as a successor Collateral Agent is appointed) and (2) all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through such Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender directly, until such time, if any, as a successor Agent is appointed as provided for above.  Upon the acceptance of a successor’s appointment as an Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring or removed Agent, and the retiring or removed Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents.  The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor Agent.  After the retiring or removed Agent’s resignation or removal hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article VIII and Section 9.04 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring or removed Agent, its sub‑agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring or removed Agent was acting as an Agent.


SECTION 8.07    Non-Reliance on Agents and Other Lenders.  Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Agents or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement.  Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agents or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.


SECTION 8.08     Administrative Agent May File Proofs of Claim.  In case of the pendency of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or any other judicial proceeding relative to any Loan Party, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan or any other Obligation shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered (but not obligated) by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise:






 

108




			 

		



(a)        to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans and all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders, the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders, the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders, the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent under Sections 2.05 and 9.04) allowed in such judicial proceeding; and


(b)        to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;


and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.05 and 9.04.


SECTION 8.09      Collateral and Guarantee Matters.  (a)  The Bank Secured Parties irrevocably authorize and direct (i) the Collateral Agent to execute and deliver the Security Agreement and to exercise and enforce its rights and remedies and perform its obligations thereunder and (ii) the Administrative Agent to execute and deliver the Guarantee Agreement and to exercise and enforce its rights and remedies and perform its obligations thereunder and to release any Subsidiary Guarantor from its obligations under the Guarantee Agreement if such Person ceases to be a Subsidiary of the Borrower as a result of a transaction permitted under the Loan Documents.


Upon request by the Administrative Agent at any time, the Required Lenders will confirm in writing the Administrative Agent’s authority to release any Guarantor from its obligations under the Guarantee Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.09(a) and the Collateral Agent’s authority to release any Collateral from the Lien of the Collateral Agent pursuant to Section 9.18 of the Security Agreement.


No Bank Secured Party other than the Administrative Agent (or any sub-agent thereof), as applicable, shall have any right individually to realize upon any of the Collateral or to enforce any Guarantee of the Loan Document Obligations, it being understood and agreed that all powers, rights and remedies under the Loan Documents may be exercised solely by the Collateral Agent or the Administrative Agent (or any sub-agent thereof), as applicable, on behalf of the Bank Secured Parties in accordance with the terms thereof


(b)        The Agents shall not be responsible for or have a duty to ascertain or inquire into any representation or warranty regarding the existence, value or collectability of the Collateral, the existence, priority or perfection of the Collateral Agent’s Lien thereon, or any certificate prepared by any Loan Party in connection therewith, nor shall the Collateral Agent be






 

109




			 

		



responsible or liable to the Administrative Agent, the Lenders or any other Person for any failure to monitor or maintain any portion of the Collateral or monitor or maintain the perfection of the Collateral Agent’s Lien on any Collateral.


SECTION 8.10     Security Agreement.  Each Lender agrees that it will be bound by, and shall take no actions contrary to (and shall take all actions required by), the provisions of the Security Agreement, the Collateral Agency Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement and authorizes (i) the Administrative Agent to enter into the Collateral Agency Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement on its behalf and (ii) the Collateral Agent to enter into the Security Agreement, the Collateral Agency Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement on its behalf and to act on its behalf to the extent set forth in the Collateral Documents.  The Lenders acknowledge that the Collateral Agency Agreement provides for the allocation of proceeds of Collateral among the Secured Parties as set forth therein and contains limits on the ability of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders to take remedial actions with respect to the Collateral.  The Lenders acknowledge that the Secured Obligations are secured by the Collateral on a pari passu basis to the extent set forth in the Security Agreement and the Collateral Agency Agreement and the ability of the Collateral Agent to take remedial actions with respect to the Collateral is subject to the provisions of the Collateral Agency Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement.


SECTION 8.11      Certain ERISA Matters.


(a)        Each Lender (x) represents and warrants, as of the date such Person became a Lender party hereto, to, and (y) covenants, from the date such Person became a Lender party hereto to the date such Person ceases being a Lender party hereto, for the benefit of, the Administrative Agent and not, for the avoidance of doubt, to or for the benefit of the Borrower or any other Loan Party, that at least one of the following is and will be true:

The Borrower hereby agrees, unless directed otherwise by the Administrative Agent or unless the e-mail address referred to in this paragraph has not been provided by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower, that it will, or will cause the Subsidiaries to, provide the Communications to the Administrative Agent in an electronic/soft medium that is properly identified in a format acceptable to the Administrative Agent to an e-mail address as directed by the Administrative Agent.  In addition, the Borrower agrees, and agrees to cause the Subsidiaries, to continue to provide the Communications to the Administrative Agent or the Lenders, as the case may be, in the manner otherwise specified in the Loan Documents but only to the extent requested by the Administrative Agent.


The Borrower hereby acknowledges that (a) the Administrative Agent will make available to the Lenders materials and/or information provided by or on behalf of the Borrower hereunder (collectively, the “Borrower Materials”) by posting the Borrower Materials on the Platform and (b) certain of the Lenders may be “public-side” Lenders (i.e., Lenders that do not wish to receive material non-public information with respect to the Borrower or its securities) (each, a “Public Lender”).  The Borrower hereby agrees that (i) all Borrower Materials that are to be made available to Public Lenders shall be clearly and conspicuously marked “PUBLIC” which, at a minimum, shall mean that the word “PUBLIC” shall appear prominently on the first page thereof; (ii) by marking Borrower Materials “PUBLIC,” the Borrower shall be deemed to have authorized the Administrative Agent and the Lenders to treat such Borrower Materials as not containing any material non-public information with respect to the Borrower or its securities for purposes of United States Federal and state securities laws (provided, however, that to the extent such Borrower Materials constitute Information, they shall be treated as set forth in Section 9.13); (iii) all Borrower Materials marked “PUBLIC” are permitted to be made available through a portion of the Platform designated as “Public Investor;” and (iv) the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to treat any Borrower Materials that are not marked “PUBLIC” as being suitable only for posting on a portion of the Platform not marked as “Public Investor” and shall post the same only on such portion.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following Borrower Materials shall be marked “PUBLIC”, unless the Borrower notifies the Administrative Agent promptly that any such document contains material non-public information:  (A) the Loan Documents and (B) notification of changes in the terms of the Credit Facilities provided for by this Agreement.


Each Public Lender agrees to cause at least one individual at or on behalf of such Public Lender to at all times have selected the “Private Side Information” or similar designation



 

113




			 

		



on the content declaration screen of the Platform in order to enable such Public Lender or its delegate, in accordance with such Public Lender’s compliance procedures and applicable law, including United States Federal and state securities laws, to make reference to Communications that are not made available through the “Public Side Information” portion of the Platform and that may contain material non-public information with respect to the Borrower or its securities for purposes of United States Federal or state securities laws.


The Administrative Agent agrees that the receipt of the Communications by the Administrative Agent at its e-mail address set forth above shall constitute effective delivery of the Communications to the Administrative Agent for purposes of the Loan Documents.  Each Lender agrees that receipt of notice to it (as provided in the next sentence) specifying that the Communications have been posted to the Platform shall constitute effective delivery of the Communications to such Lender for purposes of the Loan Documents.  Each Lender agrees to notify the Administrative Agent in writing (including by electronic communication) from time to time of such Lender’s e-mail address to which the foregoing notice may be sent by electronic transmission and that the foregoing notice may be sent to such e-mail address.


Nothing herein shall prejudice the right of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to give any notice or other communication pursuant to any Loan Document in any other manner specified in such Loan Document.


SECTION 9.02      Survival of Agreement.  All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the Borrower herein and in the certificates or other instruments prepared or delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be considered to have been relied upon by the Lenders and shall survive the making by the Lenders of the Loans regardless of any investigation made by the Lenders or on their behalf, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any Yield Maintenance Amount or any Fee or any other amount payable under this Agreement or any other Loan Document is outstanding and unpaid and so long as the Commitments have not been terminated.  The provisions of Sections 2.12, 2.16 (subject to the requirements of Section 2.16) and 9.04 shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of the expiration of the term of this Agreement, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of any of the Loans, the expiration of the Commitments, the invalidity or unenforceability of any term or provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or any investigation made by or on behalf of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender.


SECTION 9.03     Successors and Assigns.  (a)  Successors and Assigns Generally.  Whenever in this Agreement any of the parties hereto is referred to, such reference shall be deemed to include the permitted successors and assigns of such party; and all covenants, promises and agreements by or on behalf of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or the Lenders that are contained in this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and each Lender, and no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder except (i) to an assignee in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b) of this Section 9.03,



 

114




			 

		



(ii) by way of participation in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (d) of this Section 9.03, or (iii) by way of pledge or assignment of a security interest subject to the restrictions of paragraph (f) of this Section 9.03 (and any other attempted assignment or transfer by any party hereto shall be null and void).  Nothing in this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants to the extent provided in paragraph (d) of this Section 9.03, the Collateral Agent and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents.


(b)        Assignments by Lenders.  Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it); provided that any such assignment shall be subject to the following conditions:


(i)         Minimum Amounts.


(A)       in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender’s Commitment and/or the Loans at the time owing to it or contemporaneous assignments to related Approved Funds that equal at least the amount specified in paragraph (b)(i)(B) of this Section 9.03 in the aggregate or in the case of an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund, no minimum amount need be assigned; and


(B)       in any case not described in paragraph (b)(i)(A) of this Section 9.03, the aggregate amount of the Commitment (which for this purpose includes Loans outstanding thereunder) or, if the applicable Commitment is not then in effect, the principal outstanding balance of the Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if “Trade Date” is specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade Date) shall not be less than $1,000,000 unless each of the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower otherwise consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).


(ii)        Proportionate Amounts.  Each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Loan or the Commitment assigned.


(iii)      Required Consents.  No consent shall be required for any assignment except to the extent required by paragraph (b)(i)(B) of this Section 9.03 and, in addition, the consent of (A) the Administrative Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) shall be required for any assignment if such assignment is to a Person that is not a Lender and (B) during the Effective Availability Period and as long as no Default or Event of Default exists at such time, the






 

115




			 

		



Borrower; provided that the consent of the Borrower shall be solely based on the ability of the assignee to meet the funding obligations set forth herein (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).


(iv)       Assignment and Assumption.  The parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500; provided that the Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, elect to waive such processing and recordation fee in the case of any assignment.  The assignee, if it is not a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire an IRS Form W-9 or and any tax forms required by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent to support such assignee’s position that no withholding is required in respect of any amount received hereunder and all documentation and other information required by regulatory authorities under applicable “know your customer” and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including, without limitation, the USA PATRIOT Act.


(v)        No Assignment to Certain Persons.  No such assignment shall be made to (A) the Borrower or any of the Borrower’s Affiliates or Subsidiaries or (B) any Defaulting Lender or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Person who, upon becoming a Lender hereunder, would constitute any of the foregoing Persons described in this clause (B).


(vi)       No Assignment to Natural Persons.  No such assignment shall be made to a natural Person (or a holding company, investment vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated for the primary benefit of, a natural Person).


(vii)      Certain Additional Payments.  In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments to the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with the consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Loans previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent and each other Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon), and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro rata share of all Loans in accordance with its Applicable Commitment Percentage.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under applicable law without compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs.


Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section 9.03, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to



 

116




			 

		



the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.12, 2.16 (subject to the requirements of Section 2.16) and 9.04 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment; provided, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no assignment by a Defaulting Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender’s having been a Defaulting Lender.  Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this paragraph shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (d) of this Section 9.03.


(c)        Register.  The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices in The City of New York a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts of and interest on the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the “Register”).  The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement.  The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior written notice.  Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, an Administrative Questionnaire completed in respect of the assignee (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) above, if applicable, the consent of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower to such assignment, if applicable, and any applicable Tax forms, the Administrative Agent shall (i) accept such Assignment and Assumption and (ii) record the information contained therein in the Register.  No assignment shall be effective unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this Section 9.03(c).


(d)        Participations.  Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural Person or the Borrower or any of the Borrower’s Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a “Participant”) in all or a portion of such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing to it); provided,  however, that (i) such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, and (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement.  For the avoidance of doubt, each Lender shall be responsible for the indemnity under Section 2.15(c) with respect to any payments made by such Lender to its Participant(s).






 

117




			 

		



Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver decreasing any fees payable to such Participant hereunder or the amount of principal of or the rate at which interest is payable on the Loans in which such Participant has an interest, extending any scheduled principal payment date or date fixed for the payment of interest on the Loans in which such Participant has an interest, increasing or extending the Commitments in which such Participant has an interest or releasing all or substantially all of the value of the Guarantees or all or substantially all of the Collateral.  The Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.12(a) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 9.03; provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to the provisions of Sections 2.12(b) and 2.12(c) as if it were an assignee under paragraph (b) of this Section 9.03.  To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.05 as though it were a Lender; provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.14 as though it were a Lender.  Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant’s interest in the Loans or other obligations under this Agreement (the “Participant Register”); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant’s interest in any Commitments, Loans or its other obligations under this Agreement or any other Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Commitment, Loan or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations.  The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.


(e)        Limitations upon Participant Rights.  A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 2.12 and 2.16 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, except (i) if the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower’s prior written consent or (ii) to the extent that such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a change in or in the interpretation of any law that occurs after the Participant acquired the participation.  A Participant shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.16 unless the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section 2.16(f) as though it were a Lender (it being understood and agreed that the documentation required under Section 2.16(f) shall be delivered to the participating Lender).


(f)        Certain Pledges.  Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such






 

118




			 

		



Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.


(g)        Any Lender or participant may, in connection with any assignment or participation or proposed assignment or participation pursuant to this Section 9.03, disclose to the assignee or Participant or proposed assignee or Participant any information relating to the Borrower furnished to such Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower; provided that, prior to any such disclosure of information designated by the Borrower as confidential, each such assignee or Participant or proposed assignee or Participant shall execute an agreement whereby such assignee or Participant shall agree (subject to customary exceptions) to preserve the confidentiality of such confidential information on terms no less restrictive than those applicable to the Lenders pursuant to Section 9.13.


(h)        Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, and in accordance with 9.03(a), any Lender (a “Granting Lender”) may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle (an “SPV”), identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Lender to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, the option to provide to the Borrower all or any part of any Loan that such Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to make to the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement; provided that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPV to make any Loan and (ii) if an SPV elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to provide all or any part of such Loan, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to make such Loan pursuant to the terms hereof.  The making of a Loan by an SPV hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting Lender to the same extent, and as if, such Loan were made by such Granting Lender.  Each party hereto hereby agrees that neither the grant to any SPV nor the exercise by any SPV of such option shall increase the costs or expenses or otherwise increase or change the obligations of the Borrower or any other Loan Party under this Agreement, and no SPV shall be liable for any indemnity or similar payment obligation under this Agreement (all liability for which shall remain with the Granting Lender).  In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby agrees (which agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement) that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding commercial paper or other senior indebtedness of any SPV, it will not institute against, or join any other Person in instituting against, such SPV any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings under the laws of the United States of America or any State thereof.  In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 9.03, any SPV may (i) with notice to, but without the prior written consent of, the Borrower and the Administrative Agent and without paying any processing fee therefor, assign all or a portion of its interests in any Loans to the Granting Lender or to any financial institutions (consented to by the Borrower and Administrative Agent) providing liquidity and/or credit support to or for the account of such SPV to support the funding or maintenance of Loans and (ii) disclose on a confidential basis any non-public information relating to its Loans to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety, guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancement to such SPV.


(i)         The Borrower shall not assign or delegate any of its rights or duties hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and each Lender, and any attempted assignment without such consent shall be null and void.

SECTION 9.04      Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver.  (a)  Costs and Expenses.  The Borrower shall pay (i) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent, its Affiliates and the Collateral Agent (including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of one primary counsel to the Administrative Agent and its Affiliates, one primary counsel to the Collateral Agent, one local counsel in each relevant jurisdiction, one special counsel in each relevant specialty and, in the event of any actual or potential conflict of interest, one additional counsel in each relevant jurisdiction for each Person subject to such conflict), in connection with the arranging of the Credit Facilities provided for by this Agreement, the preparation, negotiation, execution, delivery and administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, or any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof or thereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be consummated) and (ii) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender (including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of one primary counsel to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, one primary counsel to the Collateral Agent, one local counsel in each relevant jurisdiction, one special counsel in each relevant specialty and, in the event of any actual or potential conflict of interest, one additional counsel in each relevant jurisdiction for each Person subject to such conflict), in connection with the enforcement or protection of its rights (A) in connection with this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, including its rights under this Section 9.04(a), or (B) in connection with the Loans made hereunder, including all such reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred during any workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect of such Loans.


(b)        Indemnification by the Borrower.  The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent (and any sub-agent thereof), the Collateral Agent, each Lender, and each Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an “Indemnitee”) against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses (including the fees, charges and disbursements of one primary counsel to the Indemnitees, one local counsel in each relevant jurisdiction, one special counsel in each relevant specialty and, in the event of any actual or potential conflict of interest, one additional counsel in each relevant jurisdiction for each Person subject to such conflict), incurred by any Indemnitee or asserted against any Indemnitee by any Person (including the Borrower or any other Loan Party) other than such Indemnitee and its Related Parties arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby, the performance by the parties hereto of their respective obl

the use or proposed use of the proceeds therefrom, (iii) any actual or alleged presence or Release of Hazardous Materials on or from any property owned or operated by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Environmental Liability related in any way to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iv) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory, whether brought by a third party or by the Borrower or any other Loan Party, and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto; provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses (x) are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee or (y) in the case of Indemnitees other than the Collateral Agent, result from a claim brought by the Borrower or any






 

120




			 

		



other Loan Party against an Indemnitee for breach in bad faith of such Indemnitee’s obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document, if the Borrower or such Loan Party has obtained a final and nonappealable judgment in its favor on such claim as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction.  Paragraph (b) of this Section shall not apply with respect to Taxes other than any Taxes that represent losses, claims, damages, etc. arising from any non-Tax claim.


(c)        Reimbursement by Lenders.  To the extent that the Borrower for any reason fails to indefeasibly pay any amount required under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 9.04 to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent (or any sub-agent thereof), the Collateral Agent or any Related Party of any of the foregoing, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent), the Collateral Agent or such Related Party, as the case may be, such Lender’s pro rata share (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought based on each Lender’s share of the Total Credit Exposure at such time) of such unpaid amount (including any such unpaid amount in respect of a claim asserted by such Lender); provided, that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent), the Collateral Agent or against any Related Party of any of the foregoing acting for the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent), or the Collateral Agent.


(d)        Waiver of Consequential Damages, Etc.  To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower shall not assert, and hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, any Loan or the use of the proceeds thereof.  No Indemnitee referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section 9.04 shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by unintended recipients of any information or other materials distributed by it through telecommunications, electronic or other information transmission systems in connection with this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.


(e)        Payments.  All amounts due under this Section 9.04 shall be payable promptly after demand therefor.


(f)        Survival.  The provisions of, and each party’s obligations under, this Section 9.04 shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of the expiration or termination of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of any of the Loans, the expiration of the Commitments, the invalidity or unenforceability of any term or provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, any investigation made by or on behalf of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender or the resignation or removal of the Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent.


SECTION 9.05     Right of Setoff.  If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender and each of their respective Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, to set off and apply






 

121




			 

		



any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, in whatever currency) at any time held, and other obligations (in whatever currency) at any time owing, by such Lender or any such Affiliate, to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower against any and all of the obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Agreement or any other Loan Document to such Lender or its respective Affiliates, irrespective of whether or not such Lender or such Affiliate shall have made any demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and although such obligations of the Borrower may be contingent or unmatured or are owed to a branch, office or Affiliate of such Lender different from the branch, office or Affiliate holding such deposit or obligated on such indebtedness; provided that in the event that any Defaulting Lender shall exercise any such right of setoff, (x) all amounts so set off shall be paid over immediately to the Administrative Agent for further application in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.18 and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and (y) the Defaulting Lender shall provide promptly to the Administrative Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the Obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as to which it exercised such right of setoff.  The rights of each Lender and its respective Affiliates under this Section 9.05 are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that such Lender or its respective Affiliates may have.  Each Lender agrees to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent promptly after any such setoff and application; provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application.


SECTION 9.06     Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Etc.    (a)  Governing Law.  This Agreement and the other Loan Documents and any claims, controversy, dispute or cause of action (whether in contract or tort or otherwise) based upon, arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document (except, as to any other Loan Document, as expressly set forth therein) and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the law of the State of New York (without regard to principles of conflict of laws).


(b)        Jurisdiction.  The Borrower irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that it will not commence any action, litigation or proceeding of any kind or description, whether in law or equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Related Party of the foregoing in any way relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the transactions relating hereto or thereto, in any forum other than the courts of the State of New York sitting in New York County, and of the United States District Court of the Southern District of New York, and any appellate court from any thereof, and each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the jurisdiction of such  courts and agrees that all claims in respect of any such action, litigation or proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York State court or, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in such federal court.  Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action, litigation or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.  Nothing in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document shall affect any right that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document against the Borrower or its properties in the courts of any jurisdiction.






 

122




			 

		



(c)        Waiver of Venue.  The Borrower irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document in any court referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section 9.06.  Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.


(d)        Service of Process.  Each party hereto irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 9.01.  Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party hereto to serve process in any other manner permitted by applicable law.


SECTION 9.07      Waivers; Amendment.  (a)  No failure or delay of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender in exercising any power or right hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power.  The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, and the Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have.  No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or consent to any departure by the Borrower or any other Loan Party therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section 9.07, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given.  No notice or demand on the Borrower in any case shall entitle the Borrower to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.


(b)        Neither this Agreement nor any other Loan Document nor any provision hereof or thereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrower and the Required Lenders (with a fully executed copy delivered to the Administrative Agent); provided,  however, that no such agreement shall:


(i)         decrease the principal amount of, or extend the maturity of or any scheduled principal payment date or date for the payment of any interest or Yield Maintenance Amount on any Loan, or waive or excuse any such payment or any part thereof, or decrease the rate of interest or Yield Maintenance Amount on any Loan, without the prior written consent of each Lender directly adversely affected thereby,


(ii)        increase or extend the Commitment or waive, decrease or extend the date for payment of any Fees of any Lender without the prior written consent of such Lender,


(iii)      without the prior written consent of each Lender, amend or modify the pro rata requirements of Section 2.13, the provisions of Section 9.03(i) or the






 

123




			 

		



provisions of this Section 9.07 or release all or substantially all of the value of the Guarantees or all or substantially all of the Collateral,


(iv)       modify the protections afforded to an SPV pursuant to the provisions of Section 9.03(h) without the written consent of such SPV,


(v)        reduce the percentage contained in the definition of the term “Required Lenders” without the prior written consent of each Lender, or


(vi)       if any Lender shall hold 50% or more of the aggregate Total Credit Exposures of all Lenders, amend or modify Section 4.02 of the U.S. Security Agreement without the prior written consent of such Lender and one additional Lender; provided further that no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent hereunder or under any other Loan Document without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent.


(c)        The Administrative Agent and the Borrower may amend any Loan Document to correct administrative or manifest errors or omissions, or to effect administrative changes that are not adverse to any Lender; provided,  however, that no such amendment shall become effective until the fifth Business Day after it has been delivered to the Lenders or otherwise posted for their attention on the Platform, and then only if the Required Lenders have not objected in writing thereto within such five Business Day period.


SECTION 9.08     Interest Rate Limitation.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if at any time the interest rate applicable to any Loan, together with all fees, charges and other amounts which are treated as interest on such Loan under applicable law (collectively the “Charges”), shall exceed the maximum lawful rate (the “Maximum Rate”) which may be contracted for, charged, taken, received or reserved by the Lender holding such Loan or participation in accordance with applicable law, the rate of interest payable in respect of such Loan or participation hereunder, together with all Charges payable in respect thereof, shall be limited to the Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful, the interest and Charges that would have been payable in respect of such Loan or participation but were not payable as a result of the operation of this Section 9.08 shall be cumulated and the interest and Charges payable to such Lender in respect of other Loans or participations or periods shall be increased (but not above the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount, together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Effective Rate to the date of repayment, shall have been received by such Lender.  Any amount collected by such Lender that exceeds the maximum amount collectible at the Maximum Rate shall be applied to the reduction of the principal balance of such Loan or refunded to the Borrower so that at no time shall the interest and charges paid or payable in respect of such Loan exceed the maximum amount collectible at the Maximum Rate.


SECTION 9.09      WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.  EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER, IN CONNECTION WITH OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN






 

124

SECTION 9.11     Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness; Electronic Execution.  (a)  Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness.  This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto in different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract.  This Agreement and the other Loan Documents constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof.  Except as provided in Section 4.02, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof that, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto.  Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by facsimile or in electronic (i.e., “pdf” or “tif”) format shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.


(b)        Electronic Execution of Assignments.  The words “execution”,  “signed”,  “signature” and words of like import in any Assignment and Assumption shall be deemed to include electronic signatures or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent and as provided for in any applicable law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act, or any other similar state laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act.

126




			 

		



time to time to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, as applicable.  This notice is given in accordance with the requirements of the USA PATRIOT Act and the Beneficial Ownership Regulation and is effective for each Lender and the Administrative Agent.


SECTION 9.15      Lender Action.  Each Lender agrees that it shall not take or institute any actions or proceedings, judicial or otherwise, for any right or remedy against any Loan Party or any other obligor under any of the Loan Documents (including the exercise of any right of setoff, rights on account of any banker’s lien or similar claim or other rights of self-help), or institute any actions or proceedings, or otherwise commence any remedial procedures, with respect to any Collateral or any other property of any such Loan Party, unless expressly provided for herein or in any other Loan Document, without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent.  The provisions of this Section 9.15 are for the sole benefit of the Lenders and shall not afford any right to, or constitute a defense available to, any Loan Party.


SECTION 9.16    Application of Proceeds.  Subject to the Collateral Agency Agreement, upon receipt from the Collateral Agent of the proceeds of any collection, sale, foreclosure or other realization upon any Collateral, including any Collateral consisting of cash, following the exercise of remedies provided for in Article VII (or after the Loans have automatically become due and payable as set forth in Article VII), the Administrative Agent shall apply such proceeds as follows:


FIRST, to the payment of all costs and expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as such hereunder or under any other Loan Document) in connection with such collection, sale, foreclosure or realization or otherwise in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, including all court costs and the fees and expenses of its agents and legal counsel, the repayment of all advances made by the Administrative Agent hereunder or under any other Loan Document on behalf of any Loan Party and any other costs or expenses incurred in connection with the exercise of any right or remedy hereunder or under any other Loan Document; and


SECOND, to the payment in full of all other Loan Document Obligations (the amounts so applied to be distributed among the Bank Secured Parties pro rata in accordance with the amounts of the Loan Document Obligations owed to them on the date of any such distribution).


The Administrative Agent shall apply any such proceeds, moneys or balances in accordance with this Agreement promptly after receipt thereof.


SECTION 9.17      Third Party Beneficiary.  The Collateral Agent shall be a third-party beneficiary of Article VIII and Sections 4.02, 5.12, 9.01, 9.04, 9.06, 9.09, 9.18, and shall have the right to enforce such Article VIII and Sections 4.02, 5.12, 9.01, 9.04, 9.06, 9.09, 9.18 directly to the extent the Collateral Agent may deem such enforcement necessary or advisable to protect the Collateral Agent’s rights.


SECTION 9.18     Release of Collateral and Guarantees.  (a)  All security interests and Liens granted or created under the Collateral Documents shall automatically terminate when all the Loan Document Obligations (other than contingent amounts not yet due)






 

127




			 

		



have been paid in full and the Lenders have no further commitment to lend under this Agreement.


(b)        A Subsidiary Guarantor shall automatically be released from its obligations under the Collateral Documents and all security interests and Liens granted or created thereunder in the Collateral and guarantee obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor shall be automatically released and/or terminated upon the consummation of any transaction permitted by this Agreement as a result of which such Subsidiary Guarantor ceases to be a Subsidiary of the Borrower or, upon the Borrower’s written request, becomes an Unrestricted Subsidiary.


(c)        Upon any sale or other transfer by any Loan Party of any Collateral that is permitted under this Agreement to any Person that is not another Loan Party, or, upon the effectiveness of any written consent required for the release of the security interest or Lien granted under the Collateral Documents in any Collateral pursuant to Section 9.07 (or, if later, the date such release is permitted to occur pursuant to such consent), the security interests and Liens in such Collateral shall be automatically released.


(d)        In connection with any termination or release pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) above or with respect to the sale or transfer of any asset constituting Collateral, if such Collateral is sold or otherwise disposed of to the Borrower or a Guarantor in a transaction permitted by the terms of this Agreement; provided that such Collateral shall be pledged as Collateral under the Collateral Documents contemporaneously with such partial release of Liens and sale or disposition to the Borrower or a Guarantor, in accordance with the requirements of this Agreement and the Collateral Documents, upon receipt of a certificate of a Responsible Officer, the Collateral Agent shall promptly execute and deliver to any Loan Party, at such Loan Party’s expense, all Uniform Commercial Code termination statements and other documents that such Loan Party shall reasonably request to evidence such termination or release.  Any execution and delivery of documents pursuant to this Section 9.18 shall be without recourse to or representation or warranty by the Collateral Agent or any Secured Party.  Without limiting the provisions of Section 9.04, the Borrower shall reimburse the Collateral Agent upon demand for all reasonable and documented costs and out-of-pocket expenses, including the reasonable and documented fees, charges and expenses of counsel, incurred by it in connection with any action contemplated by this Section 9.18.


SECTION 9.19    Acknowledgement and Consent to Bail-In of EEA Financial Institutions.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Loan Document or in any other agreement, arrangement or understanding among any such parties, each party hereto acknowledges that any liability of any EEA Financial Institution arising under any Loan Document, to the extent such liability is unsecured, may be subject to the write-down and conversion powers of an EEA Resolution Authority and agrees and consents to, and acknowledges and agrees to be bound by:


(a)        the application of any Write-Down and Conversion Powers by an EEA Resolution Authority to any such liabilities arising hereunder which may be payable to it by any party hereto that is an EEA Financial Institution; and






 

128




			 

		



(b)        the effects of any Bail-In Action on any such liability, including, if applicable (i) a reduction in full or in part or cancellation of any such liability; (ii) a conversion of all, or a portion of, such liability into shares or other instruments of ownership in such EEA Financial Institution, its parent entity, or a bridge institution that may be issued to it or otherwise conferred on it, and that such shares or other instruments of ownership will be accepted by it in lieu of any rights with respect to any such liability under this Agreement or any other Loan Document; or (iii) the variation of the terms of such liability in connection with the exercise of the write-down and conversion powers of any EEA Resolution Authority.


SECTION 9.20      Recognition of the U.S. Special Resolution Regimes.  In the event that any Lender that is a Covered Entity becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, the transfer from such Lender of this Agreement, and any interest and obligation in or under this Agreement, will be effective to the same extent as the transfer would be effective under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if this Agreement, and any such interest and obligation, were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States.  In the event that any Lender that is a Covered Entity or a BHC Act Affiliate of such Lender becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, Default Rights under this Agreement that may be exercised against such Lender are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such Default Rights could be exercised under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if this Agreement were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States.
