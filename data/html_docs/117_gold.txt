uly 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that, after the end of 2021, it would no longer persuade or compel contributing banks to make rate submissions to the ICE Benchmark Administration (together with any successor to the ICE Benchmark Administrator, the “IBA”) for purposes of the IBA setting the London interbank offered rate. As a result, it is possible that commencing in 2022, the London interbank offered rate may no longer be available or may no longer be deemed an appropriate reference rate upon which to determine the interest rate on LIBOR Loans or LIBOR Daily Loans.  In light of this eventuality, public and private sector industry initiatives are currently underway to identify new or alternative reference rates to be used in place of the London interbank offered rate.  Upon the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event, a Term SOFR Transition Event or an Early Opt-In Election, Section 3.8 provides the mechanism for determining an alternative rate of interest.  Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower, pursuant to Section 3.8, of any change to the reference rate upon which the interest rate on LIBOR Loans and LIBOR Daily Loans is based.  However, Administrative Agent does not warrant or accept any responsibility for, and shall not have any liability with respect to, the administration, submission or any other matter related to the London interbank offered rate or other rates in the definition of “Base LIBOR” or “LIBO Screen Rate” or with respect to any alternative or successor rate thereto, or replacement rate thereof (including, without limitation, (i) any such alternative, successor or replacement rate implemented pursuant to Section 3.8, whether upon the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event, a Term SOFR Transition Event or an Early Opt-in Election, and (ii) the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes pursuant to Section 3.8), including without limitation, whether the composition or characteristics of any such alternative, successor or replacement reference rate will be similar to, or produce the same value or economic equivalence of, LIBOR or the LIBOR Daily Rate or have the same volume or liquidity as did the Londo

No Issuing Lender shall at any time be obligated to issue any Letter of Credit hereunder if (v) any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain such Issuing Lender from issuing such Letter of Credit, or any applicable law applicable to such Issuing Lender or any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over such Issuing Lender shall prohibit, or request that such Issuing Lender refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit generally or such Letter of Credit in particular or shall impose upon such Issuing Lender with respect to letters of credit generally or such Letter of Credit in particular any restriction or reserve or capital requirement (for which such Issuing Lender is not otherwise compensated) not in effect on the Closing Date, or any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense that was not applicable, in effect or known to such Issuing Lender as of the Closing Date (or such later date such Person first became an Issuing Lender hereunder) and that such Issuing Lender in good faith deems material to it, (w) the conditions set forth in Section 5.2 are not satisfied, (x) the issuance of such Letter of Credit would violate one or more policies of such Issuing Lender applicable to letters of credit issued by it generally, (y) the proceeds of which would be made available to any Person (I) to fund any activity or business of or with any Sanctioned Person, or in any Sanctioned Country or (II) in any manner that would result in a violation of any Sanctions by any party to this Agreement or (z) any Lender is at that time a Defaulting Lender, unless such Issuing Lender has entered into arrangements, including the delivery of Cash Collateral, satisfactory to such Issuing Lender (in its sole discretion) with the Borrower or such Lender to eliminate such Issuing Lender’s actual or potential Fronting Exposure (after giving effect to Section 3.7) with respect to the Defaulting Lender arising from either the Letter of Credit then proposed to be issued by such Issuing Lender or that Letter of Credit and all other L/C Obligations as to which such Issuing Lender has actual or potential Fronting Exposure, as it may elect in its sole discretion.  References herein to “issue” and derivations thereof with respect to Letters of Credit shall also include extensions or modifications of any outstanding Letters of Credit, unless the context otherwise requires. On and after the Closing Date, each of the Existing Letters of Credit shall constitute, for all purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, a Letter of Credit issued and outstanding hereunder.33(iii)Defaulting Lenders.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Section 2.1B shall be subject to the terms and conditions of Section 3.7 and Section 3.10.(b)Procedure for Issuance of Letters of Credit.  The Borrower may from time to time request that an Issuing Lender issue, amend, renew or extend a Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender by delivering to such Issuing Lender at its applicable office (with a copy to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent’s Office) a Letter of Credit Application therefor, completed to the satisfaction of such Issuing Lender, and such other certificates, documents and other Letter of Credit Documents and information as such Issuing Lender or the Administrative Agent may request, not later than 11:00 a.m. (Portland time) at least three (3) Business Days (or such later date and time as the Administrative Agent and such Issuing Lender may agree in their sole discretion) prior to the proposed date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension, as the case may be.

Upon receipt of any Letter of Credit Application, the applicable Issuing Lender shall, process such Letter of Credit Application and the certificates, documents and other Letter of Credit Documents and information delivered to it in connection therewith in accordance with its customary procedures and shall, subject to Section 2.1B(a) and Article V, promptly issue, amend, renew or extend the Letter of Credit requested thereby (subject to the timing requirements set forth in this Section 2.1B(b)) by issuing the original of such Letter of Credit to the beneficiary thereof or as otherwise may be agreed by such Issuing Lender and the Borrower.  Additionally, the Borrower shall furnish to the applicable Issuing Lender and the Administrative Agent such other documents and information pertaining to such requested Letter of Credit issuance or amendment, renewal or extension, including any Letter of Credit Documents, as such Issuing Lender or the Administrative Agent may require.  The applicable Issuing Lender shall promptly furnish to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent a copy of such Letter of Credit and the related Letter of Credit Documents and the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the issuance and upon request by any Lender, furnish to such Lender a copy of such Letter of Credit and the amount of such Lender’s participation therein.(c)Commissions and Other Charges.  (i)Letter of Credit Commissions.  Subject to Section 3.7, with respect to any outstanding Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the applicable Issuing Lender and the applicable L/C Participants, a letter of credit commission in the amount equal to the daily amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit times the LIBOR Margin then in effect (determined on a per annum basis).  Such commission in respect of any Letter of Credit shall be payable quarterly in arears on the fifteenth (15th) Business Day following each fiscal quarter of Borrower.

Such issuance, fronting and documentation fees shall be payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each calendar quarter commencing with the first such date to occur after the issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the Maturity Date and thereafter on demand of the applicable Issuing Lender. 34(iii)Other Fees, Costs, Charges and Expenses.  In addition to the foregoing fees and commissions, the Borrower shall pay or reimburse each Issuing Lender for such normal and customary fees, costs, charges and expenses as are incurred or charged by such Issuing Lender in issuing, effecting payment under, amending or otherwise administering any Letter of Credit issued by it.  Such customary fees, costs, charges and expenses are due and payable on demand and are nonrefundable.(d)L/C Participations.  (i)Each Issuing Lender irrevocably agrees to grant and hereby grants to each L/C Participant, and, to induce each Issuing Lender to issue Letters of Credit hereunder, each L/C Participant irrevocably agrees to accept and purchase and hereby accepts and purchases from each Issuing Lender, on the terms and conditions hereinafter stated, for such L/C Participant’s own account and risk an undivided interest equal to such L/C Participant’s Commitment Percentage in each Issuing Lender’s obligations and rights under and in respect of each Letter of Credit issued by it hereunder and the amount of each draft paid by each Issuing Lender thereunder.  Each L/C Participant unconditionally and irrevocably agrees with each Issuing Lender that, if a draft is paid under any Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender for which such Issuing Lender is not reimbursed in full by the Borrower through a Revolving Loan or otherwise in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, such L/C Participant shall pay to such Issuing Lender upon demand at such Issuing Lender’s address for notices specified herein an amount equal to such L/C Participant’s Commitment Percentage of the amount of such draft, or any part thereof, which is not so reimbursed.(ii)Upon becoming aware of any amount required to be paid by any L/C Participant to any Issuing Lender pursuant to Section 2.1B(d)(i) in respect of any unreimbursed portion of any payment made by such Issuing Lender under any Letter of Credit issued by it, the applicable Issuing Lender shall notify the Administrative Agent of such unreimbursed amount and the Administrative Agent shall notify each L/C Participant (with a copy to the applicable Issuing Lender) of the amount and due date of such required payment and such L/C Participant shall pay to the Administrative Agent (which, in turn shall pay the applicable Issuing Lender) the amount specified on the applicable due date.  If any such amount is paid to the applicable Issuing Lender after the date such payment is due, such L/C Participant shall pay to the Administrative Agent, which in turn shall pay the applicable Issuing Lender on demand, in addition to such amount, the product of (A) such amount, times (B) the daily average NYFRB Rate as determined by the Administrative Agent during the period from and including the date such payment is due to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the applicable Issuing Lender, times (C) a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days that elapse during such period and the denominator of which is 360, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the applicable Issuing Lender in connection with the foregoing.  A certificate of an Issuing Lender with respect to any amounts owing to it under this Section shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.  With respect to payment to an Issuing Lender of the unreimbursed amounts described in this Section, if the L/C Participants receive notice that any such payment is due (x) prior to 1:00 p.m. on any Business Day, such payment shall be due that Business Day, and (y) after 1:00 p.m. on any Business Day, such payment shall be due on the following Business Day.(iii)Whenever, at any time after any Issuing Lender has made payment under any Letter of Credit issued by it and has received from any L/C Participant its Commitment Percentage of such payment in accordance with this Section, such Issuing Lender receives any payment related to such Letter of Credit (whether directly from the Administrative Agent or otherwise), or any payment of interest on account thereof, such Issuing Lender will distribute to such L/C Participant its pro rata share thereof; provided, that in the event that any such payment 35received by such Issuing Lender shall be required to be returned by such Issuing Lender, such L/C Participant shall return to the Administrative Agent, which shall in turn pay to such Issuing Lender, the portion thereof previously distributed by such Issuing Lender to it.(iv)Each L/C Participant’s obligation to make the payments referred to in Section 2.1B(d)(ii) and to purchase participating interests pursuant to Section 2.1B(d)(i) shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right that such Lender or the Borrower may have against the applicable Issuing Lender, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default or an Event of Default or the failure to satisfy any of the other conditions specified in Article V, (C) any adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise) of the Borrower, (D) any breach of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other Lender or (E) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing.(e)Reimbursement.  In the event of any drawing under any Letter of Credit, the Borrower agrees to reimburse (either with the proceeds of a Revolving Loan as provided for in this Section or with funds from other sources), in same day funds, the applicable Issuing Lender by paying to the Administrative Agent the amount of such drawing not later than 12:00 noon on (i) the Business Day that the Borrower receives notice of such drawing, if such notice is received by the Borrower prior to 10:00 a.m., or (ii) the Business Day immediately following the day that the Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is not received prior to such time, for the amount of (x) such draft so paid and (y) any amounts referred to in Section 2.1B(c)(iii) incurred by the applicable Issuing Lender in connection with such payment.  Unless the Borrower shall immediately notify the Administrative Agent and the applicable Issuing Lender that the Borrower intends to reimburse such Issuing Lender for such drawing from other sources or funds, the Borrower shall be deemed to have timely given a Notice of Borrowing to the Administrative Agent requesting that the Lenders make a Revolving Loan as a Base Rate Loan on the applicable repayment date in the amount (without regard to the minimum and multiples specified in Section 2.1A) of (i) such draft so paid and (ii) any amounts referred to in Section 2.1B(c)(iii) incurred by the applicable Issuing Lender in connection with such payment, and the Lenders shall make a Revolving Loan as a Base Rate Loan in such amount, the proceeds of which shall be applied to reimburse such Issuing Lender for the amount of the related drawing and such fees and expenses.  Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to fund a Revolving Loan in accordance with this Section to reimburse an Issuing Lender for any draft paid under a Letter of Credit issued by it is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including non-satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 2.1A or Article V.  If the Borrower has elected to pay the amount of such drawing with funds from other sources and shall fail to reimburse the applicable Issuing Lender as provided above, or if the amount of such drawing is not fully refunded through a Base Rate Loan as provided above, the unreimbursed amount of such drawing shall bear interest at the rate which would be payable on any outstanding Base Rate Loans which were then overdue from the date such amounts become payable (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) until paid in full.(f)Obligations Absolute.  (i)The Borrower’s obligations under this Section 2.1B (including the Reimbursement Obligations) shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable under any and all circumstances whatsoever, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and irrespective of:36(A)    any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit, any Letter of Credit Document or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein or herein;(B)    the existence of any claim, counterclaim, setoff, defense or other right that the Borrower may have or have had against any Issuing Lender or any beneficiary of a Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), any Lender or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or by such Letter of Credit or any agreement or instrument relating thereto, or any unrelated transaction; (C)    the validity or genuineness of documents or of any endorsements thereon, even though such documents shall in fact prove to be invalid, fraudulent, forged or insufficient in any respect or any statement in such draft or other document being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; or any error in translation or loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under such Letter of Credit; (D)    any payment by an Issuing Lender under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; or(E)    any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the Borrower’s obligations hereunder.(ii)The Borrower also agrees that the Issuing Lenders and the L/C Participants shall not be responsible for, and the Borrower’s Reimbursement Obligations under Section 2.1B(e) shall not be affected by, among other things, the validity or genuineness of documents or of any endorsements thereon, even though such documents shall in fact prove to be invalid, fraudulent or forged, or any dispute between or among the Borrower and any beneficiary of any Letter of Credit or any other party to which such Letter of Credit may be transferred or any claims whatsoever of the Borrower against any beneficiary of such Letter of Credit or any such transferee.  The Issuing Lenders, the L/C Participants and their respective Related Parties shall not have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit, or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in translation or error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the applicable Issuing Lender; provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse any Issuing Lender from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by such Issuing Lender’s failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit issued by it comply with the terms thereof.  The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of an Issuing Lender (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), such Issuing Lender shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination.  37(iii)In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that (A) with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the applicable Issuing Lender may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit, (B) an Issuing Lender may act upon any instruction or request relative to a Letter of Credit or requested Letter of Credit that such Issuing Lender in good faith believes to have been given by a Person authorized to give such instruction or request and (C) an Issuing Lender may replace a purportedly lost, stolen, or destroyed original Letter of Credit or missing amendment thereto with a certified true copy marked as such or waive a requirement for its presentation, subject to receipt by such Issuing Lender of any customary indemnities or other agreements by the Borrower in connection therewith.  The responsibility of an Issuing Lender to the Borrower in connection with any draft presented for payment under any Letter of Credit issued by it shall, in addition to any payment obligation expressly provided for in such Letter of Credit, be limited to determining that the documents (including each draft) delivered under such Letter of Credit in connection with such presentment substantially conforms to the requirements under such Letter of Credit.(g)Effect of Letter of Credit Documents.  To the extent that any provision of any Letter of Credit Document related to any Letter of Credit is inconsistent with the provisions of this Section 2.1B, the provisions of this Section 2.1B shall apply.(h)Resignation of Issuing Lenders.(i)Any Issuing Lender may resign at any time by giving 30 days’ prior notice to the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Borrower.  After the resignation of an Issuing Lender hereunder, the retiring Issuing Lender shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Lender under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents with respect to outstanding Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such resignation, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit or to extend, renew or increase the outstanding Letter of Credit. (ii)Any resigning Issuing Lender shall retain all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of an Issuing Lender hereunder with respect to all Letters of Credit issued by it that are outstanding as of the effective date of its resignation as an Issuing Lender and all L/C Obligations with respect thereto (including the right to require the Lenders to take such actions as are required under Section 2.1B(d).  Without limiting the foregoing, upon the resignation of a Lender as an Issuing Lender hereunder, the Borrower may, or at the request of such resigned Issuing Lender the Borrower shall, use commercially reasonable efforts to, arrange for one or more of the other Issuing Lenders to issue Letters of Credit hereunder in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, issued by such resigned Issuing Lender and outstanding at the time of such resignation, or make other arrangements satisfactory to the resigned Issuing Lender to effectively cause another Issuing Lender to assume the obligations of the resigned Issuing Lender with respect to any such Letters of Credit.(i)Reporting of Letter of Credit Information and L/C Commitment.  At any time that there is an Issuing Lender that is not also the Person acting as Administrative Agent, then (i) no later than the fifth Business Day following the last day of each calendar month, (ii) on each date that a Letter of Credit is amended, terminated or otherwise expires, (iii) on each date that a Letter of Credit is issued or the expiry date of a Letter of Credit is extended, and (iv) upon the request of the Administrative Agent, each such Issuing Lender shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a report setting forth in form and detail reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent information (including any reimbursement, Cash 38Collateral, or termination in respect of Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender) with respect to each Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender that is outstanding hereunder.  In addition, each Issuing Lender shall provide notice to the Administrative Agent of its L/C Commitment, or any change thereto, promptly upon it becoming an Issuing Lender or making any change to its L/C Commitment.  No failure on the part of an Issuing Lender to provide such information pursuant to this Section 2.1B(i) shall limit the obligations of the Borrower or any Lender hereunder with respect to its reimbursement and participation obligations hereunder.(j)Letter of Credit Amounts.(i)Unless otherwise specified, all references herein to the amount of a Letter of Credit at any time shall be deemed to mean the maximum face amount of such Letter of Credit after giving effect to all increases thereof contemplated by such Letter of Credit or the Letter of Credit Documents therefor (at the time specified therefor in such applicable Letter of Credit or Letter of Credit Documents and as such amount may be reduced by (i) any permanent reduction of such Letter of Credit or (ii) any amount which is drawn, reimbursed and no longer available under such Letter of Credit).(ii)For all purposes of this Agreement, if on any date of determination a Letter of Credit has expired by its terms but any amount may still be drawn thereunder by reason of the operation of Article 29(a) of the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits, International Chamber of Commerce Publication No. 600 (or such later version thereof as may be in effect at the applicable time) or Rule 3.13 or Rule 3.14 of the International Standby Practices, International Chamber of Commerce Publication No. 590 (or such later version thereof as may be in effect at the applicable time) or similar terms of the Letter of Credit itself, or if compliant documents have been presented but not yet honored, such Letter of Credit shall be deemed to be “outstanding” and “undrawn” in the amount so remaining available to be paid, and the obligations of the Borrower and each Lender shall remain in full force and effect until the Issuing Lenders and the Lenders shall have no further obligations to make any payments or disbursements under any circumstances with respect to any Letter of Credit. 2.2    SWING LOANS(a)    In lieu of making Revolving Loans, the Swing Line Lender, in its sole discretion, on the terms and subject to the conditions contained in this Agreement, may make loans to Borrower from time to time until the Maturity Date as provided herein in an aggregate amount not to exceed at any time outstanding the Swing Loan Sublimit; provided, that, after giving effect to any Swing Loan, (i) the Revolving Credit Outstandings shall not exceed the aggregate Revolving Loan Commitments and (ii) the Revolving Credit Exposure of any Lender (including the Lender acting as Swing Line Lender) shall not at any time exceed such Lender’s Revolving Loan Commitment.  To request a Swing Loan, Borrower shall submit a written notice to the Administrative Agent by telecopy or electronic mail not later than 10:00 AM (Portland time) on the date of a proposed Swing Loan.  Each such notice shall be in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by an Authorized Representative, shall be irrevocable and shall specify the requested date (which shall be a Business Day) and amount of the requested Swing Loan.  The Administrative Agent will promptly advise the Swing Line Lender of any such notice received from Borrower.  The Swing Line Lender shall make each Swing Loan available to Borrower by means of a credit to an account of Borrower designated in such notice promptly on the requested date of such Swing Loan.  All Swing Loans shall be Base Rate Loans and may, at Swing Line Lender’s option, be evidenced by a promissory note.  Borrower shall repay the outstanding principal balance of each Swing Loan, together with all accrued and unpaid interest and related fees thereon, on the earlier of (x) the seventh (7) Business Day after such Swing Loan is made and (y) the Maturity Date; provided that, on each date that a Revolving Loan is made, Borrower shall repay all Swing Loans then outstanding and the proceeds of any 39such Revolving Loan shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to repay any Swing Loans outstanding.  All interest due on the Swing Loans shall be payable to the Swing Line Lender.(b)    Borrower may, so long as no Default is continuing at such time, request the conversion of any Swing Loan to a Base Rate Loan by giving Administrative Agent irrevocable written notice (in a form approved by the Administrative Agent) signed by an Authorized Representative, that specifies, among other things: (i) the Swing Loan to which such notice of conversion applies; (ii) the principal amount that is the subject of such conversion; and (iii) the proposed date of such conversion, which shall be a Business Day. Any such notice must be received by Administrative Agent not later than 9:00 AM (Portland time) on the required date of repayment of the applicable Swing Loan; provided that no notice of conversion may be provided on the Maturity Date.  Administrative Agent shall promptly notify Swing Line Lender and each Lender of the contents of each such notice and each Lender’s Commitment Percentage of the proposed Base Rate Loan.  Each Lender shall, before 11:00 a.m. (Portland time) on such Business Day, make available to Administrative Agent, in immediately available funds, the amount of its Commitment Percentage of such principal amount of such converted Swing Loan.(c)    At any time, upon the request of the Swing Line Lender to Administrative Agent that some or all of the Swing Loans be converted to Revolving Loans, Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the principal amount of Swing Loans which Swing Line Lender desires to be converted and each Lender’s Commitment Percentage thereof.  Each Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees, promptly upon receipt of such notice from the Administrative Agent (and in any event, if such notice is received by (x) 12:00 noon (Portland time) on a Business Day, no later than 2:00 PM (Portland time) on such Business Day, and (y) after 12:00 noon (Portland time) on a Business Day, no later than 7:00 AM (Portland time) time on the immediately succeeding Business Day), to make available to Administrative Agent, in immediately available funds, the amount of its Commitment Percentage of such principal amount of such Swing Loans.  Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to fund its Commitment Percentage of any Loans pursuant to this paragraph is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Revolving Loan Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.(d)    Upon any payment by a Lender pursuant to Section 2.2(b) or (c), such Lender shall be deemed to have made a Revolving Loan as a Base Rate Loan to Borrower, notwithstanding any failure by Borrower to satisfy the conditions contained in Section 5.2 (without regard to the minimum amount of Base Rate Loans).  Administrative Agent shall use such funds to repay the principal amount of Swing Loans to the Swing Line Lender.  With respect to the Swing Loans, after receipt of payment of principal or interest thereon, Administrative Agent will promptly distribute the same to the Swing Line Lender at its Applicable Lending Office.2.3    INTEREST/FEES(a)    Interest. The outstanding principal balance of each Loan shall bear interest at the Applicable Rate.  The foregoing notwithstanding, the rate of interest applicable at all times during the continuation of an Event of Default shall be a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the Applicable Rate plus 200 basis points.  All fees, expenses and other amounts not paid when due shall bear interest (from the date due until paid) at the highest rate described in the preceding sentence.  In no contingency or event whatsoever shall the aggregate of all amounts deemed interest under this Agreement charged or collected pursuant to the terms of this Agreement exceed the highest rate permissible under any Governmental Rule which a court of competent jurisdiction shall, in a final determination, deem applicable hereto.  In the event that such a court determines that the Lenders have charged or received interest hereunder in excess of the highest applicable rate, the rate in effect hereunder shall automatically be reduced to the maximum rate permitted by Governmental Rule and the Lenders shall at Administrative Agent’s option (i) promptly refund to the Borrower any interest received by the Lenders in excess of the maximum lawful rate or 40(ii) apply such excess to the principal balance of the Obligations.  It is the intent hereof that the Borrower not pay or contract to pay, and that neither Administrative Agent nor any Lender receive or contract to receive, directly or indirectly in any manner whatsoever, interest in excess of that which may be paid by the Borrower under applicable law.(b)    Commitment Fees. Commencing on the Closing Date, Borrower shall pay to Administrative Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Lenders, a commitment fee equal to the Fee Percentage on the average daily unused portion of the Revolving Loan Commitments of the Lenders (other than the Defaulting Lenders, if any); provided, that the amount of outstanding Swing Loans shall not be considered usage of the Revolving Loan Commitments for the purpose of calculating the Commitment Fee.  The Commitment Fee shall be payable in arrears on the last Business Day of each calendar quarter during the term of this Agreement and ending on the date upon which all Obligations (other than (1) contingent indemnification obligations not then due and (2) Guaranteed Cash Management Obligations or Guaranteed Hedge Obligations as to which arrangements satisfactory to the applicable holders thereof shall have been made) shall have been indefeasibly and irrevocably paid and satisfied in full, the Revolving Loan Commitments have been terminated and all Letters of Credit have been terminated or have expired (or have been Cash Collateralized).  The Commitment Fee shall be distributed by Administrative Agent to the Lenders (other than any Defaulting Lender) pro rata in accordance with such Lenders’ respective Commitment Percentages.(c)    Computation and Payment. All interest and per annum fees shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year, except that interest computed by reference to the Base Rate at times when the Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).  Interest on Base Rate Loans and LIBOR Daily Loans shall be payable monthly, in arrears, on the first day of each month and on the Maturity Date.  Interest on each LIBOR Loan shall be paid on (i) the last day of its Interest Period, (ii) at the end of the third month of its Interest Period (if such period is six months in duration), (iii) on the date of any payment of principal made before the end of its Interest Period and (iv) on the Maturity Date.2.4    INTEREST OPTIONS(a)    Election. With respect to the Revolving Loans, Borrower may (i) except as otherwise provided herein, at any time when a Default is not continuing, convert all or any portion of a Base Rate Loan or a LIBOR Daily Loan to a LIBOR Loan for an Interest Period designated by Borrower, (ii) at any time, convert all or any portion of a Base Rate Loan to a LIBOR Daily Loan or convert all or any portion of a LIBOR Daily Loan to a Base Rate Loan, and (iii) convert all or a portion of a LIBOR Loan at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto to a Base Rate Loan, a LIBOR Daily Loan or, if no Default is continuing, to a LIBOR Loan for a new Interest Period designated by Borrower, provided that if Borrower has not made the required interest rate conversion or continuation election prior to the last day of any Interest Period, Borrower shall be deemed to have elected to convert such LIBOR Loan to a LIBOR Loan having an Interest Period of one month.  Each LIBOR Loan elected pursuant to this Section 2.4(a) must be in a minimum amount of $500,000 and in integral multiples of $100,000 and at no time shall there be more than ten (10) different Interest Periods outstanding with respect to LIBOR Loans elected pursuant to this Section 2.4(a).41(b)    Notice to Administrative Agent. Borrower shall request each interest rate conversion or continuation under Section 2.4(a) by giving Administrative Agent irrevocable written notice in the form of Exhibit C attached hereto (a “Notice of Conversion or Continuation”) and signed by an Authorized Representative, that specifies, among other things: (i) the Loan to which such Notice of Conversion or Continuation applies; (ii) the principal amount that is the subject of such conversion or continuation; (iii) the proposed date of such conversion or continuation, which shall be a Business Day; and (iv) if such Notice pertains to a LIBOR Loan, the length of the applicable Interest Period. Any such Notice of Conversion or Continuation must be received by Administrative Agent not later than (i) 9:00 AM (Portland time) on the Business Day of any Base Rate or LIBOR Daily Rate interest selection, and (ii) 10:00 AM (Portland time) at least three (3) Business Days prior to the effective date of any LIBOR interest selection. Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the contents of each such Notice of Conversion or Continuation, or if timely notice is not received from Borrower prior to the last day of any Interest Period, of the automatic conversion of such LIBOR Loan to a LIBOR Loan having an Interest Period of one month.(c)    Subject to Section 9.3, (i) immediately upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default under Section 9.1(a) or (h), or (ii) at the election of the Required Lenders (or the Administrative Agent at the direction of the Required Lenders), upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any other Event of Default, (A) the Borrower shall no longer have the option to request LIBOR Loans, Swing Loans or Letters of Credit, (B) all outstanding LIBOR Loans shall bear interest at a rate per annum of two percent (2%) in excess of the rate (including the Applicable Margin) then applicable to LIBOR Loans until the end of the applicable Interest Period and thereafter at a rate equal to two percent (2%) in excess of the rate (including the Applicable Margin) then applicable to Base Rate Loans, (C) all outstanding Base Rate Loans, LIBOR Daily Loans and other Obligations arising hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to two percent (2%) in excess of the rate (including the Applicable Margin) then applicable to Base Rate Loans (in the case of Loans) or such other Obligations arising hereunder or under any other Loan Document and (D) all accrued and unpaid interest shall be due and payable on demand of the Administrative Agent.  Interest shall continue to accrue on the Obligations after the filing by or against the Borrower of any petition seeking any relief in bankruptcy or under any Debtor Relief Law.2.5    PAYMENTS GENERALLY(a)    Administrative Agent may, and Borrower hereby authorizes Administrative Agent to, debit any deposit account of Borrower with Administrative Agent for all payments of principal, interest, fees and other amounts due under the Loan Documents as they become due.(b)    All payments to be made by Borrower shall be made without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by Borrower hereunder shall be made to Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the applicable Administrative Agent’s Office in same day funds not later than 11:00 AM, Portland time, on the date specified herein. All payments received by Administrative Agent after 11:00 AM, Portland time, may, at the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue.(c)    Subject to the definition of “Interest Period,” if any payment to be made by Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day.42(d)    Subject to Section 9.4 (which provisions shall apply at any time an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing), if at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied in the following order: (i) first, toward indemnities, costs and expenses incurred by Administrative Agent and each Lender ratably among the parties entitled thereto, (ii) second, toward repayment of interest and fees then due hereunder with respect to the Revolving Loans, Swing Loans and Letters of Credit, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, (iv) third, toward repayment of principal then due hereunder with respect to the Revolving Loans and Swing Loans and payment of any unreimbursed amounts in respect of Letters of Credit, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal then due to such parties.(e)    Unless Borrower or any Lender has notified Administrative Agent prior to the date any payment is required to be made by it to Administrative Agent hereunder, that Borrower or such Lender, as the case may be, will not make such payment, Administrative Agent may assume that Borrower or such Lender, as the case may be, has timely made such payment and may (but shall not be so required to), in reliance thereon, make available a corresponding amount to the Person entitled thereto. If and to the extent that such payment was not in fact made to Administrative Agent in same day funds, then:(i)    if Borrower failed to make such payment, each Lender shall forthwith on demand repay to Administrative Agent the portion of such assumed payment that was made available to such Lender in same day funds, together with interest thereon in respect of each day from and including the date such amount was made available by Administrative Agent to such Lender to the date such amount is repaid to Administrative Agent in same day funds, at the applicable NYFRB Rate from time to time in effect; and(ii)    if any Lender failed to make such payment, such Lender shall forthwith on demand pay to Administrative Agent the amount thereof in same day funds, together with interest thereon for the period from the date such amount was made available by Administrative Agent to Borrower to the date such amount is recovered by Administrative Agent (the “Compensation Period”) at a rate per annum equal to the applicable NYFRB Rate from time to time in effect. If such Lender pays such amount to Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender’s Loan included in the applicable borrowing. Nothing herein shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill its Commitment or to prejudice any rights which Administrative Agent or Borrower may have against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder.A notice of Administrative Agent to any Lender with respect to any amount owing under this subsection (e) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.(f)    If any Lender makes available to Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in this Article II, and the applicable conditions in Article V are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, Administrative Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest.(g)    The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Loans are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan.(h)    Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner.432.6    FUNDING(a)    Lender Funding and Disbursement. Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein, each Lender shall, by 11:00 AM (Portland time) on the date of each borrowing make available to Administrative Agent at Administrative Agent’s Office, in same day or immediately available funds, such Lender’s Commitment Percentage thereof. After Administrative Agent’s receipt of such funds and upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in Article V, Administrative Agent will promptly disburse such funds in same day or immediately available funds to Borrower. Unless otherwise directed by Borrower in writing, Administrative Agent shall disburse the proceeds of each borrowing to Borrower by deposit to any demand deposit account maintained by Borrower with Administrative Agent designated by Borrower in a notice to Administrative Agent.(b)    Lender Failure to Fund. Unless Administrative Agent receives notice from a Lender on or before the date of any borrowing hereunder that such Lender will not make available to Administrative Agent such Lender’s Commitment Percentage thereof, Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such portion available to Administrative Agent on the date of such borrowing in accordance with Section 2.6(a), and Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to Borrower (or otherwise disburse) on such date a corresponding amount. If any Lender does not make the amount of its Commitment Percentage of any borrowing available to Administrative Agent on the date of such borrowing, such Lender shall pay to Administrative Agent, on demand, interest which shall accrue on such amount until made available to Administrative Agent at a rate equal to the daily NYFRB Rate. A certificate of Administrative Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this Section shall be presumptive evidence of such amounts. If any Lender’s Commitment Percentage of any borrowing is not in fact made available to Administrative Agent by such Lender within three Business Days after the date of such borrowing, Borrower shall pay to Administrative Agent, on demand, an amount equal to such Commitment Percentage together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount was made available to Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to Administrative Agent, at the rate of interest specified in Section 2.3.(c)    Lenders’ Obligations Several. The obligation of each Lender hereunder is several. The failure of any Lender to make available its Commitment Percentage of any borrowing shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation hereunder to do so on the date requested, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make available the Commitment Percentage to be funded by such other Lender.2.7    PRO RATA TREATMENT(a)    Borrowings. Except as otherwise provided herein, each Loan, except a Swing Loan, shall be made by or shared by each Lender in accordance with its Commitment Percentage.(b)    Sharing of Payments, Etc. Except as otherwise provided herein, each payment of principal, interest or fees owing to the Lenders shall be made or shared among Lenders ratably.  If any Lender obtains any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of setoff or otherwise) on account of a Loan in excess of its Commitment Percentage of payments on the Loans obtained by all Lenders, such Lender (“Purchasing Lender”) shall forthwith purchase from the other Lenders sufficient participations to cause the Purchasing Lender’s interest in the Loans to be in the same proportionate relationship with all Loans as before such payment was received; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from the Purchasing Lender, the purchased participation shall be rescinded and each other Lender shall repay to the Purchasing Lender (i) the purchase price to the extent of such recovery together with (ii) an amount equal to such other Lender’s ratable share (according to the proportion of (A) the amount of such other Lender’s required repayment to (B) the total amount so recovered from the Purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the Purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered. Borrower agrees that any 44Purchasing Lender may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of setoff) with respect to such participation as fully as if the Purchasing Lender were the direct creditor of Borrower in the amount of such participation and, provided further, the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to (x) any fees not payable to all Lenders generally or any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender), (y) the application of Cash Collateral provided for in Section 3.10 or (z) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of, or sale of, a participation in any of its Loans or participations in Swing Loans and Letters of Credit to any assignee or participant.2.8    STATEMENTS AND MANNER OF PAYMENT(a)From time to time, Administrative Agent may render to Borrower a statement setting forth the balance in the loan account(s) maintained by Administrative Agent for Borrower pursuant to this Agreement, including principal, interest, fees, costs and expenses, and it is Administrative Agent’s present intention to do so once a month. Each such statement shall be subject to subsequent adjustment by Administrative Agent but shall, absent manifest errors or omissions, be considered correct and deemed accepted by Borrower and conclusively binding upon Borrower as an account stated except to the extent that Administrative Agent receives notice from Borrower of any specific exceptions thereto within sixty days after the date such statement has been mailed by Administrative Agent. Until such time as Administrative Agent shall have rendered to Borrower a written statement as provided above, the balance in the loan account(s) shall be presumptive evidence of the amounts due and owing to Lenders by Borrower(b)Each payment by the Borrower on account of the principal of or interest on the Loans or of any fee, commission or other amounts (including the Reimbursement Obligations) payable to the Lenders under this Agreement shall be made not later than 1:00 p.m. on the date specified for payment under this Agreement to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent’s Office for the account of the Lenders entitled to such payment in U.S. Dollars, in immediately available funds and shall be made without any setoff, counterclaim or deduction whatsoever.  Any payment received after such time but before 2:00 p.m. on such day shall be deemed a payment on such date for the purposes of Section 9.1, but for all other purposes shall be deemed to have been made on the next succeeding Business Day.  Any payment received after 2:00 p.m. shall be deemed to have been made on the next succeeding Business Day for all purposes.  Upon receipt by the Administrative Agent of each such payment, the Administrative Agent shall distribute to each such Lender at its address for notices set forth herein its Commitment Percentage (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment and shall wire advice of the amount of such credit to each Lender.  Each payment to the Administrative Agent on account of the principal of or interest on the Swing Loans or of any fee, commission or other amounts payable to the Swing Line Lender shall be made in like manner, but for the account of the Swing Line Lender.  Each payment to the Administrative Agent of the Issuing Lenders’ fees or L/C Participants’ commissions shall be made in like manner, but for the account of the applicable Issuing Lenders or the applicable L/C Participants, as the case may be.  Each payment to the Administrative Agent of Administrative Agent’s fees or expenses shall be made for the account of the Administrative Agent and any amount payable to any Lender under Sections 3.1, 3.4, 3.5, 11.2 or 11.3 shall be paid to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Lender.  Subject to the definition of Interest Period, if any payment under this Agreement shall be specified to be made upon a day which is not a Business Day, it shall be made on the next succeeding day which is a Business Day and such extension of time shall in such case be included in computing any interest if payable along with such payment.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if there exists a Defaulting Lender each payment by the Borrower to such Defaulting Lender hereunder shall be applied in accordance with Section 3.7(b)(ii).452.9    AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVESOn the Closing Date, and from time to time subsequent thereto at Borrower’s option, Borrower shall deliver to Administrative Agent a notice in substantially the form of Exhibit D attached hereto (or such other form as agreed by the Administrative Agent), which designates by name each of Borrower’s Authorized Representatives or amends or amends and restates all prior such notices and includes the respective specimen signatures of each additional Authorized Representative (each such notice, amendment to a previous notice or amended and restated notice, a “Notice of Authorized Representatives”). Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely conclusively on the authority of each officer or employee designated as an Authorized Representative in the most current Notice of Authorized Representatives delivered by Borrower to Administrative Agent, to request borrowings, to select interest rate options hereunder, and to give to Administrative Agent such other notices as are specified herein as being made through one of Borrower’s Authorized Representatives, until such time as Borrower has delivered to Administrative Agent, and Administrative Agent has actual receipt of, a new Notice of Authorized Representatives. Administrative Agent shall have no duty or obligation to Borrower to verify the authenticity of any signature appearing on any Notice of Borrowing, Notice of Conversion or Continuation or any other notice from an Authorized Representative or to verify the authenticity of any person purporting to be an Authorized Representative giving any telephonic notice permitted hereby.ARTICLE IIITAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY3.1    TAXES(a)For purposes of this Section 3.1, the term “applicable law” includes FATCA.(b)Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable law.  If any applicable law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable Withholding Agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a Withholding Agent, then the applicable Withholding Agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that, after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section), the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made.(c)The Loan Parties shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law, or at the option of Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes.(d)The Borrower shall indemnify each Recipient, within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Recipient (with a copy to Administrative Agent), or by Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Recipient, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.46(e)Each Lender shall severally indemnify Administrative Agent, within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that the Borrower has not already indemnified Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 11.7(d) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  Each Lender hereby authorizes Administrative Agent to setoff and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to Administrative Agent under this paragraph (e). (f)As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by any Loan Party to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section 3.1, such Loan Party shall deliver to Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to Administrative Agent.(g)Status of Lenders.(i)Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding.  In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 3.1(g)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.(ii)Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that the Borrower is a U.S. Person:(A)any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or Administrative Agent), executed copies of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from United States federal backup withholding tax;(B)any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:47(1)in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, United States federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “interest” article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, United States federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “business profits” or “other income” article of such tax treaty;(2)executed copies of IRS Form W-8ECI;(3)in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a “10 percent shareholder” of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a “controlled foreign corporation” described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a “U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate”) and (y) executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN-E; or(4)to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed copies of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN-E, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-2 or Exhibit H-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner;(C)any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or Administrative Agent), executed copies of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in United States federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower or Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and(D)if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to United States federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.  Solely 48for purposes of this clause (D), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.(h)If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 3.1 (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section 3.1), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund).  Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph (h) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (h), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph (h) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid.  This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.(i)Survival.  Each party’s obligations under this Section 3.1 shall survive the resignation or replacement of Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Revolving Loan Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document.3.2    ILLEGALITYUnless and until a Benchmark Rate is implemented in accordance with Section 3.8, if any Lender determines that any Governmental Rule has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its Applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund LIBOR Loans or LIBOR Daily Loans, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon Base LIBOR, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take, U.S. Dollar deposits in the London interbank market, in each case after the date hereof, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to Borrower through Administrative Agent, any obligation of such Lender to make or continue LIBOR Loans or LIBOR Daily Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans to LIBOR Loans or LIBOR Daily Loans shall be suspended until such Lender notifies Administrative Agent and Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Promptly upon making any such determination, such Lender shall provide notice thereof to Borrower (with a copy to Administrative Agent), and upon receipt of such notice, Borrower shall, within three (3) Business Days of receipt of written notice from such Lender, prepay or convert all such LIBOR Loans and LIBOR Daily Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans, either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor (in the case of LIBOR Loans), if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such LIBOR Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Loan is a LIBOR Daily Loan or such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such LIBOR Loans, as the case may be. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, Borrower shall also pay interest on the amount so prepaid or converted. Each Lender agrees to designate a different Applicable Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for such notice 49and will not, in the good faith judgment of such Lender, otherwise be materially disadvantageous to such Lender.3.3    INABILITY TO DETERMINE RATES    Unless and until a Benchmark Rate is implemented in accordance with Section 3.8 below, if Administrative Agent determines in connection with any request for a LIBOR Loan or a LIBOR Daily Loan or a conversion to or continuation of a LIBOR Loan or LIBOR Daily Loan that (a) U.S. Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in the London interbank market for the applicable amount of such Loan and, in the case of LIBOR Loans, the Interest Period of such LIBOR Loan, (b) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining Base LIBOR for such Loan (provided that no Benchmark Transition Event shall have occurred at such time), or (c) Base LIBOR for such Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the Lenders of funding or maintaining such Loan, then, in each case, Administrative Agent will promptly so notify Borrower and all Lenders. Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain LIBOR Loans or LIBOR Daily Loans, as the case may be, shall be suspended until Administrative Agent notifies Borrower and all Lenders that it has revoked such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, Borrower may revoke any pending request for a LIBOR Loan or LIBOR Daily Loan, as applicable, or a conversion or continuation of LIBOR Loans or LIBOR Daily Loans, as applicable, or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Base Rate Loan in the amount specified therein.3.4    INCREASED COSTS(a)If any Change in Law shall:(i)impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or advances, loans or other credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement reflected in the LIBOR Rate or the LIBOR Daily Rate);(ii)subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; or(iii)impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense (other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or LIBOR Loans or LIBOR Daily Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender, such Issuing Lender or such other Recipient of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan), or to increase the cost to such Lender, such Issuing Lender or such other Recipient of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of Credit), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender, such Issuing Lender or such other Recipient hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon written request of such Lender, such Issuing Lender or other Recipient, the Borrower shall promptly pay to any such Lender, such Issuing Lender or other Recipient, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender, such Issuing Lender or other Recipient, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.50(b)If any Lender or Issuing Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or such Issuing Lender or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender’s or such Issuing Lender’s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s or such Issuing Lender’s capital or on the capital of such Lender’s or such Issuing Lender’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Revolving Loan Commitment of such Lender or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit or Swing Loans held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or such Issuing Lender or such Lender’s or such Issuing Lender’s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s or such Issuing Lender’s policies and the policies of such Lender’s or such Issuing Lender’s holding company with respect to capital adequacy and liquidity), then from time to time upon written request of such Lender or such Issuing Lender the Borrower shall promptly pay to such Lender or such Issuing Lender, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuing Lender or such Lender’s or such Issuing Lender’s holding company for any such reduction suffered.  It is acknowledged that this Agreement is being entered into by the Lenders on the understanding that the Lenders will not be required to maintain capital against their Revolving Loan Commitment under current applicable laws, regulations and regulatory guidelines.  In the event the Lenders shall be advised by any Governmental Authority or shall otherwise determine on the basis of pronouncements of any Governmental Authority that such understanding is incorrect, it is agreed that the Lenders will be entitled to make claims under this Section (each such claim to be made within a reasonable period of time after the period to which it relates) based upon market requirements prevailing on the date hereof for commitments under comparable credit facilities against which capital is required to be maintained.(c)A certificate of a Lender or such other Recipient setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender, such other Recipient or any of their respective holding companies, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section and delivered to the Borrower, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  The Borrower shall pay such Lender or such other Recipient, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within ten (10) days after receipt thereof.(d)Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or such other Recipient to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s or such other Recipient’s right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate any Lender or any other Recipient pursuant to this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine (9) months prior to the date that such Lender or such other Recipient, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions, and of such Lender’s or such other Recipient’s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).(e)All of the obligations of the Loan Parties under this Section 3.4 shall survive the resignation or replacement of Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Revolving Loan Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document.3.5    INDEMNITY FOR FUNDING LOSSESExcept as otherwise provided in this Agreement, following receipt by Borrower from any Lender of a certificate of such Lender in accordance with the last paragraph in this Section 3.5, Borrower, on demand, shall compensate such Lender for, and hold such Lender harmless from, any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of:51(a)any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any LIBOR Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise); or(b)any failure by Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any LIBOR Loan on the date or in the amount notified by Borrower,(c)including any loss of anticipated profits and any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such LIBOR Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained, as determined by Administrative Agent in its sole discretion.  Borrower shall also pay any customary administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing. For purposes of calculating amounts payable by Borrower to the Lenders under this Section 3.5, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each LIBOR Loan made by it at LIBOR for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the London interbank market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such LIBOR Loan was in fact so funded.(d)The amount of any loss, cost or expense compensable by Borrower to any Lender pursuant to this Section 3.5 shall be determined by such Lender, who shall notify Borrower (with a copy to Administrative Agent) in the form of a certificate of such Lender stating that the calculations set forth therein are in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for such calculations, such certificate being conclusive and binding for all purposes absent manifest error. The amount set forth in such certificate shall be payable by Borrower on the thirtieth (30th) day following delivery of such certificate to Borrower. In determining such amount, Administrative Agent or such Lender may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods.3.6    SURVIVALAll of Borrower’s obligations under this Article III shall survive termination of the Revolving Loan Commitments and repayment of all Obligations.3.7    DEFAULTING LENDERS(a)If (i) a Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, or a Lender (a “Non-Consenting Lender”) refuses to consent to an amendment, restatement, modification or waiver of this Credit Agreement that, pursuant to Section 11.4, requires consent of 100% of the Lenders or 100% of the Lenders with Obligations directly affected, or a Lender imposes charges, costs and expenses unacceptable to Borrower under Section 3.4 (any such Defaulting Lender, Non-Consenting Lender or other Lender, a “Subject Lender”), (ii) no Default shall have occurred and be continuing, (iii) Borrower has obtained a commitment from another Lender or an Eligible Assignee (as defined in Section 11.7(h)), to purchase at par the Subject Lender’s Loans and assume the Subject Lender’s Revolving Loan Commitment and all other obligations of the Subject Lender hereunder, and (iv) any such Lender or Eligible Assignee is approved by Administrative Agent, each Issuing Lender and Swing Line Lender, each such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, then Borrower may require the Subject Lender to assign any or all of its Loans and Revolving Loan Commitment and other obligations to such other Lender, Lenders, Eligible Assignee or Eligible Assignees pursuant to the provisions of Section 11.7; provided, that, prior to or concurrently with such replacement, (A) the Subject Lender shall have received payment in full of all principal, interest, fees and other amounts owing to such Subject Lender through such date of replacement in respect of the applicable portion of the Subject Lender’s Revolving Loan Commitment to be assigned and a release from its obligations (relating to the assigned portion) under the Loan Documents, (B) the processing fee, if any, required to be paid under Section 11.7 shall have been paid to the Administrative Agent, (C) all of the requirements for such assignment contained in Section 11.7, including the consent of the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Lender and the Swing Line Lender, and, subject to the final sentence of this paragraph, the receipt by the Administrative Agent of an executed Assignment and 52Assumption and other supporting documents, have been fulfilled, and (D) if such Subject Lender is a Non-Consenting Lender, each assignee shall consent, at the time of such assignment, to each matter in respect of which such Subject Lender was a Non-Consenting Lender and Borrower also requires each other Subject Lender that is a Non-Consenting Lender to assign its Loans and Revolving Loan Commitments.  Each party hereto agrees that (x) an assignment required pursuant to this paragraph may be effected pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption executed by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the assignee (or, to the extent applicable, an agreement incorporating an Assignment and Assumption by reference pursuant to an electronic platform approved by Administrative Agent as to which Administrative Agent and such parties are participants), and (y) the Lender required to make such assignment need not be a party thereto in order for such assignment to be effective and shall be deemed to have consented to and be bound by the terms thereof; provided that, following the effectiveness of any such assignment, the other parties to such assignment agree to execute and deliver such documents necessary to evidence such assignment as reasonably requested by the applicable Lender; provided further that any such documents shall be without recourse to or warranty by the parties thereto.(b)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as such Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable law:(i)Such Defaulting Lender’s right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in the definition of “Required Lenders” and in Section 11.4.(ii)Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Article IX or otherwise) or received by Administrative Agent from a Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 11.8 shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by Administrative Agent as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to Administrative Agent hereunder; second, to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to any Issuing Lender or the Swing Line Lender hereunder; third, to Cash Collateralize the Fronting Exposure of each Issuing Lender and the Swing Line Lender with respect to such Defaulting Lender in accordance with Section 3.10; fourth, as the Borrower may request (so long as no Default or Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Loan or funded participation in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by Administrative Agent; fifth, if so determined by Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to be held in a deposit account and released pro rata in order to (A) satisfy such Defaulting Lender’s potential future funding obligations with respect to Loans and funded participations under this Agreement and (B) Cash Collateralize the Issuing Lenders’ future Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender with respect to future Letters of Credit issued under this Agreement, in accordance with Section 3.10; sixth, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders, any Issuing Lender or the Swing Line Lender as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender, any Issuing Lender or the Swing Line Lender against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; seventh, so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and eighth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if (1) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans or funded participations in Letters of Credit or Swing Loans in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share, and (2) such Loans were made or the related Letters of Credit or Swing Loans were issued at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 5.2 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely 53to pay the Loans of, and funded participations in Letters of Credit or Swing Loans owed to, all Non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of, or funded participations in Letters of Credit or Swing Loans owed to, such Defaulting Lender until such time as all Loans and funded and unfunded participations in L/C Obligations and Swing Loans are held by the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the Revolving Loan Commitments without giving effect to Section 3.7(b)(iv). Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section 3.7(b)(ii) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.(iii)Certain Fees.(A)No Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive any Commitment Fee for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and the Borrower shall not be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender).(B)Each Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive Letter of Credit commissions pursuant to Section 2.1B(c) for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender only to the extent allocable to its Commitment Percentage of the stated amount of Letters of Credit for which it has provided Cash Collateral pursuant to Section 3.10.(C)With respect to any Commitment Fee or Letter of Credit commission not required to be paid to any Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (A) or (B) above, the Borrower shall (1) pay to each Non-Defaulting Lender that portion of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender with respect to such Defaulting Lender’s participation in L/C Obligations or Swing Loans that has been reallocated to such Non-Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (iv) below, (2) pay to each Issuing Lender and the Swing Line Lender the amount of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender to the extent allocable to each Issuing Lender’s and Swing Line Lender’s Fronting Exposure to such Defaulting Lender, and (3) not be required to pay the remaining amount of any such fee.(iv)Reallocation of Participations to Reduce Fronting Exposure.  All or any part of such Defaulting Lender’s participation in L/C Obligations and Swing Loans shall be reallocated among the Non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitment Percentages (calculated without regard to such Defaulting Lender’s Revolving Loan Commitment) but only to the extent that such reallocation does not cause the aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure of any Non-Defaulting Lender to exceed such Non-Defaulting Lender’s Revolving Loan Commitment.  Subject to Section 11.22, no reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a Non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such Non-Defaulting Lender’s increased exposure following such reallocation.(v)Cash Collateral, Repayment of Swing Loans.  If the reallocation described in clause (iv) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrower shall, without prejudice to any right or remedy available to it hereunder or under law, (x) first, repay Swing Loans in an amount equal to the Swing Line Lender’s Fronting Exposure and (y) second, Cash Collateralize each Issuing Lender’s Fronting Exposure.54(c)If the Borrower, Administrative Agent, each Issuing Lender and the Swing Line Lender agree in writing that a Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any Cash Collateral), such Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Loans to be held pro rata by the Lenders in accordance with the Revolving Loan Commitments (without giving effect to Section 3.7(b)(iv)), whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Non-Defaulting Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender’s having been a Defaulting Lender.3.8    CHANGED CIRCUMSTANCES(a)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document (and any Hedge Agreement shall be deemed not to be a “Loan Document” for purposes of this Section 3.8), if a Benchmark Transition Event or an Early Opt-in Election, as applicable, and its related Benchmark Replacement Date have occurred prior to the Reference Time in respect of any setting of the then-current Benchmark, then (x) if a Benchmark Replacement is determined in accordance with clause (1) or (2) of the definition of “Benchmark Replacement” for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of such Benchmark setting and subsequent Benchmark settings without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document and (y) if a Benchmark Replacement is determined in accordance with clause (3) of the definition of “Benchmark Replacement” for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of any Benchmark setting at or after 5:00 p.m. on the fifth (5th) Business Day after the date notice of such Benchmark Replacement is provided to the Lenders without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document so long as the Administrative Agent has not received, by such time, written notice of objection to such Benchmark Replacement from Lenders comprising the Required Lenders.(b)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document and subject to the proviso below in this paragraph, if a Term SOFR Transition Event and its related Benchmark Replacement Date have occurred prior to the Reference Time in respect of any setting of the then-current Benchmark, then the applicable Benchmark Replacement will replace the then-current Benchmark for all purposes hereunder or under any Loan Document in respect of such Benchmark setting and subsequent Benchmark settings, without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document; provided that, this clause (c) shall not be effective unless the Administrative Agent has delivered to the Lenders and the Borrower a Term SOFR Notice.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent shall not be required to deliver a Term SOFR Notice after a Term SOFR Transition Event and may do so in its sole discretion.55(c)In connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement, the Administrative Agent will have the right to make Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document.(d)The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of (i) any occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event, a Term SOFR Transition Event or an Early Opt-in Election, as applicable, and its related Benchmark Replacement Date, (ii) the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement, (iii) the effectiveness of any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes, (iv) the removal or reinstatement of any tenor of a Benchmark pursuant to clause (e) below and (v) the commencement or conclusion of any Benchmark Unavailability Period. Any determination, decision or election that may be made by the Administrative Agent or, if applicable, any Lender (or group of Lenders) pursuant to this Section 3.8, including any determination with respect to a tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action or any selection, will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error and may be made in its or their sole discretion and without consent from any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document, except, in each case, as expressly required pursuant to this Section 3.8.(e)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, at any time (including in connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement), (i) if the then-current Benchmark is a term rate (including Term SOFR or Base LIBOR) and either (A) any tenor for such Benchmark is not displayed on a screen or other information service that publishes such rate from time to time as selected by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion or (B) the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark has provided a public statement or publication of information announcing that any tenor for such Benchmark is or will be no longer representative, then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of “Interest Period” for any Benchmark settings at or after such time to remove such unavailable or non-representative tenor and (ii) if a tenor that was removed pursuant to clause (i) above either (A) is subsequently displayed on a screen or information service for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement) or (B) is not, or is no longer, subject to an announcement that it is or will no longer be representative for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement), then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of “Interest Period” for all Benchmark settings at or after such time to reinstate such previously removed tenor.(f)Upon the Borrower’s receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period, the Borrower may revoke any request for a LIBOR Loan or LIBOR Daily Loan or any conversion to or continuation of LIBOR Loans or LIBOR Daily Loans during any Benchmark Unavailability Period and, failing that, the Borrower will be deemed to have converted any such request for a LIBOR Loan or LIBOR Daily Loan into a request for a Base Rate Loan.  During any Benchmark Unavailability Period or at any time that a tenor for the then-current Benchmark is not an Available Tenor, the component of Base Rate based upon the then-current Benchmark or such tenor for such Benchmark, as applicable, will not be used in any determination of Base Rate.3.9    INCREMENTAL INCREASES.(a)At any time after the Closing Date, upon written notice to Administrative Agent, the Borrower may, from time to time, request one or more increases in the Revolving Loan Commitments (each, an “Incremental Commitment Increase”) or enter into one or more tranches of term loans (each an “Incremental Term Loan”; any Incremental Commitment Increase or Incremental Term Loan being referred to as an “Incremental Increase”); provided that (A) the aggregate initial principal amount of all Incremental Increases hereunder shall not exceed the Incremental Facilities Limit, (B) any such Incremental Increase shall be in a minimum amount of $5,000,000 (or such lesser amount as agreed to by 56Administrative Agent) or, if less, the remaining amount of the Incremental Facilities Limit, (C) no Lender will be required otherwise obligated to provide any portion of such Incremental Increase and (D) no more than five (5) Incremental Increases shall be permitted to be requested during the term of this Agreement.(b)Each notice from the Borrower pursuant to this Section 3.9 shall set forth the requested amount and proposed terms of the relevant Incremental Increase.  Incremental Increases may be provided by any existing Lender or by any other Eligible Assignee (each such Lender or other Person, an “Incremental Lender”); provided that Administrative Agent and, in the case of any Incremental Commitment Increase, each Issuing Lender and the Swing Line Lender, shall have consented (in each case not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) to such Incremental Lender’s providing such Incremental Increases to the extent any such consent would be required under Section 11.7 for an assignment of Loans or Revolving Loan Commitments, as applicable, to such Incremental Lender.  At the time of sending such notice, the Borrower (in consultation with Administrative Agent) shall specify the time period within which each proposed Incremental Lender is requested to respond, which shall in no event be less than ten (10) Business Days from the date of delivery of such notice to the proposed Incremental Lenders (or such shorter period as agreed to by Administrative Agent).  Each proposed Incremental Lender may elect or decline, in its sole discretion, and shall notify Administrative Agent within such time period whether it agrees, to provide an Incremental Increase and, if so, whether by an amount equal to, greater than or less than requested.  Any Person not responding within such time period shall be deemed to have declined to provide an Incremental Increase.(c)Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall determine the effective date (the “Increase Effective Date”) and the final allocation of such Incremental Increase (limited in the case of the Incremental Lenders to their own respective allocations thereof).  Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Incremental Lenders of the final allocation of such Incremental Increases and the Increase Effective Date.(d)The terms of each Incremental Increase (which shall be set forth in the relevant Incremental Amendment) shall be determined by the Borrower and the applicable Incremental Lenders; provided that:(i)each such Incremental Commitment Increase shall have the same terms, including maturity, Applicable Rate and Commitment Fees, as applicable to the Revolving Loan Commitments; provided that (x) any upfront fees payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under any Incremental Commitment Increases may differ from those payable under the then existing Revolving Loan Commitments and (y) the Applicable Rate or Commitment Fees or interest rate floor applicable to any Incremental Commitment Increase may be higher than the Applicable Rate or Commitment Fees or interest rate floor applicable to the Revolving Loan Commitments if the Applicable Rate or Commitment Fees or interest rate floor applicable to the Revolving Loan Commitments are increased to equal the Applicable Rate and Commitment Fees and interest rate floor applicable to such Incremental Increase; and(ii)the Incremental Term Loans (A) shall not mature earlier than the Maturity Date (but may have market level amortization prior to such date), (B) to the extent any Incremental Term Loans have been provided hereunder prior to such date, shall have a Weighted Average Life to Maturity no shorter than that applicable to the previously provided Incremental Term Loans and (C) shall be treated substantially the same as (and in any event no more favorably than) the Revolving Loans and any other Incremental Term Loans provided hereunder prior to such date; provided that (x) the terms and conditions applicable to any tranche of Incremental Term Loans maturing after the Maturity Date may provide for material additional or different financial or other covenants or prepayment requirements applicable only during periods after the Maturity Date and (y) the Incremental Term Loans may be priced differently than the Applicable 57Rate or interest rate floor applicable to the Revolving Loans or any other Incremental Term Loans provided hereunder prior to such date; and (iii)each Incremental Increase shall constitute Obligations of the Borrower and will be guaranteed by the Guarantors and secured on a pari passu basis with the other Obligations.(e)Any Incremental Increase shall become effective as of such Increase Effective Date and shall be subject to the following conditions precedent:(i)no Default or Event of Default shall exist on such Increase Effective Date immediately prior to or after giving effect to (A) such Incremental Increase or (B) the making of the initial advances pursuant thereto;(ii)all of the representations and warranties set forth in Article IV shall be true and correct in all material respects (or if qualified by materiality or Material Adverse Effect, in all respects) as of such Increase Effective Date, or if such representation speaks as of an earlier date, as of such earlier date;(iii)Administrative Agent shall have received from the Borrower, a Compliance Certificate demonstrating that the Borrower is in compliance with the financial covenants set forth in Article VIII, both before and after giving effect on a pro forma basis to the incurrence of any such Incremental Increase (and assuming that any such Incremental Increase is fully drawn and calculated without netting any cash proceeds of such Incremental Increase or any other Indebtedness being funded on such date in connection therewith) and any Permitted Acquisition, refinancing of Indebtedness or other event consummated in connection therewith giving rise to a pro forma basis adjustment; (iv)the Loan Parties shall have executed an Incremental Amendment in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Borrower, Administrative Agent and the applicable Incremental Lenders; and(v)Administrative Agent shall have received from the Borrower, any customary legal opinions or other documents (including a resolution duly adopted by the board of directors (or equivalent governing body) of each Loan Party authorizing such Incremental Increase), reasonably requested by Administrative Agent in connection with such Incremental Increase.(f)Each such Incremental Increase shall be effected pursuant to an amendment (an “Incremental Amendment”) to this Agreement and, as appropriate, the other Loan Documents, executed by the Loan Parties, Administrative Agent and the applicable Incremental Lenders, which Incremental Amendment may, without the consent of any other Lenders, effect such amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the reasonable opinion of Administrative Agent, to effect the provisions of this Section 3.9.(g)The proceeds of any Incremental Increase may be used by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including the financing of Permitted Acquisitions and other Investments permitted hereunder and any other use not prohibited by this Agreement.(h)In connection with any Incremental Increase, any Incremental Lender becoming a party hereto shall (i) execute such documents and agreements as Administrative Agent may reasonably request and (2) provide to Administrative Agent, its name, address, tax identification number and/or such other information as shall be necessary for Administrative Agent to comply with “know your customer” and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including without limitation, the Patriot Act. 583.10    CASH COLLATERAL(a)At any time that there shall exist a Defaulting Lender, within one Business Day following the written request of Administrative Agent, any Issuing Lender or the Swing Line Lender (with a copy to Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall either repay, in full, the outstanding principal balance of the Swing Loans or Cash Collateralize the Fronting Exposure of such Issuing Lender and/or the Swing Line Lender, as applicable, with respect to such Defaulting Lender (determined after giving effect to Section 3.7 and any Cash Collateral provided by such Defaulting Lender) in an amount not less than the Minimum Collateral Amount.(b)The Borrower, and to the extent provided by any Defaulting Lender, such Defaulting Lender, hereby grants to Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Issuing Lenders and the Swing Line Lender, and agrees to maintain, a first priority security interest in all such Cash Collateral as security for the Defaulting Lender’s obligation to fund participations in respect of L/C Obligations and Swing Loans, to be applied pursuant to subsection (b) below.  If at any time Administrative Agent determines that Cash Collateral is subject to any right or claim of any Person other than Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lenders and the Swing Line Lender as herein provided, or that the total amount of such Cash Collateral is less than the Minimum Collateral Amount, the Borrower will, promptly upon demand by Administrative Agent, pay or provide to Administrative Agent additional Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to eliminate such deficiency (after giving effect to any Cash Collateral provided by the Defaulting Lender).(c)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or any other Loan Document, Cash Collateral provided under this Section 3.10 in respect of Swing Loans and Letters of Credit shall be applied to the satisfaction of the Defaulting Lender’s obligation to fund participations in respect of L/C Obligations and Swing Loans (including, as to Cash Collateral provided by a Defaulting Lender, any interest accrued on such obligation) for which the Cash Collateral was so provided, prior to any other application of such property as may otherwise be provided for herein.(d)Cash Collateral (or the appropriate portion thereof) provided to reduce the Fronting Exposure of any Issuing Lender and/or the Swing Line Lender, as applicable, shall no longer be required to be held as Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section 3.10 following (i) the elimination of the applicable Fronting Exposure (including by the termination of Defaulting Lender status of the applicable Lender), or (ii) the determination by Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lenders and the Swing Line Lender that there exists excess Cash Collateral; provided that, subject to Section 3.7, the Person providing Cash Collateral, the Issuing Lenders and the Swing Line Lender may agree that Cash Collateral shall be held to support future anticipated Fronting Exposure or other obligations; provided further that to the extent that such Cash Collateral was provided by the Borrower, such Cash Collateral shall remain subject to the security interest granted pursuant to the Loan Documents.3.11    ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT’S CLAWBACK.(a)Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent.  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender (i) in the case of Base Rate Loans or LIBOR Daily Loans, not later than 12:00 noon on the date of any proposed borrowing and (ii) otherwise, prior to the proposed date of any borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender’s share of such borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available in accordance with this Agreement and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount.  In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the daily average NYFRB Rate and a rate determined 59by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans.  If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period.  If such Lender pays its share of the applicable borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender’s Loan included in such borrowing.  Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.(b)Payments by the Borrower; Presumptions by Administrative Agent.  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders, any Issuing Lender or the Swing Line Lender hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders, the applicable Issuing Lender or the Swing Line Lender, as the case may be, the amount due.  In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders, each Issuing Lender or the Swing Line Lender, as the case maybe, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender, such Issuing Lender or the Swing Line Lender, with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the NYFRB Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.(c)Nature of Obligations of Lenders.  The obligations of the Lenders under this Agreement to make the Loans, to issue or participate in Letters of Credit and to make payments under this Section, Section 5.11(e), Section 12.3(c) or Section 12.7, as applicable, are several and are not joint or joint and several.  The failure of any Lender to make available its Commitment Percentage of any Loan requested by the Borrower shall not relieve it or any other Lender of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Commitment Percentage of such Loan available on the borrowing date, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make its Commitment Percentage of such Loan available on the borrowing date.ARTICLE IVREPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIESBorrower makes the following representations and warranties to Administrative Agent and Lenders, subject to the exceptions set forth on the Disclosure Schedule, which representations and warranties shall survive the execution of this Agreement and shall continue in full force and effect until the performance and indefeasible payment in full, in cash, of all Obligations (other than (1) contingent indemnification obligations not then due and (2) Guaranteed Cash Management Obligations or Guaranteed Hedge Obligations as to which arrangements satisfactory to the applicable holders thereof shall have been made), the Revolving Loan Commitments have been terminated and all Letters of Credit have been terminated or have expired (or have been Cash Collateralized):604.1    LEGAL STATUS; SUBSIDIARIESBorrower and each Subsidiary is duly organized and validly existing in good standing (to the extent such concept is applicable) under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing (to the extent such concept is applicable) as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where the nature of its business requires such qualification, and has full power and authority and holds all Permits and other approvals necessary to own and hold under lease its property and to conduct its business substantially as currently conducted by it, except where the failure to be so organized and existing, have so qualified, or have such power, authority or Permit could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

No course of dealing between the Borrower, Administrative Agent and the Lenders or their respective agents 80or employees shall be effective to change, modify or discharge any provision of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or to constitute a waiver of any Default or Event of Default.(b)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any other Loan Document, the authority to enforce rights and remedies hereunder and under the other Loan Documents against the Loan Parties or any of them shall be vested exclusively in, and all actions and proceedings at law in connection with such enforcement shall be instituted and maintained exclusively by, Administrative Agent in accordance with Section 9.2 for the benefit of all the Lenders; provided that the foregoing shall not prohibit (a) Administrative Agent from exercising on its own behalf the rights and remedies that inure to its benefit (solely in its capacity as Administrative Agent) hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, (b) Swing Line Lender from exercising the rights and remedies that inure to its benefit (solely in its capacity as the Swing Line Lender, as the case may be) hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, (c) any Lender from exercising setoff rights in accordance with Section 11.8 (subject to the terms of Section 2.7(b)), or (d) any Lender from filing proofs of claim or appearing and filing pleadings on its own behalf during the pendency of a proceeding relative to any Loan Party under any Debtor Relief Law; provided, further, that if at any time there is no Person acting as Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, then (i) the Required Lenders shall have the rights otherwise ascribed to Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 9.2 and (ii) in addition to the matters set forth in clauses (b), (c) and (d) of the preceding proviso and subject to Section 2.7(b), any Lender may, with the consent of the Required Lenders, enforce any rights and remedies available to it and as authorized by the Required Lenders.9.4    CREDITING OF PAYMENTS AND PROCEEDS.In the event that the Obligations have been accelerated pursuant to Section 9.2 or Administrative Agent or any Lender has exercised any remedy set forth in this Agreement or any other Loan Document, all payments received on account of the Obligations and all net proceeds from the enforcement of the Obligations shall, subject to the provisions of Sections 3.7 and 3.10, be applied by Administrative Agent as follows:First, to payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting fees, indemnities, expenses and other amounts, including attorney fees, payable to Administrative Agent in its capacity as such;Second, to payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting fees (other than Commitment Fees), indemnities and other amounts (other than principal and interest) payable to the Lenders and the Swing Line Lender under the Loan Documents, including attorneys’ fees, ratably among the Lenders and the Swing Line Lender in proportion to the respective amounts described in this clause Second payable to them;Third, to payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting accrued and unpaid Commitment Fees and interest on the Loans and Reimbursement Obligations, ratably among the Lenders in proportion to the respective amounts described in this clause Third payable to them;Fourth, to payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting unpaid principal of the Loans and Reimbursement Obligations, and Guaranteed Hedge Obligations and Guaranteed Cash Management Obligations then owing and to Cash Collateralize any L/C Obligations then outstanding, ratably among the applicable Holders of Obligations in proportion to the respective amounts described in this clause Fourth payable to them; and81Last, the balance, if any, after all of the Obligations have been paid in full, to the Borrower or as otherwise required by Governmental Rule.Notwithstanding the foregoing, Guaranteed Cash Management Obligations and Guaranteed Hedge Obligations shall be excluded from the application described above if Administrative Agent has not received written notice thereof, together with such supporting documentation as Administrative Agent may request, from the applicable holders thereof following such acceleration or exercise of remedies and at least three (3) Business Days prior to the application of the proceeds thereof.  Each holder of Guaranteed Hedge Obligations or Guaranteed Hedge Obligations not a party to this Agreement that has given the notice contemplated by the preceding sentence shall, by such notice, be deemed to have acknowledged and accepted the appointment of Administrative Agent pursuant to the terms hereof for itself and its Affiliates as if a “Lender” party hereto.9.5    ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT MAY FILE PROOFS OF CLAIM.In case of the pendency of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or any other judicial proceeding relative to any Loan Party, Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan or other Obligations shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on any Loan Party) shall be entitled and empowered (but not obligated) by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise:(a)to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans and all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders and Administrative Agent (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders and Administrative Agent and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders  and Administrative Agent under this Agreement) allowed in such judicial proceeding; and(b)to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender to make such payments to Administrative Agent and, in the event that Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders, to pay to Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due Administrative Agent under this Agreement.ARTICLE XADMINISTRATIVE AGENT10.1    APPOINTMENT AND AUTHORITY(a)Each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably appoints JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to act on its behalf as Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and authorizes Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to Administrative Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.  The provisions of this Article are solely for the benefit of Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary thereof shall have rights as a third-party beneficiary of any of such provisions.  It is understood and agreed that the use of the term “agent” herein or in any other Loan Documents (or any other similar term) with reference to Administrative Agent 82is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any Governmental Rule. Instead such term is used as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting parties.(b)Administrative Agent shall also act as the “collateral agent” under the Loan Documents, and each of the Holders of Obligations hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes Administrative Agent to act as the agent of such Lender for purposes of acquiring, holding and enforcing any and all Liens on Cash Collateral granted by any of the Loan Parties to secure any of the Obligations, together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto (including to enter into additional Loan Documents or supplements to existing Loan Documents on behalf of the Holders of Obligations).  In this connection, Administrative Agent, as “collateral agent” and any co-agents, sub-agents and attorneys-in-fact appointed by Administrative Agent pursuant to this Article X for purposes of holding or enforcing any Lien on the Cash Collateral (or any portion thereof) granted hereunder, or for exercising any rights and remedies thereunder at the direction of Administrative Agent), shall be entitled to the benefits of all provisions of Articles X and XI (including Section 11.3, as though such co-agents, sub-agents and attorneys-in-fact were the “collateral agent” under the Loan Documents) as if set forth in full herein with respect thereto.10.2    RIGHTS AS A LENDERThe Person serving as Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not Administrative Agent and the term “Lender” or “Lenders” shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity.  Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, own securities of, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not Administrative Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.10.3    EXCULPATORY PROVISIONS(a)Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, and its duties hereunder and thereunder shall be administrative in nature.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Administrative Agent:(i)shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing;(ii)shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that Administrative Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents), provided that Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose Administrative Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or Governmental Rule, including for the avoidance of doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any Debtor Relief Law or that may affect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any Debtor Relief Law; and(iii)shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.83(b)Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Section 11.2 and Section 9.2) or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final non-appealable judgment.  Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default or Event of Default unless and until written notice describing such Default or Event of Default and indicating that such written notice is a “Notice of Default” is given to Administrative Agent by the Borrower or a Lender.(c)Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article V or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to Administrative Agent.10.4    RELIANCE BY ADMINISTRATIVE AGENTAdministrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person.  Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon.  In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, or the issuance, extension, renewal or increase of a Letter of Credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or an Issuing Lender, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender or such Issuing Lender unless Administrative Agent shall have received written notice to the contrary from such Lender or such Issuing Lender prior to the making of such Loan or the issuance of such Letter of Credit.  Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.10.5    DELEGATION OF DUTIESAdministrative Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by Administrative Agent.  Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties.  The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities hereunder, as well as activities as Administrative Agent.  Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any sub-agents except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and non-appealable judgment that Administrative Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such subagents.8410.6    RESIGNATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT(a)Administrative Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders and the Borrower.  Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the Borrower and subject to the consent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of the Borrower (provided no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of such resignation), to appoint a successor, which shall be a bank or financial institution reasonably experienced in serving as administrative agent on syndicated bank facilities with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such bank or financial institution with an office in the United States.  If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the “Resignation Effective Date”), then the retiring Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to), on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above.  Whether or not a successor has been appointed, such resignation shall become effective in accordance with such notice on the Resignation Effective Date.(b)If the Person serving as Administrative Agent is a Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (d) of the definition thereof, the Required Lenders may, to the extent permitted by Governmental Rule, by notice in writing to the Borrower and such Person, remove such Person as Administrative Agent and, in consultation with the Borrower, appoint a successor. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the “Removal Effective Date”), then such removal shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice on the Removal Effective Date.(c)With effect from the Resignation Effective Date or the Removal Effective Date (as applicable), (i) the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (except that in the case of any collateral security held by Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders under any of the Loan Documents, the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall continue to hold such collateral security until such time as a successor Administrative Agent is appointed) and (ii) except for any indemnity payments owed to the retiring or removed Administrative Agent, all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender directly, until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided for above.  Upon the acceptance of a successor’s appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring or removed Administrative Agent (other than any rights to indemnity payments owed to the retiring or removed Administrative Agent), and the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents.  The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor.  After the retiring or removed Administrative Agent’s resignation or removal hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article and Section 11.3 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring or removed Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring or removed Administrative Agent was acting as Administrative Agent or relating to its duties as Administrative Agent that are carried out following its retirement or removal.(d)Any resignation by, or removal of, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section shall also constitute its resignation as Swing Line Lender and Issuing Lender.  Upon the acceptance of a successor’s appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, (i) such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties, if in its sole discretion it elects to, of an Issuing Lender and Swing Line Lender, (ii) the retiring Issuing Lender and Swing Line Lender shall be discharged from all of their respective duties and obligations hereunder or 85under the other Loan Documents, and (iii) the successor Issuing Lender, if in its sole discretion it elects to, shall issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession or make other arrangements satisfactory to the retiring Issuing Lender to effectively assume the obligations of the retiring Issuing Lender with respect to such Letters of Credit.10.7    NON-RELIANCE ON ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND OTHER LENDERSEach Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement.  Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.10.8    NO OTHER DUTIES, ETC.Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none of the syndication agents, documentation agents, co-agents, arrangers or bookrunners listed on the cover page hereof shall have any powers, duties or responsibilities under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, except in its capacity, as applicable, as Administrative Agent or a Lender hereunder.10.9    GUARANTY MATTERS(a)Each of the Lenders (including in its or any of its Affiliate’s capacities as a Holder of Obligations) irrevocably authorize Administrative Agent, at its option and in its discretion, to release any Guarantor from its obligations under any Loan Documents if such Person ceases to be a Subsidiary as a result of a transaction permitted under the Loan Documents, as certified by the Borrower.  Further, Administrative Agent may (and is hereby irrevocably authorized by each Lender to), upon the request of Borrower, release any Guarantor from its obligations under its Guaranty if such Guarantor is no longer a Material Subsidiary.  Upon request by Administrative Agent at any time, the Required Lenders will confirm in writing Administrative Agent’s authority to release any Guarantor from its obligations under the Guaranty pursuant to this Section 10.9.  In each case as specified in this Section 10.9, Administrative Agent will, at the Borrower’s expense, execute and deliver to the applicable Loan Party such documents as such Loan Party may reasonably request to evidence the release of such Guarantor from its obligations under the Guaranty, in each case in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents and this Section 10.9 as certified by the Borrower.(b)At such time as all Obligations (other than (1) contingent indemnification obligations not then due and (2) Guaranteed Cash Management Obligations or Guaranteed Hedge Obligations as to which arrangements satisfactory to the applicable holders thereof shall have been made) arising hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall have been paid and satisfied in full in cash, all Letters of Credit have been terminated or expired (or Cash Collateralized) and the Revolving Loan Commitments have been terminated, each Guaranty and all obligations (other than those expressly stated to survive such termination) of each Guarantor thereunder shall automatically terminate, all without delivery of any instrument or performance of any act by any Person.(c)Any execution and delivery of documents pursuant to this Section shall be without recourse to or warranty by the Administrative Agent.8610.10    GUARANTEED HEDGE OBLIGATIONS AND GUARANTEED CASH MANAGEMENT OBLIGATIONSNo holder of any Guaranteed Hedge Obligations or Guaranteed Cash Management Obligations that obtains the benefits of Section 9.4 by virtue of the provisions hereof or of any Loan Document shall have any right to notice of any action or to consent to, direct or object to any action hereunder or under any other Loan Document other than in its capacity as a Lender and, in such case, only to the extent expressly provided in the Loan Documents.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article X to the contrary, Administrative Agent shall not be required to verify the payment of, or that other satisfactory arrangements have been made with respect to, Guaranteed Cash Management Obligations and Guaranteed Hedge Obligations unless Administrative Agent has received written notice of such Guaranteed Cash Management Obligations and Guaranteed Hedge Obligations, together with such supporting documentation as Administrative Agent may request, from the applicable holders thereof.10.11    POSTING OF COMMUNICATIONS(a)Borrower agrees that Administrative Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, make any Communications available to the Lenders and the Issuing Lenders by posting the Communications on IntraLinksTM, DebtDomain, SyndTrak, ClearPar or any other electronic platform chosen by the Administrative Agent to be its electronic transmission system (the “Approved Electronic Platform”).  As used herein, “Communications” means, collectively, any notice, demand, communication, information, document or other material provided by or on behalf of any Loan Party pursuant to any Loan Document or the transactions contemplated therein which is distributed by the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Lender by means of electronic communications pursuant to this Section, including through an Approved Electronic Platform.(b)Although the Approved Electronic Platform and its primary web portal are secured with generally-applicable security procedures and policies implemented or modified by Administrative Agent from time to time (including, as of the Closing Date, a user ID/password authorization system) and the Approved Electronic Platform is secured through a per-deal authorization method whereby each user may access the Approved Electronic Platform only on a deal-by-deal basis, each of the Lenders, the Issuing Lenders and Borrower acknowledges and agrees that the distribution of material through an electronic medium is not necessarily secure, that the Administrative Agent is not responsible for approving or vetting the representatives or contacts of any Lender that are added to the Approved Electronic Platform, and that there may be confidentiality and other risks associated with such distribution.  Each of the Lenders, the Issuing Lenders and Borrower hereby approves distribution of the Communications through the Approved Electronic Platform and understands and assumes the risks of such distribution.(c)THE APPROVED ELECTRONIC PLATFORM AND THE COMMUNICATIONS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE”.  THE APPLICABLE PARTIES (AS DEFINED BELOW) DO NOT WARRANT THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF THE COMMUNICATIONS, OR THE ADEQUACY OF THE APPROVED ELECTRONIC PLATFORM AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM LIABILITY FOR ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN THE APPROVED ELECTRONIC PLATFORM AND THE COMMUNICATIONS.  NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS OR FREEDOM FROM VIRUSES OR OTHER CODE DEFECTS, IS MADE BY THE APPLICABLE PARTIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMMUNICATIONS OR THE APPROVED ELECTRONIC PLATFORM.  IN NO EVENT SHALL THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, ANY ARRANGER OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE RELATED PARTIES (COLLECTIVELY, “APPLICABLE PARTIES”) HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO ANY LOAN PARTY, ANY LENDER, ANY ISSUING LENDER OR ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY FOR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING DIRECT OR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR 87CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, LOSSES OR EXPENSES (WHETHER IN TORT, CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF ANY LOAN PARTY’S OR THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT’S TRANSMISSION OF COMMUNICATIONS THROUGH THE INTERNET OR THE APPROVED ELECTRONIC PLATFORM.(d)Each Lender and Issuing Lender agrees that notice to it (as provided in the next sentence) specifying that Communications have been posted to the Approved Electronic Platform shall constitute effective delivery of the Communications to such Lender for purposes of the Loan Documents.

provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, claims, demands, 89actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements (including reasonable attorneys’ fees, whether incurred at the trial or appellate level, in an arbitration or administrative proceeding, in bankruptcy (including any adversary proceeding, contested matter or motion) or otherwise): (x) are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee;

or (z) result from a claim not involving an act or omission of Borrower and that is brought by an Indemnitee against another Indemnitee (other than against any Arranger or Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender or any Issuing Lender in their capacities as such); provided, further, that such indemnity shall not include the fees and costs of a separate lead counsel law firm and a local counsel law firm for any action brought in any state or federal court within the State of Oregon.

An Indemnitee may also require Borrower to defend the matter. Any failure or delay of an Indemnitee to notify Borrower of any suit, claim or demand shall not relieve Borrower of its obligations of this Section 11.3, but shall reduce such obligations to the extent of any increase in those obligations caused solely by an unreasonable failure or delay in providing such notice.(c)    To the extent that the Borrower for any reason fails to indefeasibly pay any amount required under clause (a) or (b) of this Section to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent (or any sub-agent thereof), any Issuing Lender, the Swing Line Lender or any Related Party of any of the foregoing, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent), such Issuing Lender, the Swing Line Lender or such Related Party, as the case may be, such Lender’s pro rata share (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought based on each Lender’s share of the Revolving Credit Outstandings at such time, or if the Revolving Credit Outstandings have been reduced to zero, then based on such Lender’s share of the Revolving Credit Outstandings immediately prior to such reduction) of such unpaid amount (including any such unpaid amount in respect of a claim asserted by such Lender); provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent), such Issuing Lender or the Swing Line Lender in its capacity as such, or against any Related Party of any of the foregoing acting for the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent), such Issuing Lender or the Swing Line Lender in connection with such capacity.  The obligations of the Lenders under this clause (c) are subject to the provisions of Section 3.7.(d)    To the fullest extent permitted by law, Borrower shall not assert, and hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for any Indemnified Liability for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, any Loan, or the use of the proceeds thereof.  No Indemnitee referred to in paragraph (a) above shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by unintended recipients of any information or other materials distributed by it through telecommunications, electronic or other information transmission systems in connection with this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 11.3(b) shall relieve the Borrower or any Loan 90Party of any obligation it may have to indemnify an Indemnitee, as provided in Section 11.3(a), against any special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages asserted against such Indemnitee by a third party.(e)    Each party’s obligations under this Section shall survive the termination of the Loan Documents and payment of the Obligations hereunder.11.4    WAIVERS, AMENDMENTS(a)    Any term, covenant, agreement or condition of any Loan Document may be amended, modified or waived if such amendment, modification or waiver is in writing and is signed by the Required Lenders (or by Administrative Agent with the written consent of the Required Lenders) and Borrower; provided, however, that any amendment, modification, waiver or consent which affects the rights or duties of Administrative Agent, any Issuing Lender or Swing Line Lender, in such capacity and not in the capacity as a Lender, must be in writing and be signed also by the affected Administrative Agent, such Issuing Lender or Swing Line Lender, as the case may be; provided further, that no such amendment, modification, waiver or consent shall:(i)    extend or increase the Revolving Loan Commitment of a Lender (or reinstate any Revolving Loan Commitment terminated pursuant to Section 2.1A(g) or 9.2) without the written consent of such Lender (it being understood and agreed that a waiver of any condition precedent in Section 5.2 or of any Default or a mandatory reduction in Revolving Loan Commitments is not considered an extension or increase in Revolving Loan Commitments by any Lender);(ii)    postpone any date fixed by this Agreement or any other Loan Document for any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts due to the Lenders (or any of them) or any scheduled reduction of the Revolving Loan Commitments hereunder or under any other Loan Document without the written consent of each Lender entitled to receive such payment or whose Revolving Loan Commitments are to be reduced;(iii)    reduce the principal of, or the rate of interest specified herein on, any Loan or Reimbursement Obligation, or (subject to clause (A) of the final proviso to this Section 11.4) any fees or other amounts payable hereunder or under any other Loan Document without the written consent of each Lender entitled to receive such amount; provided, however, that only the consent of the Required Lenders shall be necessary to (A) amend the definition of “Default Rate” or waive any obligation of any Borrower to pay interest at the Default Rate or (B) to amend any financial covenant hereunder (or any defined term used therein) even if the effect of such amendment would be to reduce the rate of interest on any Loan or L/C Obligation or to reduce any fee payable hereunder;(iv)    change Section 2.1A(g), Section 2.7 or Section 9.4 in a manner that would alter the ratable reduction of Revolving Loan Commitments or the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby;(v)    change any provision of this Section 11.4 or the definition of “Required Lenders” or any other provision hereof specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or modify any rights hereunder or make any determination or grant any consent hereunder (it being understood that, solely with the consent of the parties prescribed by Section 3.9(f) to be parties to an Incremental Amendment, Incremental Term Loans may be included in the determination of Required Lenders on substantially the same basis as the Revolving Loan Commitments and existing Loans are included on the Closing Date), without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby; 91(vi)    amend any guaranty of the Obligations (or release Borrower or any Guarantor of its obligations thereunder) (other than as authorized in Section 10.9 or as otherwise specifically permitted or contemplated in this Agreement or the applicable Guaranty) without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby; or(vii)    change the payment waterfall provisions of Section 2.5(d) or Section 9.4 without the written consent of each Lender;provided further, that (i) no amendment, modification, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by the applicable Issuing Lender in addition to the Lenders required above, affect the rights or duties of any Issuing Lender under this Agreement (including Section 10.9) or any Letter of Credit Documents relating to any Letter of Credit issued or to be issued by it; (ii) no amendment, modification, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by the Swing Line Lender in addition to the Lenders required above, affect the rights or duties of the Swing Line Lender under this Agreement; (iii) no amendment, modification, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by the Administrative Agent in addition to the Lenders required above, affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent under this Agreement or any other Loan Document or modify Section 11.23 hereof; (iv) any fee letter entered into by Borrower in connection with the credit facilities evidenced by this Agreement may be amended, or rights or privileges thereunder waived, in a writing executed only by the parties thereto; (v) each Letter of Credit Document may be amended, or rights or privileges thereunder waived, in a writing executed only by the parties thereto; provided that a copy of such amended Letter of Credit Document, cash collateral agreement or other document, as the case may be, shall be promptly delivered to the Administrative Agent upon such amendment or waiver; (vi) this Agreement may be amended, restated or modified as provided in the immediately following paragraph below; (vii) the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall be permitted to amend any provision of the Loan Documents (and such amendment shall become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to any Loan Document) if the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall have jointly identified an obvious error or any error, ambiguity, defect or inconsistency or omission of a technical or immaterial nature in any such provision; and (viii) the Administrative Agent may, without the consent of any Lender, enter into amendments or modifications to this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or to enter into additional Loan Documents as the Administrative Agent reasonably deems appropriate in order to implement any Benchmark Replacement or any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes or otherwise effectuate the terms of Section 3.8.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Defaulting Lender shall have any right to approve or disapprove any amendment, modification, waiver or consent hereunder, except that (A) the Revolving Loan Commitment of such Lender may not be increased or extended without the consent of such Lender, and (B) any amendment, waiver, modification or consent hereunder which requires the consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender that by its terms disproportionately and adversely affects any such Defaulting Lender relative to other affected Lenders shall require the consent of such Defaulting Lender.Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each Lender hereby irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent on its behalf, and without further consent of any Lender (but with the consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent), to (x) amend and restate this Agreement and the other Loan Documents if, upon giving effect to such amendment and restatement, such Lender shall no longer be a party to this Agreement (as so amended and restated), the Revolving Loan Commitment of such Lender shall have terminated, such Lender shall have no other commitment or other obligation hereunder and shall have been paid in full all principal, interest and other amounts owing to it or accrued for its account under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and (y) enter into amendments or modifications to this Agreement (including amendments to this Section 11.4) or any of the other Loan Documents or to enter into additional Loan Documents as the Administrative Agent reasonably deems appropriate in order to effectuate the terms of Section 3.9 (including as applicable, (1) to permit the Incremental Increases to share ratably in the benefits of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, (2) to include an Incremental Increase, as applicable, in any determination of (i) Required Lenders or (ii) similar required 92lender terms applicable thereto); provided that no amendment or modification shall result in any increase in the amount of any Lender’s Revolving Loan Commitment or any increase in any Lender’s Commitment Percentage, in each case, without the written consent of such affected Lender.(b)    No failure on the part of Administrative Agent or any Lender to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power, privilege or remedy under any Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right, power, privilege or remedy preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power, privilege or remedy.(c)    This Agreement cannot be changed orally or by the conduct of the parties and may be amended or modified only in writing signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought.11.5    REVERSAL OF PAYMENTSTo the extent any Loan Party makes a payment or payments to the Administrative Agent for the ratable benefit of any of the Holders of Obligations or to any Holder of Obligations directly or the Administrative Agent or any Holder of Obligations receives any payment or exercises its right of setoff or recoupment, which payments or proceeds (including any proceeds of such setoff or recoupment) or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside and/or required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party under any Debtor Relief Law, other applicable law or equitable cause, then, to the extent of such payment or proceeds repaid, the Obligations or part thereof intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment or proceeds had not been received by the Administrative Agent, and each Lender and each Issuing Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent upon demand its (or its applicable Affiliate’s) applicable ratable share (without duplication) of any amount so recovered from or repaid by the Administrative Agent plus interest thereon at a per annum rate equal to the NYFRB Rate from the date of such demand to the date such payment is made to the Administrative Agent.11.6    INJUNCTIVE RELIEFThe Borrower recognizes that, in the event the Borrower fails to perform, observe or discharge any of its obligations or liabilities under this Agreement, any remedy of law may prove to be inadequate relief to the Lenders. Therefore, the Borrower agrees that the Lenders, at the Lenders’ option, shall be entitled to temporary and permanent injunctive relief in any such case without the necessity of proving actual damages.11.7    SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS; LENDER ASSIGNMENT(a)    The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any attempted assignment or transfer by Borrower without such consent shall be null and void). Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants to the extent provided in subsection (d) below and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Indemnitees) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.93(b)    Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more Eligible Assignees (as defined in subsection (h) below) all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Revolving Loan Commitment and the Loans (including for purposes of this subsection (b), Participations (as defined in subsection (d) below) in Swing Loans) at the time owing to it); provided that (i) except in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender’s Revolving Loan Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it or in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund with respect to a Lender, the aggregate amount of the Revolving Loan Commitment (which for this purpose includes Loans outstanding thereunder) subject to each such assignment, determined as of the date of the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to Administrative Agent shall not be less than $5,000,000 unless Administrative Agent and, so long as no Event of Default is continuing, Borrower otherwise consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), (ii) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Loans or the Revolving Loan Commitment assigned, (iii) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500 and (iv) the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire in which the assignee designates one or more credit contacts to whom all syndicate-level information (which may contain material non-public information about Borrower, the other Loan Parties and their Related Parties or their respective securities) will be made available and who may receive such information in accordance with the assignee’s compliance procedures and applicable laws, including Federal and state securities laws.  Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection (c) below, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the Eligible Assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 10.3 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this subsection shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a Participation (as defined in subsection (d) below) in such rights and obligations in accordance with subsection (d) below. The assignee shall, on or prior to the date on which the assignment is made, deliver to Borrower and to Administrative Agent the appropriate IRS form as prescribed by Section 3.1 of this Agreement. If an assignment of all or a portion of a Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement would result (under the terms of Section 3.1) in any payment by Borrower of additional sums, notwithstanding Section 3.1 or any other provision set forth in this Agreement, Borrower shall not be obligated to pay such additional sums.(c)    Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of Borrower, shall maintain at Administrative Agent’s Office a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Revolving Loan Commitments of, and principal amounts (and stated interest) of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the “Register”). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, absent manifest error, for purposes of determining each Lender’s share of the Loans and the Revolving Loan Commitments, and Borrower, Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.94(d)    Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, Borrower or Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural person (or a company, investment vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated for the primary benefit of, a natural person or relative(s) thereof), a Defaulting Lender or Borrower or any of Borrower’s affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a “Participant”) in all or a portion of such Lender’s rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Revolving Commitment and/or the Loans (including such Lender’s participations in Swing Loans) owing to it) (a “Participation”); provided that (i) such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, (iii) Borrower, Administrative Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, and (iv) the Participant shall have no rights against Borrower or any Subsidiaries or Administrative Agent, and Borrower and Administrative Agent need give notices to and deal only with such Lender and shall have no obligation to any Participant. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other modification that would (i) postpone any date upon which any payment of money is scheduled to be paid to such Participant, (ii) reduce the principal, interest, fees or other amounts payable to such Participant, or (iii) release Borrower from its guaranty hereunder or any Guarantor from any Guaranty.  Subject to subsection (e) below, Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.1, 3.4 and 3.5 to the same extent as if it were a Lender (provided it complies in fact with all the obligations of, and requirements imposed on, Lenders thereunder to the same extent as were it a Lender) and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) above.  To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 11.8 as though it were a Lender; provided that Borrower shall have been provided with written notice of the identity of such Participant at least five Business Days prior to the exercise of such benefits; provided, further that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.7(c) as though it were a Lender.  Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant’s interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the “Participant Register”); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant’s interest in any commitments, loans or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations.  The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.(e)    Notwithstanding any other provision set forth in this Agreement, a Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under the Agreement than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the Participation sold to such Participant.(f)    Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations, to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.95(g)    If the consent of Borrower to an assignment or to an Eligible Assignee is required hereunder (including a consent to an assignment which does not meet the minimum assignment threshold specified in clause (i) of the proviso to the first sentence of Section 11.7(b)), Borrower shall be deemed to have given its consent ten (10) Business Days after the date notice thereof has been given to Borrower by the assigning Lender (through Administrative Agent) unless such consent is expressly refused by Borrower prior to the close of business on such tenth (10th) Business Day.(h)    As used herein, the following terms have the following meanings:“Eligible Assignee” means (a) a Lender; (b) an affiliate of a Lender; (c) an Approved Fund; and (d) any other Person (other than a natural person or a company, investment vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated for the primary benefit of, a natural person or relative(s) thereof) that is a financial institution approved by (i) Administrative Agent (provided that no consent of the Administrative Agent shall be required for an assignment of any Revolving Loan Commitment to an assignee that is a Lender (other than a Defaulting Lender) with a Revolving Loan Commitment immediately prior to giving effect to such assignment), (ii) the Swing Line Lender, (iii) each Issuing Lender, and (iv) unless (A) such Person is taking delivery of an assignment in connection with physical settlement of a credit derivative transaction or (B) an Event of Default is continuing, Borrower (each such approval referred to in clauses (i) through (iv) not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, “Eligible Assignee” shall not include Borrower or any of Borrower’s affiliates or Subsidiaries.“Fund” means any Person (other than a natural person or a company, investment vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated for the primary benefit of, a natural person or relative(s) thereof) that is (or will be) engaged in making, purchasing, holding or otherwise investing in commercial loans and similar extensions of credit in the ordinary course of its business.“Approved Fund” means any Fund that is administered or managed by (a) a Lender, (b) an affiliate of a Lender or (c) an entity or an affiliate of an entity that administers or manages a Lender.(i)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if at any time JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. assigns all of its Revolving Loan Commitment and Loans pursuant to subsection (b) above, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. may, upon five (5) Business Days’ notice to Borrower terminate the Swing Loan facility hereunder and its commitment to issue Letters of Credit hereunder.  In the event of any such termination of the Swing Loan facility hereunder or such commitment to issue Letters of Credit, Borrower shall be entitled to appoint from among the Lenders a successor Swing Line Lender or Issuing Lender, as applicable, hereunder; provided, however, that no failure by Borrower to appoint any such successor shall affect the termination of the Swing Loan facility hereunder or such commitment to issue Letters of Credit.  If JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. terminates the Swing Loan facility hereunder or its commitment to issue Letters of Credit, it shall retain all the rights of the Swing Line Lender or an Issuing Lender, as applicable, provided for hereunder with respect to (x) in the case of the Swing Loan facility hereunder, Swing Loans made by it and outstanding as of the effective date of such termination, including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Loans or fund participations in outstanding Swing Loans pursuant to Section 2.2 or (y) in the case of Letters of Credit, Letters of Credit issued by it and outstanding as of the effective date of such termination, including the right to require Lenders to make Base Rate Loans or fund participations in outstanding Letters of Credit pursuant to Section 2.1B, as the case may be.(j)    In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments to the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with the consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, 96the applicable pro rata share of Loans previously requested, but not funded by, the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (i) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Lender, the Swing Line Lender and each other Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon), and (ii) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro rata share of all Loans and participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Loans in accordance with its Commitment Percentage.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under applicable law without compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs.11.8    SETOFFIn addition to any rights and remedies of Lenders provided by law, each Lender shall have the right, with the prior consent of Administrative Agent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld) but without prior notice to Borrower, any such notice being expressly waived by Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law, during the continuance of an Event of Default to setoff and apply against any indebtedness, whether matured or unmatured, of Borrower to such Lender any amount owing from such Lender or any affiliate thereof to Borrower at any time during the continuation of an Event of Default. This right of setoff may be exercised by such Lender against Borrower or against any trustee in bankruptcy, debtor in possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, receiver or execution, judgment or attachment creditor of Borrower or against anyone else claiming through or against Borrower or such trustee in bankruptcy, debtor in possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, receiver, or execution, judgment or attachment creditor, notwithstanding the fact that such right of setoff shall not have been exercised by such Lender prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify Borrower after any such setoff and application made by such Lender, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any Defaulting Lender shall exercise any such right of setoff, (a) all amounts so setoff shall be paid over immediately to Administrative Agent for further application in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.7 and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lenders, and the Lenders, and (b) the Defaulting Lender shall provide promptly to Administrative Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the Obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as to which it exercised such right of setoff.11.9    CUMULATIVE REMEDIESThe rights and remedies under the Loan Documents are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, powers, privileges and remedies that may otherwise be available to Administrative Agent or any Lender.11.10    ENTIRE AGREEMENTThe Loan Documents constitute the entire agreement among Borrower, Administrative Agent and Lenders with respect to the Loans and supersede all prior negotiations, communications, discussions, correspondence and agreements concerning the subject matter hereof.  This Agreement shall remain in effect from the Closing Date through and including the date upon which all Obligations (other than (1) contingent indemnification obligations not then due and (2) Guaranteed Cash Management Obligations or Guaranteed Hedge Obligations as to which arrangements satisfactory to the applicable holders thereof shall have been made) arising hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall have been paid and satisfied in full in cash, all Letters of Credit have been terminated or expired (or Cash Collateralized) and the Revolving Loan Commitments have been terminated.  No termination of this Agreement shall affect 97the rights and obligations of the parties hereto arising prior to such termination or in respect of any provision of this Agreement which survives such termination.11.11    CONFIDENTIALITYLenders shall hold all non-public information (which has been identified as such by Borrower) obtained pursuant to the requirements of this Agreement in accordance with their customary procedures for handling confidential information of this nature and in accordance with safe and sound banking practices and may make disclosure to any of their examiners, affiliates, outside auditors, counsel and other professional advisors in connection with this Agreement or as reasonably required by any bona fide transferee, participant or assignee or as required or requested by any Governmental Authority or pursuant to legal process; provided, however, that (a) unless specifically prohibited by applicable law or court order, each Lender shall notify Borrower of any request by any Governmental Authority (other than any such request in connection with an examination of the financial condition of such Lender by such Governmental Authority) for disclosure of any such non-public information prior to disclosure of such information, (b) prior to any such disclosure pursuant to this Section, each Lender shall require any such bona fide transferee, participant and assignee receiving a disclosure of non-public information to agree in writing (i) to be bound by this Section (or an agreement containing the terms set forth in this Section) and (ii) to require such Person to require any other Person to whom such Person discloses such non-public information to be similarly bound by this Section (or an agreement containing the terms set forth in this Section), (c) except as may be required by an order of a court of competent jurisdiction and to the extent set forth therein, no Lender shall be obligated or required to return any materials furnished by Borrower or Subsidiary, (d) such information may be disclosed to any other party hereto, (e) such information may be disclosed in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or under any other Loan Document or any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, (f) such information may be disclosed on a confidential basis to (i) any rating agency in connection with rating Borrower or its Subsidiaries or the Revolving Loans or (ii) the CUSIP Service Bureau or any similar agency in connection with the issuance and monitoring of CUSIP numbers with respect to the Revolving Loans, (g) such information may be disclosed with the consent of Borrower, (h) such information may be disclosed to the extent such information (x) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section, or (y) becomes available to Administrative Agent, any Lender, or any of their respective Affiliates on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than Borrower who did not acquire such information as a result of a breach of this Section, and (i) the parties hereto may disclose information pertaining to this Agreement routinely provided by arrangers to data service providers, including league table providers, that serve the lending industry.11.12    TIMETime is of the essence of each and every provision of this Agreement and each of the other Loan Documents.11.13    SEVERABILITY OF PROVISIONSIf any provision of this Agreement shall be prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity without invalidating the remainder of such provision or any remaining provisions of this Agreement.11.14    COUNTERPARTSThis Agreement may be executed in any number of identical counterparts, any set of which signed by all the parties hereto shall be deemed to constitute a complete, executed original for all purposes.

Borrower further agrees that the due and punctual payment of such Specified Ancillary Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice to or further assent from it, and that it will remain bound upon its guarantee hereunder notwithstanding any such extension or renewal of any such Specified Ancillary Obligation.Borrower waives presentment to, demand of payment from and protest to any Subsidiary of any of the Specified Ancillary Obligations, and also waives notice of acceptance of its obligations and notice of protest for nonpayment.  The obligations of Borrower hereunder shall not be affected by: (a) the failure of any applicable Lender (or any of its Affiliates) to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against any Subsidiary under the provisions of any Guaranteed Cash Management Agreement, any Guaranteed Hedge Agreement or otherwise; (b) any extension or renewal of any of the Specified Ancillary Obligations; (c) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of, or release from, any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement, any other Loan Document, any Guaranteed Cash Management Agreement, any Guaranteed Hedge Agreement or other agreement; (d) any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of any of the Specified Ancillary Obligations; (e) the failure of any applicable Lender (or any of its Affiliates) to take any steps to perfect and maintain any security interest in, or to preserve any rights to, any security or collateral for the Specified Ancillary Obligations, if any; (f) any change in the corporate, partnership or other existence, structure or ownership of any Subsidiary or any other guarantor of any of the Specified Ancillary Obligations; (g) the enforceability or validity of the Specified Ancillary Obligations or any part thereof or the genuineness, enforceability or validity of any agreement relating thereto or with respect to any collateral securing the Specified Ancillary Obligations or any part thereof, or any other invalidity or unenforceability relating to or against any Subsidiary or any other guarantor of any of the Specified Ancillary Obligations, for any reason related to this Agreement, any other Loan Document, any Guaranteed Cash Management Agreement, any Guaranteed Hedge Agreement, or any provision of applicable law, decree, order or regulation of any jurisdiction purporting to prohibit the payment by such Subsidiary or any other guarantor of the Specified Ancillary Obligations, of any of the Specified Ancillary Obligations or otherwise affecting any term of 104any of the Specified Ancillary Obligations; or (h) any other act, omission or delay to do any other act which may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of Borrower or otherwise operate as a discharge of a guarantor as a matter of law or equity or which would impair or eliminate any right of Borrower to subrogation.Borrower further agrees that its agreement hereunder constitutes a guarantee of payment when due (whether or not any bankruptcy or similar proceeding shall have stayed the accrual or collection of any of the Specified Ancillary Obligations or operated as a discharge thereof) and not merely of collection, and waives any right to require that any resort be had by any applicable Lender (or any of its Affiliates) to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of Administrative Agent, any Issuing Lender or any Lender in favor of any Subsidiary or any other Person.The obligations of Borrower hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason, and shall not be subject to any defense or set-off, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever, by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of any of the Specified Ancillary Obligations, any impossibility in the performance of any of the Specified Ancillary Obligations or otherwise.Borrower further agrees that its obligations hereunder shall constitute a continuing and irrevocable guarantee of all Specified Ancillary Obligations now or hereafter existing and shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any Specified Ancillary Obligation (including a payment effected through exercise of a right of setoff or recoupment) is rescinded, or is or must otherwise be restored or returned by any applicable Lender (or any of its Affiliates) upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of any Subsidiary or otherwise (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by a holder of Specified Ancillary Obligations in its discretion).In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right which any applicable Lender (or any of its Affiliates) may have at law or in equity against Borrower by virtue hereof, upon the failure of any Subsidiary to pay any Specified Ancillary Obligation when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, after notice of prepayment or otherwise, Borrower hereby promises to and will, upon receipt of written demand by any applicable Lender (or any of its Affiliates), forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, to such applicable Lender (or any of its Affiliates) in cash an amount equal to the unpaid principal amount of such Specified Ancillary Obligations then due, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon.Upon payment by Borrower of any sums as provided above, all rights of Borrower against any Subsidiary arising as a result thereof by way of right of subrogation or otherwise shall in all respects be subordinated and junior in right of payment to the prior indefeasible payment in full in cash of all the Specified Ancillary Obligations owed by such Subsidiary to the applicable Lender (or its applicable Affiliates).Nothing shall discharge or satisfy the liability of Borrower hereunder except the full performance and payment in cash of the Obligations (other than contingent indemnification obligations not then due).Borrower hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably undertakes to provide such funds or other support as may be needed from time to time by each other Loan Party to honor all of its obligations under any Guaranty in respect of Swap Obligations (provided that Borrower shall only be liable under this paragraph for the maximum amount of such liability that can be hereby incurred without rendering its obligations under this paragraph or otherwise under this Article XII voidable under applicable law 105relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer, and not for any greater amount).  Borrower intends that this paragraph constitute, and this paragraph shall be deemed to constitute, a “keepwell, support, or other agreement” for the benefit of each other Loan Party for all purposes of Section 1a(18)(A)(v)(II) of the Commodity Exchange Act.[Signature Pages Follow]106IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Credit Agreement has been duly executed as of the date first written above.COLUMBIA SPORTSWEAR COMPANY,as BorrowerBy:     /s/ JIM A.
