ARTICLE II

THE COMMITMENTS AND BORROWINGS
 
SECTION 2.01     Commitments and Loans. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, each Lender severally agrees to make revolving loans in Dollars to the Borrower (each such loan, an “Initial Loan”) from time to time, on any Business Day during the applicable Commitment Period, in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed at any time outstanding the amount of such Lender’s Initial Commitment; provided that, after giving effect to any Borrowing, the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Loans of any Lender shall not exceed such Lender’s Initial Commitment. Within the limits of each Lender’s Initial Commitment, and subject to the other terms and conditions hereof, the Borrower may borrow under this Section 2.01, prepay under Section 2.05, and, prior to the Conversion Date, reborrow under this Section 2.01. Amounts borrowed under this Section 2.01 and repaid or prepaid may not be reborrowed on or after the Conversion Date.
 
SECTION 2.02     Borrowings.
 
(a)     Each Borrowing of Loans shall be made upon the Borrower’s irrevocable delivery to the Administrative Agent of a Loan Notice (which may be given by telephone as provided below), appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower. Each such notice must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 12:00 p.m. (noon) one (1) Business Day prior to the requested date of any Borrowing of Loans. Each telephonic notice delivered pursuant to this Section 2.02(a) must be confirmed promptly by delivery to the Administrative Agent of a written Loan Notice, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower. Each Borrowing of Loans shall be in a principal amount of $500,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof. Each Loan Notice (whether telephonic or written) shall specify (i)  the requested date of the Borrowing, (which shall be a Business Day), (ii) the principal amount of Loans to be borrowed and (iii)  the account of the Borrower to be credited with the proceeds of such Borrowing.   
 
(b)     Following receipt of a Loan Notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Appropriate Lender of the amount of its Pro Rata Share of the applicable Class of Loans. In the case of each Borrowing, each Appropriate Lender shall make the amount of its Loan available to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds at the Administrative Agent’s Office not later than 1:00 p.m. on the Business Day specified in the applicable Loan Notice.  Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Administrative Agent shall make all funds so received available to the Borrower in like funds as received by the Administrative Agent by wire transfer of such funds in accordance with instructions provided to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower.
 
(c)     The failure of any Lender to make the Loan to be made by it as part of any Borrowing shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Loan on the date of such Borrowing, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the Loan to be made by such other Lender on the date of any Borrowing. 
 

42

 

 
SECTION 2.03     Prepayments.
 
(a)     (i) The Borrower may, at its option, upon notice to the Administrative Agent (a “Prepayment Notice”), at any time, voluntarily prepay the principal outstanding amount of the Initial Loans made to the Borrower, in whole or in part, plus (a) all accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount to be prepaid to, but excluding the date of, prepayment and (b) in the case of a voluntary prepayment (other than in connection with a payment made in accordance with Section 6.16(e) pursuant to a Change of Control Offer) made on or after the Conversion Date but prior to the first anniversary of the Conversion Date, a premium in an amount equal to 1.00% of the aggregate principal amount of the Initial Loans so prepaid; provided, that (1) such notice must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 12:00 p.m., one (1) Business Day prior to any date of prepayment; (2) any prepayment of Initial Loans shall be in a principal amount of $250,000 or a whole multiple of $50,000 in excess thereof or, in each case, if less, the entire principal amount thereof then outstanding. Each such notice shall specify the date and amount of such prepayment and the Class(es) of Loans to be prepaid. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Appropriate Lender of its receipt of each such notice, and of the amount of such Lender’s Pro Rata Share of such prepayment. The Borrower shall make such prepayment and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein. Each prepayment of the Loans pursuant to this Section 2.03(a) shall be applied among the Facilities in such amounts as the relevant Borrower may direct in its sole discretion (and absent such direction, pro rata among the Facilities and in direct order of maturity). Each prepayment made by any Borrower in respect of a particular Facility shall be paid to the Administrative Agent for the account of (and to be promptly disbursed to) the Appropriate Lenders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares. The Administrative Agent shall have no obligation to calculate, or confirm the accuracy of, any prepayment premium.
 
(ii)     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Borrower may rescind any notice of prepayment under Section 2.03(a)(i) if such prepayment would have resulted from (A) a refinancing of all of the Facilities, which refinancing shall not be consummated or shall otherwise be delayed or (B) the refinancing of all or a portion of the Facilities pursuant to a permitted refinancing hereunder, which refinancing shall not be consummated or shall otherwise be delayed. Notices of prepayment may, at the Borrower’s discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent, including, but not limited to, completion of an Equity Offering, another offering or another transaction or event. 
 
(iii)     On and after the Conversion Date, in the event and on each occasion that Holdings, the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary makes an Asset Disposition which results in the realization or receipt of Net Cash Proceeds, such Net Cash Proceeds of an Asset Disposition shall, subject to Section 2.03(c) below, within one year, at Holding’s election: 
 
(A)     be used pursuant to Section 2.03(a)(vi), 
 
(B)     be used to permanently prepay or permanently repay any (i) Indebtedness which had been secured by the assets sold in the relevant Asset Disposition, or (ii) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor, or
 
(C)     be used to permanently prepay or permanently repay, subject to Section 2.03(b)(iii), the Loans, and, if Holdings or a Restricted Subsidiary elects or is required to do so, to repay, purchase or redeem any unsubordinated Indebtedness (on a pro rata basis if the amount available for such repayment, purchase, or redemption is less than the aggregate amount of (x) the aggregate principal amount of Loans held by the Lenders who have not provided a Rejection Notice pursuant to Section 2.03(b)(iii) and (y) the lesser of the principal amount, or accreted value, of such unsubordinated Indebtedness tendered or to be repaid, repurchased or redeemed, plus, in each case, accrued interest to the date of repayment, purchase or redemption) at 100% of the principal amount or accreted value thereof, as the case may be, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase, repayment or redemption; 
 
provided that pending any such application under this Section 2.03(a)(iii), Net Cash Proceeds may be used to temporarily reduce Indebtedness or otherwise be invested in any manner not prohibited by this Agreement. 
 

43

 

 
(iv)     On or after the Conversion Date, in the event and on each occasion that a Casualty Event occurs, which results in the realization or receipt of Net Cash Proceeds, such Net Cash Proceeds of a Casualty Event shall, within one year, at Holding’s election:
 
(A)     be used pursuant to Section 2.03(a)(vi),
 
(B)     be used to permanently prepay or permanently repay any (i) Indebtedness which had been secured by the assets that are the subject of such Casualty Event, or (ii) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor, or
 
(C)     be used to permanently prepay or permanently repay, subject to Section 2.03(b)(iii), the Loans, and, if Holdings or a Restricted Subsidiary elects or is required to do so, to repay, purchase or redeem any unsubordinated Indebtedness (on a pro rata basis if the amount available for such repayment, purchase, or redemption is less than the aggregate amount of (x) the aggregate principal amount of Loans held by the Lenders who have not provided a Rejection Notice pursuant to Section 2.03(b)(iii), and (y) the lesser of the principal amount, or accreted value, of such unsubordinated Indebtedness tendered or to be repaid, repurchased or redeemed, plus, in each case, accrued interest to the date of repayment, purchase or redemption) at 100% of the principal amount or accreted value thereof, as the case may be, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase, repayment or redemption;
 
provided that pending any such application under this Section 2.03(a)(iv), Net Cash Proceeds may be used to temporarily reduce Indebtedness or otherwise be invested in any manner not prohibited by this Agreement.
 
(v)     On or after the Conversion Date, in the event and on each occasion that any Other Prepayment Event occurs, which results in the realization or receipt of Net Cash Proceeds, the Borrower shall prepay, or cause to be prepaid, subject to Section 2.03(b)(iii), on or prior to the date which is ten (10) Business Days after the date of realization or receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds, an aggregate principal amount of Loans equal to 100% of all Net Cash Proceeds realized or received.
 
(vi)     In lieu of the prepayments set forth in clauses (iii), (iv) and (v) above, with respect to any Net Cash Proceeds realized or received with respect to any Asset Disposition or any Casualty Event, the Borrower or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries may, at its option, reinvest the Net Cash Proceeds from such event (or a portion thereof) within 12 months after receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds in assets (including Capital Stock of any Person that is or will be a Restricted Subsidiary following investment therein) used or useful in a Real Estate Business (to the extent the assets that were the subject of such Asset Disposition or Casualty Event were Collateral, such reinvested assets (other than Excluded Property) shall be pledged as Collateral under the Collateral Documents to the extent required by Section 6.14(b) hereto, with the Lien on such Collateral securing the Loans being of the same priority with respect to the Loans as the Liens on the assets disposed of).
 
(vii)     If, prior to the Conversion Date, for any reason the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Loans at any time exceeds the Aggregate Commitments then in effect, the Borrower shall promptly prepay Loans in an aggregate amount equal to such excess. 
 

44

 

 
(b)     Application of Prepayments.
 
(i)      All prepayments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.03(a)(iii), (iv), (v), and (vii) shall be applied to prepay the Loans among the various Classes thereof on a ratable basis (in accordance with the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Loans of each such Class) in order of maturity, unless otherwise agreed among the Borrower and the lenders providing Extended Loans in accordance with Section 2.13 (it being understood that, in any case, the Initial Loans shall not be allocated any less than such Class’s pro rata share of such prepayment). Unless otherwise provided herein, each such prepayment shall be paid to the Lenders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares. 
 
(ii)     [Reserved]. 
 
(iii)     Declined Proceeds. The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent in writing of any mandatory prepayments of Loans required to be made pursuant to Section 2.03(a)(iii), (iv), (v), and (vii) no less than ten (10) Business Days before the date of such mandatory prepayment. Each such notice shall specify the date of such prepayment and provide a reasonably detailed calculation of the aggregate amount of such prepayment to be made by the Borrower. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Lender of the contents of the Borrower’s prepayment notice and of each Lender’s Pro Rata Share, or other applicable share provided for under this Agreement. Each Lender may reject all or a portion of its Pro Rata Share, or other applicable share provided for under this Agreement, of such mandatory prepayment (such declined amounts, the “Declined Proceeds”) of Loans, by providing written notice to the Administrative Agent (a “Rejection Notice”) no later than 5:00 p.m., New York time, five (5) Business Days after the date of such Lender’s receipt of notice from the Administrative Agent regarding such prepayment. A Rejection Notice from a Lender shall specify the principal amount of the mandatory repayment of Loans to be declined by such Lender. If a Lender fails to deliver a Rejection Notice to the Administrative Agent within the time frame specified above, or the Rejection Notice fails to specify the principal amount of the Loans to be declined, it will be deemed an acceptance of the total amount of such mandatory prepayment of Loans. 
 
(iv)     Any Declined Proceeds may be used by Holdings, the Borrower and the Subsidiaries for general corporate purposes (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the repayment or repurchase of Indebtedness), subject to the other covenants hereunder.
 
(c)     Threshold. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrower will not be required to make a prepayment from such Net Cash Proceeds in accordance with Section 2.03(a)(iii) except to the extent that such Net Cash Proceeds, together with the aggregate Net Cash Proceeds of prior Asset Dispositions (other than those so used) which have not been applied in accordance with this Section 2.03 and as to which no prior prepayments or repayments shall have been made, exceed $25.0 million.
 
SECTION 2.04     Termination of Commitments.
 
(a)     Optional. The Borrower may, prior to the Conversion Date, upon written notice to the Administrative Agent, terminate the unused Commitments of any Class, or from time to time permanently reduce the unused Commitments of any Class; provided that (i) any such notice shall be received by the Administrative Agent three (3) Business Days’ prior to the date of termination or reduction, (ii) any such partial reduction shall be in an aggregate amount (A) of $250,000 or any whole multiple of $50,000 in excess thereof or (B) equal to the entire remaining amount of the Commitments of any Class. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrower may rescind or postpone any notice of termination of the Commitments if such termination would have resulted from the refinancing of all of the Facilities, which issuance or refinancing shall not be consummated or otherwise shall be delayed.
 

45

 

 
(b)     Application of Commitment Reductions; Payment of Fees. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Appropriate Lenders of any termination or reduction of unused portions of the unused Commitments of any Class under this Section 2.04(a). Upon any reduction of unused Commitments of any Class, the Commitment of each Lender of such Class shall be reduced by such Lender’s Pro Rata Share of the amount by which such Commitments are reduced except as otherwise provided in this Agreement (including the termination of the Commitment of any Lender as provided in Section 2.15 or Section 3.07). All commitment fees accrued until the effective date of any termination of the Commitments of any Class shall be paid to the Appropriate Lenders on the effective date of such termination.
 
(c)     Conversion Date. The Initial Commitment of the Initial Lenders shall be automatically and permanently reduced to $0 on the Conversion Date.
 
(d)     Closing Date. If the Closing Date does not occur on or prior to the Commitment Termination Date, the Initial Commitments shall immediately and automatically terminate. 
 
SECTION 2.05     Repayment of Loans
 
Payment at Maturity. The Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay to the Administrative Agent for the ratable account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of the Loans on the Maturity Date of the applicable Facility in an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of all Loans of such Class outstanding on such date.
 
SECTION 2.06     Interest.
 
(a)     Subject to the provisions of Section 2.06(b),  each Initial Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to the Applicable Rate.
 
(b)     While any Event of Default set forth in Sections 7.01(i) or (ii) (as applicable) exists with respect to the payment of any principal, interest or fees, or any Event of Default set forth in Sections 7.01(vii) or (viii), the Borrower shall pay interest on all overdue amounts hereunder at an interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws. Accrued and unpaid interest on past due amounts (including interest on past due interest) shall be due and payable upon demand.
 
(c)     Interest on each Loan shall be due and payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date applicable thereto and at such other times as may be specified herein. Interest hereunder shall be due and payable in accordance with the terms hereof before and after judgment, and before and after the commencement of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law.
 
SECTION 2.07     Fees. 
 
The Borrower shall pay or cause to be paid to the Agents such fees as shall have been separately agreed upon in writing in the amounts and at the times so specified. Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever.
 

46

 

 
SECTION 2.08     Computation of Interest and Fees. All computations of interest and other fees shall be made on the basis of a year of three hundred and sixty (360) days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed. Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion is paid; provided that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall, subject to Section 2.10(a), bear interest for one (1) day. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.
 
SECTION 2.09     Evidence of Indebtedness.
 
(a)     The Loans made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and evidenced by one or more entries in the Register maintained by the Administrative Agent in accordance with Section 9.07(c), acting as a non-fiduciary agent solely for purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 5f.103-1(c), as agent for the Borrower, in each case in the ordinary course of business. The accounts or records maintained by each Lender shall be prima facie evidence absent manifest error of the amount of the Loans made by the Lenders to the Borrower and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Loan Obligations. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the Register in respect of such matters, the Register shall control in the absence of manifest error. Upon the request of any Lender made through the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative Agent) a Note payable to such Lender, which shall evidence such Lender’s Loans in addition to such accounts or records. Each Lender may attach schedules to its Note and endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto.
 
(b)     Entries made in good faith by the Administrative Agent in the Register pursuant to Section 2.09(a), and by each Lender in its account or accounts pursuant to Section 2.09(a), shall be prima facie evidence of the amount of principal and interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to, in the case of the Register, each Lender and, in the case of such account or accounts, such Lender, under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, absent manifest error; provided that the failure of the Administrative Agent or such Lender to make an entry, or any finding that an entry is incorrect, in the Register or such account or accounts shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.
 
SECTION 2.10     Payments Generally.
 
(a)     Except as otherwise required by applicable Law, all payments to be made by the Borrower shall be made without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrower hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the Administrative Agent’s Office in Dollars and in immediately available funds not later than noon, 12:00 p.m., on the Business Day specified herein. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Pro Rata Share (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender’s Lending Office. All payments received by the Administrative Agent after noon, 12:00 p.m., shall be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day in the Administrative Agent’s sole discretion and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue to the extent applicable.
 

47

 

 
(b)     Unless the Borrower or any Lender has notified the Administrative Agent, prior to the date any payment is required to be made by it to the Administrative Agent hereunder, that the Borrower or such Lender, as the case may be, will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower or such Lender, as the case may be, has timely made such payment and may (but shall not be so required to), in reliance thereon, make available a corresponding amount to the Person entitled thereto. If and to the extent that such payment was not in fact made to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds, then:
 
(i)     if the Borrower failed to make such payment, each Lender shall forthwith on demand repay to the Administrative Agent the portion of such assumed payment that was made available to such Lender in immediately available funds, together with interest thereon in respect of each day from and including the date such amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to such Lender to the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds at the applicable Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect; and
 
(ii)     if any Lender failed to make such payment, such Lender shall forthwith on demand pay to the Administrative Agent the amount thereof in immediately available funds, together with interest thereon for the period from the date such amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower to the date such amount is recovered by the Administrative Agent (the “Compensation Period”) at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect. When such Lender makes payment to the Administrative Agent (together with all accrued interest thereon), then such payment amount (excluding the amount of any interest which may have accrued and been paid in respect of such late payment) shall constitute such Lender’s Loan included in the applicable Borrowing. If such Lender does not pay such amount forthwith upon the Administrative Agent’s demand therefor, the Administrative Agent may make a demand therefor upon the Borrower, and the Borrower shall pay such amount to the Administrative Agent, together with interest thereon for the Compensation Period at a rate per annum equal to the rate of interest applicable to the applicable Borrowing. Nothing herein shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill its Commitment or to prejudice any rights which the Administrative Agent or the Borrower may have against any Lender as a result of any Default by such Lender hereunder.
 
A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this Section 2.10(b) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.
 
(c)     If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in this Article 2, and such funds are not made available to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable Borrowing set forth in Article 4 are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall promptly return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest.
 
(d)     The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Loans are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan or to fund any such participation on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan or purchase its participation.
 
(e)     Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner.
 

48

 

 
(f)     Whenever any payment received by the Administrative Agent under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents is insufficient to pay in full all amounts then due and payable to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders under or in respect of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents on any date, such payment shall be distributed by the Administrative Agent and applied by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in the order of priority set forth in clauses First through Last of Section 7.03. If the Administrative Agent receives funds for application to the Loan Obligations of the Loan Parties under or in respect of the Loan Documents under circumstances for which the Loan Documents do not specify the manner in which such funds are to be applied, the Administrative Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, elect to distribute such funds to each of the Lenders in accordance with such Lender’s Pro Rata Share of the Outstanding Amount of all Loans outstanding at such time, in repayment or prepayment of such of the outstanding Loans or other Loan Obligations then owing to such Lender.
 
SECTION 2.11     Sharing of Payments. If any Lender shall obtain on account of the Loans made by it, any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of setoff, or otherwise, and other than (x) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or Participant or (y) as otherwise expressly provided elsewhere herein, including, without limitation, as provided in or contemplated by Section 2.13,Section 2.13(a) Section 2.14 or Section 9.01) in excess of its ratable share (or other share contemplated hereunder) thereof, such Lender shall immediately (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact and (b) purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the Loans made by them, as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment in respect of such Loans or such participations, as the case may be, pro rata with each of them (and notify the Administrative Agent of such purchase); provided that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from the purchasing Lender under any of the circumstances described in Section 9.06 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the purchasing Lender in its discretion), such purchase shall to that extent be rescinded and each other Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price paid therefor, together with an amount equal to such paying Lender’s ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such paying Lender’s required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered, without further interest thereon. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender may, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of setoff, but subject to Section 9.09) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation. The Administrative Agent will keep records and maintain entries in the Register (which shall be conclusive and binding in the absence of manifest error) of participations purchased under this Section 2.11 and will in each case notify the Lenders following any such purchases or repayments. Each Lender that purchases a participation pursuant to this Section 2.11 shall from and after such purchase have the right to give all notices, requests, demands, directions and other communications under this Agreement with respect to the portion of the Loan Obligations purchased to the same extent as though the purchasing Lender were the original owner of the Loan Obligations purchased.
 
SECTION 2.12     [Reserved]. 
 
SECTION 2.13     Extensions of Loans.
 
(a)     On and after the Conversion Date, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, pursuant to one or more offers (each, an “Extension Offer”) made from time to time by the Borrower to all Lenders of any Class of Loans with a like Maturity Date, in each case on a pro rata basis (based on the aggregate outstanding principal amount of such Loans) and on the same terms to each such Lender, the Borrower is hereby permitted to consummate from time to time transactions with individual Lenders that accept the terms contained in such Extension Offers to extend the Maturity Date of each such Lender’s Loans and otherwise modify the terms of such Loans, subject to the provisions below, pursuant to the terms of the relevant Extension Offer (including, without limitation, by increasing the fees (other than fees on undrawn amounts) payable in respect of such Loans (and related outstandings) (each, an “Extension”, and each group of Loans, in each case as so extended, as well as the original Initial Loans (in each case not so extended), being a “tranche”; any Extended Loans shall constitute a separate tranche of Loans from the tranche of Loans from which they were converted), so long as the following terms are satisfied: 
 

49

 

 
(i)     no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time the offering document in respect of an Extension Offer is delivered to the Lenders or at the time of the effectiveness of the Extension; 
 
(ii)     except as to interest rates, fees, amortization, final Maturity Date, premium, required prepayment dates and participation in prepayments (which shall, subject to the immediately succeeding clauses (iii), (iv) and (v), be determined between the Borrower and set forth in the relevant Extension Offer), the Loans of any Lender that agrees to an Extension with respect to such Loans (an “Extending Lender”) extended pursuant to any Extension (“Extended Loans”) shall have the same terms as the tranche of Loans subject to such Extension Offer; 
 
(iii)     the final Maturity Date of any Extended Loans shall be no earlier than the Latest Maturity Date of the Loans extended thereby;
 
(iv)     the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of any Extended Loans shall be no shorter than the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of the Loans extended thereby; 
 
(v)     any Extended Loans may participate on a pro rata basis or a less than pro rata basis (but not greater than a pro rata basis) in any voluntary repayments or prepayments hereunder, in each case as specified in the respective Extension Offer; 
 
(vi)     if the aggregate principal amount of Loans (calculated on the face amount thereof), in respect of which Lenders shall have accepted the relevant Extension Offer shall exceed the maximum aggregate principal amount of Loans offered to be extended by the Borrower pursuant to such Extension Offer, then the Loans of such Lenders shall be extended ratably up to such maximum amount based on the respective principal amounts (but not to exceed actual holdings of record) with respect to which such Lenders have accepted such Extension Offer; 
 
(vii)     all documentation in respect of such Extension shall be consistent with the foregoing, and the covenants and events of default applicable to any Extended Loans shall be substantially identical to, or, taken as a whole, no more favorable to the Lenders providing such Extended Loans than those applicable to the Loans subject to such Extension Offer; 
 
(viii)     the Extended Loans are not secured by any assets or property that does not constitute Collateral, and are not guaranteed by any Subsidiary of Holdings that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor; and
 
(ix)     any applicable Minimum Extension Condition shall be satisfied unless waived by the Borrower.
 

50

 

 
(b)     With respect to all Extensions consummated by the Borrower pursuant to this Section, (i) such Extensions shall not constitute payments or prepayments for purposes of Section 2.03 and (ii) shall be in an integral multiple of $1.0 million and in an aggregate principal amount that is not less than $10.0 million, provided that the Borrower may at its election specify as a condition (a “Minimum Extension Condition”) to consummating any such Extension that a minimum amount (to be determined and specified in the relevant Extension Offer in the Borrower’s sole discretion and which may be waived by the Borrower, but not less than $10.0 million) of Loans of any or all applicable tranches be tendered. The Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereby consent to the transactions contemplated by this Section (including, for the avoidance of doubt, payment of any interest, fees or premium in respect of any Extended Loans on such terms as may be set forth in the relevant Extension Offer (which shall be consistent with the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.13)) and hereby waive the requirements of any provision of this Agreement (including, without limitation, Sections 2.03, 2.11 and 9.01) or any other Loan Document that may otherwise prohibit or conflict with any such Extension or any other transaction contemplated by this Section.
 
(c)     No consent of any Lender or the Administrative Agent shall be required to effectuate any Extension, other than the consent of each Lender agreeing to such Extension with respect to one or more of its Loans (or a portion thereof). All Extended Loans and all obligations in respect thereof shall be Loan Obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents that are secured by the Collateral on a pari passu basis with all other applicable Loan Obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. The Lenders hereby irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent to enter into amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents with the Borrower as may be necessary in order to establish new tranches or sub-tranches in respect of Loans so extended and such technical amendments as may be necessary in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower in connection with the establishment of such new tranches or sub-tranches, in each case on terms consistent with this Section. 
 
(d)     In connection with any Extension, the Borrower shall provide the Administrative Agent at least five (5) Business Days (or such shorter period as may be agreed by the Administrative Agent) prior written notice thereof, and shall agree to such procedures (including, without limitation, regarding timing, rounding and other adjustments and to ensure reasonable administrative management of the Facilities hereunder after such Extension), if any, as may be established by, or acceptable to, the Administrative Agent, in each case acting reasonably to accomplish the purposes of this Section 2.13.
 
SECTION 2.14     Replacement and Refinancing Facilities. 
 
(a)     Replacement of Commitments.
 
(i)     Prior to the Conversion Date, the Borrower may by written notice to Administrative Agent elect to request the establishment of one or more additional revolving facilities providing for revolving commitments (“Replacement Commitments” and the revolving loans thereunder, “Replacement Loans”) which Refinances one or more Classes of Commitments (and corresponding Loans) under this Agreement; provided, that any such Replacement Commitments may not be in an aggregate principal amount greater than the Commitments being refinanced plus unpaid accrued interest, fees, expenses and premium (if any) thereon and underwriting discounts, fees, commissions and expenses in connection with the Replacement Commitments and/or Replacement Loans. Each such notice shall specify the date (each, a “Replacement Effective Date”) on which the Borrower proposes that the Replacement Commitments shall become effective (each such date, the “Replacement Effective Date”), which shall be a date not less than five (5) Business Days after the date on which such notice is delivered to the Administrative Agent; provided that:
 
(A)     no Replacement Commitment shall have a scheduled principal installment payment date or Commitment reduction or termination date prior to the Maturity Date applicable to the Commitments being Refinanced;
 

51

 

 
(B)     other than as provided in Section 2.14(a)(i) above, Replacement Commitments shall have terms and conditions agreed to by the Borrower and the lenders providing such Replacement Commitments, but shall be substantially the same as (or, taken as a whole, no more favorable to, the lenders providing such Replacement Commitments than) those applicable to the Commitments then outstanding, except to the extent such covenants and other terms apply solely to any period after the Latest Maturity Date;
 
(C)     the Loan Parties and the Administrative Agent shall (i) enter into such amendments to the Collateral Documents as may be reasonably requested by the Replacement Lenders (which shall not require any consent from any Lender) in order to ensure that the Replacement Commitments and the Replacement Loans are provided with the benefit of the applicable Collateral Documents on a pari passu basis with the other Obligations and (ii) deliver such other documents and certificates as may be reasonably requested by the Replacement Lenders.
 
(ii)     The Borrower may approach any Lender or any other Person that would be an Eligible Assignee to provide all or a portion of the Replacement Commitments (a “Replacement Lender”); provided that any Lender offered or approached to provide all or a portion of the Replacement Commitments may elect or decline, in its sole discretion, to provide a Replacement Commitment and the selection of Replacement Lenders shall be subject to any consent that would be required pursuant to Section 9.07(b) hereof. Any Replacement Commitment made on any Replacement Effective Date shall be designated a series (a “Replacement Commitment Series”) of Replacement Commitments for all purposes of this Agreement; provided that any Replacement Commitments may, to the extent provided in the applicable Replacement Amendment, be designated as an increase in any previously established Replacement Commitment Series.
 
(iii)     The Replacement Commitments shall be established pursuant to an amendment to this Agreement among Holdings, the Borrower, the Replacement Lenders providing such Replacement Loans (a “Replacement Amendment”) which shall be consistent with the provisions set forth in paragraph (a)(i) above. Each Replacement Amendment shall be binding on the Lenders (including the Replacement Lenders), the Administrative Agent, the Loan Parties party thereto and the other parties hereto. Upon receipt of an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such Replacement Amendment is permitted under the Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent shall be permitted, and is hereby authorized to enter into such amendments with the Borrower to effect the foregoing. Any Replacement Commitment (and the Loans made thereunder) made by a Replacement Lender pursuant to a Replacement Amendment shall be deemed a “Commitment” and “ Loan,” as applicable, for all purposes of this Agreement and each Lender with a Replacement Loan shall become a Lender with respect to such Replacement Loans and all matters relating thereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, at no time shall there be Loans or Commitments (including Replacement Loans, and Replacement Commitments) which have more than five (5) different scheduled final maturity dates or shall there be more than three different “Facilities.”

erests in the Replacement Loans under such Replacement Commitments outstanding immediately prior to such Refinancing as shall be necessary in order that, after giving effect to all such assignments and purchases, the Replacement Loans of such Class will be held by Replacement Lenders thereunder ratably in accordance with their Replacement Percentages. 
 

52

 

 
(v)     In the event that there are any Replacement Loans outstanding on the Conversion Date, such Replacement Loans shall automatically convert to term loans on such date and the Replacement Commitments shall automatically terminate on the Conversion Date. Each such converted Loan shall continue to bear interest at the same rate as, and contain such other terms that are identical to, the Replacement Loan from which it was converted; provided, however that amounts paid or prepaid in respect of the Loans on or after the Conversion Date may not be reborrowed.
 
(b)     Refinancing of Loans.
 
(i)     After the Conversion Date, Borrower may by written notice to the Administrative Agent elect to request the establishment of one or more additional Classes of Loans under this Agreement (“Refinancing Loans”), which refinance, renew, replace, defease or refund (collectively, “Refinance”), in whole or in part, one or more Classes of Loans under this Agreement; provided, that such Refinancing Loans may not be in an amount greater than the Loans being Refinanced plus unpaid accrued interest, fees, expenses and premium (if any) thereon and underwriting discounts, fees, commissions and expenses incurred in connection with the Refinancing Loans. Each such notice shall specify the date (each, a “Refinancing Effective Date”) on which the Borrower proposes that the Refinancing Loans shall be made, which shall be a date not less than five (5) Business Days after the date on which such notice is delivered to the Administrative Agent; provided that:
 
(A)     the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of such Refinancing Term Loans shall not be shorter than the then remaining Weighted Average Life to Maturity of the Class or Classes of Loans being Refinanced and the Refinancing Loans shall not have a final maturity before the Maturity Date of the Loans being Refinanced;
 
(B)     the Refinancing Loans shall have terms and conditions agreed to by the Borrower and the lenders providing such Refinancing Loans, but shall be substantially the same as (or, taken as a whole, no more favorable to, the lenders providing such Refinancing Loans than) those applicable to the then outstanding Loans, except to the extent such covenants and other terms apply solely to any period after the Latest Maturity Date;
 
(C)     the proceeds of any Refinancing Loans shall be applied substantially concurrently with the incurrence thereof to the pro rata prepayment of the Class or Classes of Loans being Refinanced hereunder;
 
(D)     the Refinancing Loan Amendment shall set forth the principal installment payment dates of the Refinancing Loans, which dates may be delayed to later dates than the corresponding scheduled principal installment payment dates of the Loans being refinanced and, in any event, shall be no earlier than the Maturity Date; 
 
(E)     the Loan Parties and the Administrative Agent shall (i) enter into such amendments to the Collateral Documents as may be reasonably requested by the Lenders providing the Refinancing Loans (which shall not require any consent from any Lender) in order to ensure that the Refinancing Loans are provided with the benefit of the applicable Collateral Documents on a pari passu basis with the other Loan Obligations and (ii) deliver such other documents and certificates as may be reasonably requested by the Refinancing Lenders;
 

53

 

 
(F)     the Refinancing Loans will be unsecured or will rank pari passu or junior in respect of Collateral with the other Loans hereunder; and
 
(G)     with respect to any Refinancing Loans made on and after the Conversion Date, but prior to the first anniversary of the Conversion Date, a premium in an amount equal to 1.0% of the aggregate principal amount of the Initial Loans being Refinanced shall be paid to the Lenders holding such Initial Loans.
 
(ii)     The Borrower may approach any Lender or any other Person that would be an Eligible Assignee to provide all or a portion of the Refinancing Loans (a “Refinancing Lender”); provided any Lender offered or approached to provide all or a portion of the Refinancing Loans may elect or decline, in its sole discretion, to provide a Refinancing Loan. Any Refinancing Loans made on any Refinancing Effective Date shall be designated a series (a “Refinancing Term Loan Series”) of Refinancing Loans for all purposes of this Agreement and the selection of Refinancing Lenders shall be subject to any consent that would be required pursuant to Section 9.07(b) hereof; provided that any Refinancing Loans may, to the extent provided in the applicable Refinancing Loan Amendment, be designated as an increase in any previously established Refinancing Loan Series of Refinancing Loans made to the Borrower.
 
(iii)     The Refinancing Loans shall be established pursuant to an amendment to this Agreement among Holdings, the Borrower and the Refinancing Lenders providing such Refinancing Loans (a “Refinancing Loan Amendment”) which shall be consistent with the provisions set forth in paragraph (b)(i) above. Each Refinancing Loan Amendment shall be binding on the Lenders (including the Refinancing Lenders), the Administrative Agent, the Loan Parties party thereto and the other parties hereto. Upon receipt of an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such Refinancing Loan Amendment is permitted under the Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent shall be permitted, and is hereby authorized, to enter into such amendments with the Borrower to effect the foregoing. Any Refinancing Loan made by a Lender pursuant to a Refinancing Loan Amendment shall be deemed a “Loan” for all purposes of this Agreement and each Lender with a Refinancing Loan shall become a Lender with respect to such Refinancing Loans and all matters relating thereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, at no time shall there be Loans (including Refinancing Loans and Extended Loans) which have more than five different scheduled final maturity dates or shall there be more than five different “Facilities”.
 
 
SECTION 2.15     Defaulting Lenders.
 
(a)     Reallocation of Defaulting Lender Commitment, Etc. If a Lender becomes, and during the period it remains, a Defaulting Lender, the following provisions shall apply with respect to such Defaulting Lender:
 
(i)     any amount paid by the Borrower for the account of a Defaulting Lender that was or is a Lender under this Agreement (whether on account of principal, interest, fees, indemnity payments or other amounts) will not be paid or distributed to such Defaulting Lender, but will instead be retained by the Administrative Agent in a segregated non-interest-bearing account until (subject to Section 2.15(c)) the Termination Date and will be applied by the Administrative Agent, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, to the making of payments from time to time in the following order of priority: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent under this Agreement; second, to satisfy the obligations, if any, of such Lender to make Loans to the Borrower; third, to the payment of post-default interest and then current interest due and payable to the Lenders hereunder other than Defaulting Lenders that are Lenders, ratably among them in accordance with the amounts of such interest then due and payable to them; fourth, to the payment of fees then due and payable to the Non-Defaulting Lenders that are Lenders hereunder, ratably among them in accordance with the amounts of such fees then due and payable to them; fifth, to the ratable payment of other amounts then due and payable to the Non-Defaulting Lenders that are Lenders; sixth, on the Termination Date, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and seventh, after the Termination Date, to pay amounts owing under this Agreement to such Defaulting Lender or as a court of competent jurisdiction may otherwise direct.
 

54

 

 
(b)     Fees. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, during such period as a Lender is a Defaulting Lender, such Defaulting Lender will not be entitled to any fees accruing during such period pursuant to Section 2.07 (without prejudice to the rights of the Lenders other than Defaulting Lenders in respect of such fees).
 
(c)     Cure. If the Borrower determines that a Lender that is a Defaulting Lender should no longer be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender, the Borrower will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any amounts then held in the segregated account referred to in Section 2.15(a)), such Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase such portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders and/or make such other adjustments as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the total Commitments pursuant to Section 2.01 of the Lenders to be on a pro rata basis in accordance with their respective Commitments, whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender and will be a Non-Defaulting Lender (and such Commitments and Loans of each Lender will automatically be adjusted on a prospective basis to reflect the foregoing); provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while such Lender was a Defaulting Lender; provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Non-Defaulting Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from such Lender’s having been a Defaulting Lender.

In the event that there are any Loans outstanding on the Conversion Date, such Loans shall automatically convert to term loans on such date and the Initial Commitments shall automatically terminate on the Conversion Date.

ARTICLE III

TAXES, INCREASED COSTS, PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY
 
SECTION 3.01     Taxes.   (a)    Payments Free of Taxes. Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable Law. If any applicable Law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable Withholding Agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a Withholding Agent, then the applicable Withholding Agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 3.01) the applicable Lender or Agent receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made.
 

55

 

 
(b)     Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower. The Loan Parties shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Law, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for, Other Taxes.
 
(c)     Evidence of Payments. As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by any Loan Party to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section 3.01, such Loan Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
 
(d)     Indemnification by the Borrower. The Loan Parties shall jointly and severally indemnify each Lender and each Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 3.01) payable or paid by such Lender or such Agent or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Lender or such Agent and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or Agent (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or other Agent, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
 
(e)     Indemnification by the Lenders. Each Lender shall severally (but not jointly) indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Loan Parties to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 9.07(e) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this paragraph (e).
 
(f)     Status of Lenders. (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable Law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 3.01(f)(ii)(A), (ii)(B)and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.
 

56

 

 
(ii)     Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, 
 
(A)     any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from United States federal backup withholding tax; 
 
(B)     any Non-U.S. Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Non-U.S. Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:

(2)     executed originals of IRS Form W-8ECI;
 
(3)     in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit E-1 to the effect that such Non-U.S. Lender is not a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a “10 percent shareholder” of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a “controlled foreign corporation” described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a “U.S. Tax Certificate”) and (y) executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E; or
 
(4)     to the extent a Non-U.S. Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed originals of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E, a U.S. Tax Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit E-2 or Exhibit E-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Non-U.S. Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Non-U.S. Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Non-U.S. Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit E-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner;
 
(C)     any Non-U.S. Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Non-U.S. Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable Law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in United States federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable Law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and
 
(D)     if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to United States federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by Law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable Law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (D), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
 

58

 

 
Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.
 
(g)     Treatment of Certain Refunds. If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 3.01 (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section 3.01), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section 3.01 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph (g) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental A

ithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (g), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph (g) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person. 
 
(h)     Change of Lending Office. Each Lender agrees that, upon the occurrence of any event giving rise to the operation of Section 3.01(a) or Section 3.01(d) with respect to such Lender, it will, if requested by the Borrower, use reasonable efforts to avoid the consequences of such event, including to designate another Lending Office for any Loan affected by such event or to assign its rights and obligations with respect to such Loan to another of its offices, branches or affiliates; provided that such efforts are made on terms that, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, cause such Lender and its Lending Office(s) to suffer no material economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage; and provided further that nothing in this Section 3.01(h) shall affect or postpone any of the Loan Obligations of any Loan Party or Lender or the rights of the Lender or Loan Party pursuant to this Section 3.01.

59

 

 
SECTION 3.04     Capital Adequacy. 
 
(a)     [Reserved]
 
(b)     If any Lender reasonably determines that the introduction of any Law regarding capital adequacy or liquidity requirements or any change therein or in the interpretation thereof, in each case after the date such Lender becomes a party to this Agreement, or compliance by such Lender (or its Lending Office) therewith, has the effect of reducing the rate of return on the capital of such Lender or any Person controlling such Lender as a consequence of such Lender’s obligations hereunder (taking into consideration its policies with respect to capital adequacy and/or liquidity and such Lender’s desired return on capital), then from time to time upon written demand of such Lender setting forth in reasonable detail the charge and the calculation of such reduced rate of return (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent given in accordance with Section 3.06), the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amounts as will compensate such Lender for such reduction.
 
(c)     [Reserved]
 
(d)     If any Lender requests compensation under this Section 3.04, then such Lender will, if requested by the Borrower, use commercially reasonable efforts to designate another Lending Office for any Loan affected by such event or to assign its rights and obligations with respect to such Loan to another of its offices, branches or affiliates; provided that such efforts are made on terms that, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, cause such Lender and its Lending Office(s) to suffer no material economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage, and provided further that nothing in this Section 3.04(d) shall affect or postpone any of the Loan Obligations of the Borrower or the rights of such Lender pursuant to Section 3.04(b).
 
(e)     Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and all rules, regulations, orders, requests, guidelines or directives in connection therewith or in implementation thereof and (ii) all requests, rules, guidelines, requirements and directives promulgated by the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (or any successor or similar authority) or the United States or foreign regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to Basel III, are, in each case deemed to have been adopted and to have taken effect after the Effective Date.

(a)     Any Agent or any Lender claiming compensation under this Article 3 shall deliver a certificate to the Borrower setting forth in reasonable detail the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder, which shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. In determining such amount, such Agent or such Lender may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods.
 
(b)     With respect to any Lender’s claim for compensation under Section 3.01 or Section 3.04, the Borrower shall not be required to compensate such Lender for any amount incurred more than one hundred and eighty (180) days prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the event that gives rise to such claim and that such Lender has determined to request such compensation; provided that if the circumstance giving rise to such increased cost or reduction is retroactive, then such one hundred eighty (180)-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.

SECTION 6.03     Limitations on Indebtedness. Holdings and the Borrower will not, and will not cause or permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create, incur, assume, become liable for or guarantee the payment of (collectively, an “incurrence”) any Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness); provided that Holdings, the Borrower and any other Loan Party may incur any Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) if, after giving effect thereto and the application of the proceeds therefrom, either (i) the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio on the date thereof would be at least 2.0 to 1.0 or (ii) the ratio of Indebtedness of Holdings and the Restricted Subsidiaries to Consolidated Tangible Net Worth of Holdings is less than 3.0 to 1.0.
 
(b)     Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this Agreement will not prevent the incurrence of:

(c)     For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that an item of Indebtedness may be incurred through Section 6.03(a) or by meeting the criteria of one or more of the types of Indebtedness described in Section 6.03(b) (or the definitions of the terms used therein), Holdings, in its sole discretion,

(d)     Holdings and the Borrower will not, and will not cause or permit any other Loan Party to, directly or indirectly, in any event incur any Indebtedness that purports to be by its terms (or by the terms of any agreement governing such Indebtedness) subordinated to any other Indebtedness of Holdings or of such other Loan Party, as the case may be, unless such Indebtedness is also by its terms (or by the terms of any agreement governing such Indebtedness) made expressly subordinated to the Loans or the Guarantee of such other Loan Party, as the case may be, to the same extent and in the same manner as such Indebtedness is subordinated to such other Indebtedness of Holdings or such other Loan Party, as the case may be.
 
(e)     Accrual of interest or dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount and the payment of interest or dividends in the form of additional Indebtedness will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of this Section. 
 
(f)     For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the incurrence of Indebtedness, the U.S. dollar-equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was incurred, in the case of term debt, or first committed, in the case of revolving credit debt; provided that if such Indebtedness is incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in another currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable U.S. dollar-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such U.S. dollar-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed (i) the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced plus all accrued interest thereon plus (ii) the aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses incurred in connection with such refinancing. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 6.03, the maximum amount of Indebtedness Holdings, the Borrower or a Restricted Subsidiary may incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies.
 
(g)     The principal amount of any Indebtedness incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such respective Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.
 
(h)     For purposes of this Section 6.03 and the other provisions of this Agreement, (i) unsecured Indebtedness shall not be treated as subordinated or junior to secured Indebtedness merely because it is unsecured, and (ii) senior Indebtedness shall not be treated as subordinated or junior to any other senior Indebtedness merely because it has a junior priority with respect to the same collateral.
 

70

 

 
(i)     For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, (i) all Indebtedness outstanding on the Effective Date under the Existing Revolving Credit Agreement shall be deemed to be incurred under clause (a)(iii) of the definition of “Permitted Indebtedness” and (ii) all Existing Unsecured Notes, JV Holdings Secured Group Notes, Existing Secured Notes and all Indebtedness outstanding on the Effective Date under the Senior Secured Super Priority Term Loan Credit Agreement shall be deemed to be incurred under clause (c) of the definition of “Permitted Indebtedness”.
 
SECTION 6.04     Limitations on Restricted Payments. (a) Holdings and the Borrower will not, and will not cause or permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, make any Restricted Payment unless:
 
(i)     no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of or immediately after giving effect to such Restricted Payment;
 
(ii)     immediately after giving effect to such Restricted Payment, Holdings could incur at least $1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to Section 6.03(a) hereof; and
 
(iii)     immediately after giving effect to such Restricted Payment, the aggregate amount of all Restricted Payments (including the Fair Market Value of any non-cash Restricted Payment) declared or made on or after the Effective Date does not exceed the sum of:
 
(A)     $16.0 million, plus
 
(B)     50% of the Consolidated Net Income of Holdings on a cumulative basis during the period (taken as one accounting period) from and including February 1, 2018 and ending on the last day of Holdings’ fiscal quarter immediately preceding the date of such Restricted Payment (or in the event such Consolidated Net Income shall be a deficit, minus 100% of such deficit), plus
 
(C)     100% of the aggregate net cash proceeds of and the Fair Market Value of Property received by Holdings from (1) any capital contribution to Holdings after Effective Date or any issue or sale after the Effective Date of Qualified Stock (other than (i) to any Subsidiary of Holdings or (ii) any Excluded Contribution) and (2) the issue or sale on or after the Effective Date of any Indebtedness or other securities of Holdings or the Borrower convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for Qualified Stock of Holdings that have been so converted, exchanged or exercised, as the case may be, plus
 
(D)     in the case of the disposition or repayment of any Investment constituting a Restricted Payment (or if the Investment was made prior to the Effective Date, that would have constituted a Restricted Payment if made after the Effective Date, if such disposition or repayment results in cash received by Holdings, the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary), an amount (to the extent not included in the calculation of Consolidated Net Income referred to in (B)) equal to the return of capital with respect to such Investment, including by dividend, distribution or sale of Capital Stock (to the extent not included in the calculation of Consolidated Net Income referred to in (B)), plus
 
(E)     with respect to any Unrestricted Subsidiary that is redesignated as a Restricted Subsidiary after the Effective Date, in accordance with the definition of “Unrestricted Subsidiary” (so long as the designation of such Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary was treated under the Exchange Notes Indenture or this Agreement as a Restricted Payment made after the Effective Date, and only to the extent not included in the calculation of Consolidated Net Income referred to in (B)), an amount equal to the lesser of (x) the proportionate interest of Holdings or a Restricted Subsidiary in an amount equal to the excess of (I) the total assets of such Subsidiary, valued on an aggregate basis at the lesser of book value and Fair Market Value thereof, over (II) the total liabilities of such Subsidiary, determined in accordance with GAAP, and (y) the Designation Amount at the time of such Subsidiary’s designation as an Unrestricted Subsidiary.

provided, however, that each Restricted Payment described in clauses (i) and (ii) of this Section 6.04(b) shall be taken into account for purposes of computing the aggregate amount of all Restricted Payments pursuant to clause (iii) of Section 6.04(a).
 
(c)     For purposes of determining the aggregate and permitted amounts of Restricted Payments made, the amount of any guarantee of any Investment in any Person that was initially treated as a Restricted Payment and which was subsequently terminated or expired, net of any amounts paid by Holdings or any Restricted Subsidiary in respect of such guarantee, shall be deducted.
 
(d)     In determining the “Fair Market Value” for purposes of clause (iii) of Section 6.04(a), Property other than cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities shall be deemed to be equal in value to the “equity value” of the Capital Stock or other securities issued in exchange therefor. The equity value of such Capital Stock or other securities shall be equal to (i) the number of shares of Common Equity issued in the transaction (or issuable upon conversion or exercise of the Capital Stock or other securities issued in the transaction) multiplied by the closing sale price of the Common Equity on its principal market on the date of the transaction (less, in the case of Capital Stock or other securities which require the payment of consideration at the time of conversion or exercise, the aggregate consideration payable thereupon) or (ii) if the Common Equity is not then traded on a national securities exchange, or if the Capital Stock or other securities issued in the transaction do not consist of Common Equity (or Capital Stock or other securities convertible into or exercisable for Common Equity), the value (if more than $10.0 million) of such Capital Stock or other securities as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of Holdings.

SECTION 6.05     Limitations on Liens. Holdings and the Borrower will not, and will not cause or permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Liens that secure obligations under any Indebtedness, other than Permitted Liens, on any of its Property, including any shares of Capital Stock or Indebtedness of any Person owned by the Borrower or such Loan Party.

(iii)     encumbrances or restrictions under any agreement or other instrument of a Person acquired by or merged or consolidated with or into Holdings or any Restricted Subsidiary, or of an Unrestricted Subsidiary that is designated a Restricted Subsidiary, or that is assumed in connection with the acquisition of assets from such Person, in each case that is in existence at the time of such transaction (but not created in contemplation thereof), which encumbrance or restriction is not applicable to any Person, or the properties or assets of any Person, other than the Person and its Subsidiaries, or the property or assets of the Person and its Subsidiaries, so acquired or designated,

(v)     any Permitted Lien, or any other agreement restricting the sale or other disposition of property, securing Indebtedness permitted by this Agreement if such Permitted Lien or agreement does not expressly restrict the ability of a Subsidiary of Holdings to pay dividends or make or repay loans or advances prior to default thereunder,
 
(vi)     reasonable and customary borrowing base covenants set forth in agreements evidencing Indebtedness otherwise permitted by this Agreement,
 
(vii)     customary non-assignment provisions in leases, licenses, encumbrances, contracts or similar assets entered into or acquired in the ordinary course of business,

(xvi)     any encumbrances or restrictions that require “lockbox” or similar obligations with respect to Non-Recourse Indebtedness,
 
(xvii)     any encumbrances or restrictions of the type referred to in clauses (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 6.06 imposed by any amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings of the contracts, instruments or obligations referred to in clauses (i) and (iii) through (xvi) of this Section 6.06; provided, that such amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings are, in the good faith judgment of Holdings’ Board of Directors or its chief executive officer or chief financial officer, not materially more restrictive with respect to such encumbrances or restrictions than those contained in the encumbrance or restrictions prior to such amendment, modification, restatement, renewal, supplement, refunding, replacement or refinancing, and
 
(xviii)     any encumbrance or restriction under other Indebtedness of Restricted Subsidiaries permitted to be incurred subsequent to the Closing Date pursuant to Section 6.03; provided, that such encumbrances or restrictions will not materially affect the Borrower’s ability to make anticipated principal and interest payments on the Loans, as determined in the good faith judgment of Holdings’ Board of Directors or its chief executive officer or chief financial officer.

(B)     the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio would be equal to or greater than the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio immediately prior to such transaction or the ratio of Indebtedness of Holdings and the Restricted Subsidiaries to Consolidated Tangible Net Worth of Holdings would be equal to or less than the ratio immediately prior to such transaction.
 
The foregoing provisions shall not apply to: (1) a transaction involving the sale or disposition of Capital Stock of a Guarantor, or the consolidation or merger of a Guarantor, or the sale, lease, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of a Guarantor, that in any such case results in such Guarantor being released from its Guarantee, or (2) a transaction the purpose of which is to change the state of incorporation or formation of Holdings, the Borrower or any other Loan Party.
 
SECTION 6.12     Reports to Lenders.  (b) Holdings shall file with the Commission the annual reports and the information, documents and other reports required to be filed pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. Holdings shall file with the Administrative Agent and deliver to each Lender such reports, information and documents within 15 days after it files them with the Commission. In the event that Holdings is no longer subject to these periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, it will nonetheless continue to file reports with the Commission and the Administrative Agent and deliver such reports to each Lender as if it were subject to such reporting requirements. Regardless of whether Holdings is required to furnish such reports to its stockholders pursuant to the Exchange Act, Holdings will cause its consolidated financial statements and a “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition” written report, similar to those that would have been required to appear in annual or quarterly reports, to be delivered to each Lender.
 
(c)     The posting of the reports, information and documents referred to above on Holdings’ website or one maintained on its behalf for such purpose shall be deemed to satisfy Holdings’ delivery obligations to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders. In addition, availability of the foregoing materials on the Commission’s EDGAR service shall be deemed to satisfy Holdings’ delivery obligations to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall have no obligation to monitor whether Holdings posts such reports, information and documents on its website or the Commission’s EDGAR service, or collect any such information from Holdings’ website or the Commission’s EDGAR service.

(d)     Delivery of such reports, information and documents to the Administrative Agent is for informational purposes only and the Administrative Agent’s receipt of them will not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable from information contained therein, including the Borrower’s and/or Holdings’ compliance with any of its covenants in this Agreement (as to which the Administrative Agent is entitled to rely exclusively on Officers’ Certificates).
 
SECTION 6.13     Notice of Other Defaults In the event that any Indebtedness that has an outstanding principal amount of $40.0 million or more of the Borrower or any other Loan Party is declared due and payable before its maturity because of the occurrence of any default under such Indebtedness, the Borrower or the relevant Loan Party, as the case may be, shall promptly deliver to the Administrative Agent an Officers’ Certificate stating such declaration; provided, that the term “Indebtedness” as used in this Section 6.13 shall not include Non-Recourse Indebtedness. 
 
SECTION 6.14     Collateral Requirement; Further Assurances; Costs.
 
(a)     On the Closing Date, the Borrower and each other Loan Party shall grant Liens on their property (other than Excluded Property) and take all appropriate steps to cause such Liens to be perfected first-priority liens (subject to Permitted Liens), including through, filing of UCC-1 financing statements or otherwise, pursuant to, and to the extent required by, the Collateral Documents to be entered into on the Closing Date and this Agreement; provided that the recordation of mortgages and entry into control agreements will occur after the Closing Date in such time periods as set forth in Section 6.14(c) or such longer time period as reasonably agreed to by the Required Lenders.

(b)     If the Borrower or any other Loan Party at any time after the Closing Date acquires any new property (other than Excluded Property) that is not automatically subject to a Lien under the Collateral Documents, or a non-Loan Party Restricted Subsidiary becomes a Loan Party, the Borrower will, or will cause such other Loan Party, subject to the requirements of the Collateral Documents, to as soon as practical after such property’s acquisition or it no longer being Excluded Property (subject to Section 6.14(d) below):
 
(i)     grant a first-priority Lien on such Collateral (or, in the case of a new Loan Party, all of its assets except Excluded Property) to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties and, to the extent such grant would require the execution and delivery of a Collateral Document, the Borrower or such other Loan Party shall execute and deliver a Collateral Document on substantially the same terms as the Collateral Documents executed and delivered on the Closing Date);
 
(ii)     cause the Lien granted in such Collateral Document to be duly perfected in any manner permitted by law to the same extent as the Liens granted on the Closing Date are perfected; and
 
(iii)     instruct the Administrative Agent in writing to take all action necessary in connection with the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.14(b) including as necessary under the Collateral Documents and determining whether Collateral constitutes Mortgage Tax Collateral (as defined in the Amended and Restated Intercreditor Agreement) for purposes of the Amended and Restated Intercreditor Agreements. By their making of the Loans, the Lenders shall be deemed to have instructed and authorized the Administrative Agent to take such actions as instructed by Holdings or the Borrower or any other Guarantor.

(iii)     [Reserved]; 
 
(iv)     any control, intercreditor or similar agreements or other Collateral Documents required pursuant to this Agreement or the Collateral Documents with respect to L/C Collateral (other than Excluded Property) may provide that the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties has a security interest in such Collateral that is junior to the lien granted to the holders of the obligations secured by such L/C Collateral; 
 
(v)     in the case of personal property, the Borrower and the other Loan Parties will not be required to take any steps to perfect liens on personal property outside the United States; and

(e)     Neither the Borrower nor any of the other Loan Parties will be permitted to take any action, or knowingly or negligently omit to take any action, which action or omission might or would have the result of materially impairing the security interest with respect to the Collateral for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Secured Parties.
 
(f)     On the Closing Date, Holdings is required to deliver to the Administrative Agent, a Perfection Certificate.
 
SECTION 6.15     Maintenance of Ratings. The Borrower shall use commercially reasonable efforts to, not later than sixty (60) days after the Conversion Date (or such later date as may be agreed to by the Required Lenders), obtain and, thereafter maintain, (i) a public corporate credit rating (but not any particular rating) from S&P and a public corporate family rating (but not any particular rating) from Moody’s, in each case in respect of the Borrower or Holdings and (ii) a public rating (but not any particular rating) in respect of the Loans from each of S&P and Moody’s.
 
SECTION 6.16     Change of Control Offers.
 
(a)     Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, each Lender shall have the right, at such Lender’s option, to require the Borrower to purchase (the “Change of Control Offer”) all or any part of such Lender’s Loans and terminate such Lender’s Term Commitments on a date (the “Change of Control Repurchase Date”) that is no later than 90 days after notice of the Change of Control, with such purchase of Loans being at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Loans held by such Lender plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the Change of Control Repurchase Date.
 
(b)     On or before the thirtieth day after any Change of Control, the Borrower shall provide written notice to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, regarding the Change of Control and the repurchase right. The notice shall state the Change of Control Repurchase Date, the date by which the purchase right must be exercised, the price for the Loans and the procedure which the Lender must follow to exercise such right. To exercise such right, a Lender must deliver, at least ten days prior to the Change of Control Repurchase Date, written notice to the Borrower of the Lender’s exercise of such right; provided, however, that if mandated by applicable Law, a Lender may be permitted to deliver such written notice nearer to the Change of Control Repurchase Date than may be specified by the Borrower. 
 
(c)     Notices may be delivered prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control stating that the Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control, and, if applicable, shall state that, in the Borrower’s discretion, the Change of Control Repurchase Date may be delayed until such time as the Change of Control shall occur, or that such repurchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that the Borrower shall determine that such condition will not be satisfied by the Change of Control Repurchase Date, or by the Change of Control Repurchase Date as so delayed.
 
(d)     The Borrower will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in this Section 6.16 and purchases all such Loans validly tendered for purchase and not validly withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer.
 

83

 

 
(e)     If Lenders holding not less than 90% of the sum of the Total Outstandings and unused Term Commitments then outstanding and which have not terminated pursuant to Section 2.04 validly tender and do not validly withdraw such Loans and Term Commitments in the Change of Control Offer and the Borrower, or any third party making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Borrower as permitted by this Section 6.16, purchases of all of the Loans validly tendered and not validly withdrawn by such Lenders, the Borrower or such third party shall have the right, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice to the Lenders (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described in this Section 6.16, to purchase all Loans that remain outstanding following such repurchase at a price in cash equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of repurchase, and to terminate all Term Commitments.
 
SECTION 6.17     Maintenance of Properties. Each of Holdings and the Borrower will, and will cause each Loan Party to, keep and maintain all tangible property material to the conduct of its business in good working order and condition (subject to casualty, condemnation and ordinary wear and tear), except where the failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.
 
SECTION 6.18     Insurance.
 
(a)     At any time on and after the Closing Date, each of Holdings and the Borrower will, and will cause each Loan Party to, maintain, with insurance companies that Holdings believes (in the good faith judgment of the management of Holdings) are financially sound and responsible at the time the relevant coverage is placed or renewed, insurance in at least such amounts (after giving effect to any self-insurance which Holdings believes (in the good faith judgment of management of Holdings) is reasonable and prudent in light of the size and nature of its business) and against at least such risks (and with such risk retentions) as Holdings believes (in the good faith judgment or the management of Holdings) are reasonable and prudent in light of the size and nature of its business, and will furnish to the Lenders, upon written request from the Administrative Agent (acting at the direction of the Required Lenders), information presented in reasonable detail as to the insurance so carried. Each such general liability policy of insurance shall (i) name the Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Secured Parties, as an additional insured thereunder as its interests may appear and (ii) in the case of each casualty insurance policy, contain a loss payable clause or mortgagee endorsement that names the Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Lenders as the loss payee or mortgagee thereunder.
 
(b)     If any portion of any Collateral upon which a “Building” (as defined in 12 CFR Chapter III, Section 339.2) is at any time located is situated in an area identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (or any successor agency) as a special flood hazard area with respect to which flood insurance has been made available under the Flood Insurance Laws, then the Borrower shall, or shall cause each Loan Party to (i) maintain, or cause to be maintained, with a financially sound and reputable insurer, flood insurance in an amount and otherwise sufficient to comply with all applicable rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to the Flood Insurance Laws and (ii) furnish to the Lenders, upon written request from the Administrative Agent, evidence of such compliance in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent, including, without limitation evidence of annual renewals of such insurance.

(A)     is for relief against Holdings, the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Significant Subsidiary as debtor in an involuntary case,
 
(B)     appoints a Custodian of Holdings, the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Significant Subsidiary or a Custodian for all or substantially all of the property of Holdings or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Significant Subsidiary, or
 
(C)     orders the liquidation of Holdings, the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Significant Subsidiary, 
 
and the order or decree remains unstayed and in effect for 60 days;
 
(ix)     any Guarantee of a Loan Party that is a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of such Guarantee and this Agreement) or is declared null and void and unenforceable or found to be invalid or Holdings or any Subsidiary Guarantor denies its liability under its Guarantee (other than by reason of release of such Loan Party from its Guarantee in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and such Guarantee);
 
(x)     the Liens created by the Collateral Documents shall at any time not constitute valid and perfected Liens on any material portion of the Collateral intended to be covered thereby (to the extent perfection by filing, registration, recordation or possession is required by this Agreement or the Collateral Documents) other than in accordance with the terms of the relevant Collateral Document and this Agreement and other than the satisfaction in full of all Loan Obligations under this Agreement or the release or amendment of any such Lien in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or the Collateral Documents, or, except for expiration in accordance with its terms or amendment, modification, waiver, termination or release in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the relevant Collateral Document, any of the Collateral Documents shall for whatever reason be terminated or cease to be in full force and effect, if in either case, such default continues for 30 days after notice, or the enforceability thereof shall be contested by the Borrower or any other Loan Party

A Default as described in subclause (iii) of this Section 7.01 will not be deemed an Event of Default until the Lenders of at least 25 percent in principal amount of the then outstanding Loans notify Holdings and the Administrative Agent, of the Default and (except in the case of a Default with respect to Section 6.11 hereof) Holdings does not cure the Default within 60 days after receipt of the notice. The notice must specify the Default, demand that it be remedied and state that the notice is a “Notice of Default.” If such a Default is cured within such time period, it ceases to be a Default.
 

86

 

 
If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default with respect to Holdings or the Borrower resulting from subclauses (vii) or (viii) of this Section 7.01), shall have occurred and be continuing under this Agreement, the Administrative Agent by notice to Holdings, or the Required Lenders by notice to Holdings and the Administrative Agent, may declare all Loans to be due and payable immediately. Upon such declaration of acceleration, the amounts due and payable on the Loans and all other Loan Obligations will be due and payable immediately. If an Event of Default specified in subclauses (iv) or (v) of this Section 7.01 occurs, the declaration of acceleration of the amounts due and payable on the Loans and all other Loan Obligations shall be automatically annulled if the default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to subclauses (iv) or (v) of this Section 7.01 shall be remedied or cured by Holdings, the Borrower or a Restricted Subsidiary or waived by the holders of the relevant Indebtedness within 20 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if (1) the annulment of the acceleration of the amounts due and payable on the Loans would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all existing Events of Default, except nonpayment of principal, premium, if any, or interest on the Loans that became due solely because of the acceleration of the amounts due and payable on the Loans, have been cured or waived. The Borrower shall provide the Administrative Agent with notice of any such annulment of a declaration of acceleration of the Loans. If an Event of Default with respect to Holdings or the Borrower specified in subclauses (vii) or (viii) of this Section 7.01 occurs, such an amount will ipso facto become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration, notice or other act on the part of the Administrative Agent and Holdings or any Lender. This provision, however, is subject to the condition that, if at any time after the unpaid principal amount (or such specified amount) of the Loans shall have been so declared due and payable and before any judgment or decree for the payment of the moneys due shall have been obtained or entered as hereinafter provided, the Borrower shall pay or shall deposit with the Administrative Agent a sum sufficient to pay all matured installments of interest, if any, upon all of the Loans and the principal of all the Loans, which shall have become due otherwise than by acceleration (with interest on overdue installments of interest, if any, to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable Law and on such principal at the rate borne by the Loans to the date of such payment or deposit) and the reasonable compensation, disbursements, expenses and advances of the Administrative Agent (including, but not limited to, fees, expenses and disbursements of legal counsel) and all other amounts due to the Administrative Agent under Section 2.07 and Section 8.12 and any and all defaults under this Agreement, other than the nonpayment of such portion of the principal amount of and accrued interest, if any, on Loans which shall have become due by acceleration, shall have been cured or shall have been waived in accordance with Section 9.01 or provision deemed by the Administrative Agent to be adequate shall have been made therefor, then and in every such case the Required Lenders, by written notice to the Borrower and to the Administrative Agent, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences; but no such rescission and annulment shall extend to or shall affect any subsequent default, or shall impair any right consequent thereon. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, no waiver shall be effective against any Lender for any Event of Default or event which with notice or lapse of time or both would be an Event of Default with respect to any covenant or provision which cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Lender of each outstanding Loan affected thereby, unless all such affected Lenders agree, in writing, to waive such Event of Default or other event.
 
If the Administrative Agent shall have proceeded to enforce any right under this Agreement and such proceedings shall have been discontinued or abandoned because of such rescission or annulment or for any reason or shall have been determined to be adverse to the Administrative Agent, then and in every such case the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall be restored respectively to their several positions and rights hereunder, and all rights, remedies and powers of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall continue as though no such proceeding had been taken.
 

87

 

 
Except with respect to an Event of Default pursuant to clauses (i) or (ii) of this Section 7.01, the Administrative Agent shall not be charged with knowledge of any Event of Default unless written notice thereof shall have been given to a Responsible Officer of the Administrative Agent by the Borrower or any Lender and such notice references the Loans and this Agreement.
 
SECTION 7.02     [Reserved].
 
SECTION 7.03     Application of Funds. After the exercise of remedies provided for in Section 7.02 (or after the Loans have automatically become immediately due and payable and the Commitments have automatically terminated as set forth in the proviso to Section 7.02), any amounts received on account of the Loan Obligations shall be applied by the Administrative Agent in the following order:
 
First, to payment of that portion of the Loan Obligations constituting fees, indemnities, expenses and other amounts (including amounts payable under Article 3, but not including principal of or interest on any Loan) payable to the Administrative Agent in its capacity as such;
 
Second, to payment of that portion of the Loan Obligations constituting fees, indemnities and other amounts (other than principal and interest) payable to the Lenders (including amounts payable under Article 3), ratably among them in proportion to the amounts described in this clause Second payable to them;
 
Third, to payment of that portion of the Loan Obligations constituting accrued and unpaid interest on the Loans, ratably among the Lenders in proportion to the respective amounts described in this clause Third payable to them;
 
Fourth, to payment of that portion of the Loan Obligations constituting unpaid principal of the Loans;
 
Fifth, to the payment of all other Loan Obligations of the Loan Parties that are due and payable to the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties on such date, ratably based upon the respective aggregate amounts of all such Loan Obligations owing to the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties on such date; and
 
Last, the balance, if any, after all of the Loan Obligations have been paid in full, to the Borrower or as otherwise required by Law.
 
ARTICLE VIII

ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND OTHER AGENTS
 
SECTION 8.01     Appointment and Authority. 
 
(a)     Each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably appoints Wilmington Trust, National Association to act on its behalf as the Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers, rights and remedies as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. In performing its functions and duties hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall act solely as an agent of the Lenders and does not assume and shall not be deemed to have assumed any obligation towards or relationship of agency or trust with or for Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries.
 

88

 

 
(b)     The Administrative Agent shall also act as the “collateral agent” under the Loan Documents, and each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent to act as the agent of (and to hold any security interest created by the Collateral Documents for and on behalf of or on trust for) such Agent or Lender (i) for purposes of the perfection of all Liens created by the Loan Documents and all other purposes stated therein, (ii) to manage, supervise and otherwise deal with the Collateral, (iii) to take such other action as is necessary or desirable to maintain the perfection and priority of the Liens created or purported to be created by the Loan Documents and (iv) except as may be otherwise specified in any Loan Document, to exercise all remedies given to the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties with respect to the Collateral, whether under the Loan Documents, applicable Law or otherwise, in each case, together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto. In this connection, the Administrative Agent, as “collateral agent” (and any sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 8.05 for purposes of holding or enforcing any Lien on the Collateral (or any portion thereof) granted under the Collateral Documents, or for exercising any rights and remedies thereunder at the direction of the Administrative Agent), shall be entitled to the benefits of all provisions of this Article 8 and Section 8.05 as though such sub-agents were the “collateral agent” under the Loan Documents and as if the term Administrative Agent included the “collateral agent” as if set forth in full herein with respect thereto.
 
(c)     Each Lender irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent to enter into any and all of the Collateral Documents together with such other documents as shall be necessary to give effect to the Lien on the Collateral contemplated by the other Collateral Documents, on its behalf. The Administrative Agent shall have only those duties and responsibilities that are expressly specified herein and the other Loan Documents to which it is a party. The Administrative Agent may exercise such powers, rights and remedies and perform such duties by or through its agents or employees. The Administrative Agent’s duties hereunder shall be entirely administrative in nature. The Administrative Agent (i) is not assuming any obligation under any Loan Document other than as expressly set forth therein and (ii) shall not have implied functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or other liabilities under any Loan Document, and each Lender hereby waives and agrees not to assert any claim against the Administrative Agent based on the roles, duties and legal relationships expressly disclaimed in this or the immediately preceding sentence or in Section 8.03. The Administrative Agent shall not have, by reason hereof or any of the other Loan Documents, a fiduciary relationship in respect of any Lender; and nothing herein or any of the Loan Documents, expressed or implied, is intended to or shall be so construed as to impose upon the Administrative Agent any obligations in respect hereof or any of the other Loan Documents except as expressly set forth herein or therein. Any action taken by the Administrative Agent in reliance upon the instructions of the Required Lenders (or, where so required by Section 9.01, such greater proportion of Lenders) and the exercise by the Administrative Agent of the powers set forth herein or in the other Loan Documents, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto, shall be authorized and binding upon all of the Secured Parties.
 
SECTION 8.02     Rights as a Lender. The agency hereby created shall in no way impair or affect any of the rights and powers of, or impose any duties or obligations upon, the Administrative Agent in its individual capacity as a Lender hereunder. The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall, if it is a Lender, have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent and the term “Lender” or “Lenders” shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, own securities of, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust or other business with Holdings or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and may accept fees and other consideration from the Borrower for services in connection herewith and otherwise without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders. The Lenders acknowledge that pursuant to such activities, the Administrative Agent and its Related Parties may receive information regarding any Loan Party or any Affiliate of any Loan Party (including information that may be subject to confidentiality obligations in favor of such Loan Party or such Affiliate) and acknowledge that the Administrative Agent and its Related Parties shall be under no obligation to provide such information to them.
 

89

(a)     shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied (or express) duties or obligations arising under the agency doctrine of any applicable Law or otherwise, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing;
 
(b)     notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action (or omit to take any action) that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable Laws or if the Administrative Agent is not indemnified to its satisfaction; and
 
(c)     shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as the Administrative Agent or any Agent-Related Person in any capacity.
 
The Administrative Agent and the Agent-Related Persons shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it or them (i)(A) under or in connection with any of the Loan Documents or (B) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances provided in Section 7.02 and 9.01) or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence, or willful misconduct; provided, that the Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default or Event of Default unless and until notice describing such Default or Event of Default and stating it is a “notice of default” is given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower or a Lender; provided, further, that in the event the Administrative Agent shall receive such a notice, the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Lenders; it being understood that the failure to give such notice shall not result in any liability on the part of the Administrative Agent.
 
The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default, (iv) the execution, validity, enforceability, effectiveness, genuineness, collectability or sufficiency of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document or the creation, perfection or priority of any Lien purported to be created by the Loan Documents, (v) the value or the sufficiency of any Collateral, (vi) the financial condition or business affairs of any Loan Party or any other Person liable for the payment of any Loan Obligations or as to the use of the proceeds of the Loans, (vii) the properties, books or records of any Loan Party, (viii) the existence or possible existence of any Event of Default or Default or (ix) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article 4 or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.

The Administrative Agent shall not have any liability arising from confirmations of the amount of outstanding Loans or the component amounts thereof.
 
Administrative Agent shall not be required to exercise any discretion or take, or to omit to take, any action, including with respect to enforcement or collection unless Administrative Agent has received satisfactory instructions from the Required Lenders (or, where expressly required by the terms of this Agreement, a greater proportion of the Lenders, it being understood, however, that with regards to enforcement actions following an Event of Default, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to act upon the direction of the Required Lenders), and, if necessary in the Administrative Agent’s opinion, satisfactory indemnity and security. Phrases such as “satisfactory to the Administrative Agent,” “approved by the Administrative Agent,” “acceptable to the Administrative Agent,” “as determined by the Administrative Agent,” “in the Administrative Agent’s discretion,” “selected by the Administrative Agent,” and phrases of similar import authorize and permit the Administrative Agent to approve, disapprove, determine, act or decline to act in its discretion, it being understood that the Administrative Agent in exercising such discretion under the Loan Documents shall be acting on the instructions of the Required Lenders (or Lenders to the extent required hereunder) and shall be fully protected in, and shall incur no liability in connection with, acting or failing to act (or failing to act while awaiting such direction) pursuant to such instructions. 
 
The Administrative Agent shall never be required to use, risk or advance its own funds or otherwise incur financial liability in the performance of any of its duties or the exercise of any of its rights and powers hereunder (including, but not limited to, no obligation to grant any credit extension or to make any advance hereunder).

Such acts shall include but not be limited to acts of God, strikes, lockouts, riots, acts of war, epidemics, governmental regulations superimposed after the fact, fire, communication line failures, computer viruses, power failures, earthquakes, terrorist attacks or other disasters.
 
The permissive authorizations, entitlements, powers and rights (including the right to request that the Borrower take an action or deliver a document and the exercise of remedies following an Event of Default) granted to the Administrative Agent herein shall not be construed as duties. The Administrative Agent shall have no responsibility for interest or income on any funds held by it hereunder and any funds so held shall be held un-invested pending distribution thereof.
 
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to (i) file or prepare any financing or continuation statements or record any documents or instruments in any public office for purposes of creating, perfecting or maintaining any Lien or security interest created under the Loan Documents; (ii) take any necessary steps to preserve rights against any parties with respect to any Collateral; or (iii) take any action to protect against any diminution in value of the Collateral.

SECTION 8.04     Reliance by Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender prior to the making of such Loan. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants, experts or professional advisors. No Lender shall have any right of action whatsoever against the Administrative Agent as a result of the Administrative Agent acting or refraining from acting hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents in accordance with the instructions of Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents). If at any time the Administrative Agent is served with any judicial or administrative order, judgment, decree, writ or other form of judicial or administrative process which in any way affects the Collateral (including, but not limited to, orders of attachment or garnishment or other forms of levies or injunctions or stays relating to the transfer of the Collateral), the Administrative Agent is authorized to comply therewith in any manner as it or its legal counsel of its own choosing deems appropriate; and if the Administrative Agent complies with any such judicial or administrative order, judgment, decree, writ or other form of judicial or administrative process, the Administrative Agent shall not be liable to any of the parties hereto or to any other person or entity even though such order, judgment, decree, writ or process may be subsequently modified or vacated or otherwise determined to have been without legal force or effect.
 
SECTION 8.05     Delegation of Duties. The Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent and shall not be responsible for the acts of any such party appointed with due care. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory, indemnification and other provisions of this Article 8 shall apply to any such sub-agent and its Related Parties and to the Agent-Related Persons in any role or capacity, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent. All of the rights, benefits and privileges (including the exculpatory and indemnification provisions) of this Article 8 shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities as sub-agent as if such sub-agent and Related Parties were named herein. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, with respect to each sub-agent appointed by the Administrative Agent, (i) such sub-agent shall be a third party beneficiary under this Agreement with respect to all such rights, benefits and privileges (including exculpatory rights and rights to indemnification) and shall have all of the rights and benefits of a third party beneficiary, including an independent right of action to enforce such rights, benefits and privileges (including exculpatory rights and rights to indemnification) directly, without the consent or joinder of any other Person, against any or all of the Loan Parties and the Lenders, (ii) such rights, benefits and privileges (including exculpatory rights and rights to indemnification) shall not be modified or amended without the consent of such sub-agent and (iii) such sub-agent shall only have obligations to the Administrative Agent and not to any Loan Party, Lender or any other Person and no Loan Party, Lender or other Person shall have any rights, directly or indirectly, as a third party beneficiary or otherwise against such sub-agent.

SECTION 8.06     Resignation of Administrative Agent: Appointment of Successor. The Administrative Agent may at any time resign or, if it is a Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (iv) of the definition thereof, be removed by the Borrower upon ten (10) days’ prior written notice of such resignation or removal to the Lenders and the Borrower. Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation or removal, the Required Lenders shall have the right, with the consent of the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed and provided that no consent of the Borrower shall be required if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing), to appoint a successor Administrative Agent which shall be a commercial bank or trust company with offices in the U.S. having combined capital and surplus in excess of $100,000,000. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days after notice of the Administrative Agent’s resignation or removal, then, (i) in the case of a resignation of the Administrative Agent, the resigning Administrative Agent with the consent of the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, or delayed; provided that no consent of the Borrower shall be required if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing) or (ii) in the case of a removal of the Administrative Agent, the Borrower, may, with the consent of the Required Lenders, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent; provided that if no qualifying Person has accepted such appointment, then such resignation or removal shall nonetheless become effective after such thirty-day period and (1) the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (except that in the case of any possessory Collateral held by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders the retiring Administrative Agent shall continue to hold such Collateral until such time as a successor Administrative Agent is appointed) and (2) all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender directly (and each Lender will cooperate with the Borrower to enable the Borrower to take such actions), until such time as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided for above in this paragraph. Upon the acceptance of a successor’s appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or retired) or removed Administrative Agent, and the retiring (or retired) or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this paragraph) other than its obligations under Section 9.08. The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After the resignation or removal of the Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article 8 and Section 9.05 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring or removed Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring or removed Administrative Agent was acting as the Administrative Agent.
 
SECTION 8.07     Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Lenders. Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement, made its own independent investigation of the financial condition and affairs of Holdings and its Subsidiaries in connection with Borrowings hereunder, and made and shall continue to make its own appraisal of the creditworthiness of Holdings and its Subsidiaries. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder. The Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility, either initially or on a continuing basis, or otherwise, to make any such investigation or any such appraisal on behalf of the Lenders or to provide any Lender with any credit or other information with respect thereto, whether coming into its possession before the making of the Loans or at any time or times thereafter, and the Administrative Agent shall not have any responsibility with respect to the accuracy or completeness of any information provided to the Lenders. Except for documents expressly required by this Agreement to be transmitted by the Administrative Agent to the Lenders, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Secured Party with any credit or other information concerning the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition or creditworthiness of any Loan Party or any Affiliate of any Loan Party that may come in to the possession of the Administrative Agent or any of its Related Parties.

SECTION 8.08     Collateral and Guarantee Matters. The Lenders irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent to, and the Administrative Agent shall:
 
(a)     release any Lien on any property granted to or held by the Administrative Agent under any Loan Document (i) on the date upon which all of the Loan Obligations (other than contingent obligations not yet accrued and payable) have been paid in full in cash, the Aggregate Commitments have expired or have been terminated (such date, the “Termination Date”), (ii) with respect to any property constituting Collateral that (x) is sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of by the Borrower, Holdings or any other Loan Party to any Person other than a Loan Party (but excluding any transaction where the recipient is required to become a Loan Party) in a transaction permitted by this Agreement and the Collateral Documents, at the time of such sale or disposition, to the extent of the interest sold or disposed of or (y) is owned or at any time acquired by a Restricted Subsidiary that has been released from its Guarantee, concurrently with the release of such Guarantee, (iii) subject to Section 9.01, if approved, authorized or ratified in writing by the Required Lenders or such other number or percentage of Lenders required by Section 9.01, (iv) owned by a Guarantor upon release of such Guarantor from its obligations under its Guarantee pursuant to clause (c) below or (v) as expressly provided in the Collateral Documents;
 
(b)     [Reserved];
 
(c)     execute any documents and instruments reasonably requested by the Borrower to evidence the release of any Guarantor from its obligations under the Guarantee if (i) all or substantially all of the assets of any Guarantor other than Holdings or all of the Capital Stock of any Guarantor other than Holdings is sold (including by consolidation, merger, issuance or otherwise) or disposed of (including by liquidation, dissolution or otherwise) by Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) unless Holdings elects otherwise, any Guarantor other than Holdings is designated an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, (iii) such Person ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary or becomes an Excluded Subsidiary as a result of a transaction or designation permitted hereunder (it being understood that, in each case under this clause (c), any such Person shall be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged from all obligations under its Guarantee upon notice from Borrower to the Administrative Agent to such effect, without any further action required on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender), in each case, only to the extent such transaction is in compliance with the Loan Documents; 
 
(d)     upon receipt of an Officer’s Certificate stating that such Indebtedness (or Liens securing such Indebtedness, if applicable) is permitted under the Loan Documents, enter into intercreditor agreements or arrangements (including any amendment, supplement or other modification of any Collateral Document to add or provide for additional secured parties) with respect to Indebtedness (or Liens securing such Indebtedness) that is required or permitted to be pari passu with or subordinated to the Loan Obligations (or the Liens securing the Loan Obligations) pursuant to Section 6.03; and
 

94

 

 
(e)     release the Borrower from its obligations under the Loan Documents, without the consent of the Lenders, if: (1) Holdings or any successor to Holdings has assumed the obligations of the Borrower under the Loan Documents, by executing and delivering documentation that is reasonably satisfactory in form to the Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders, (2) the Borrower shall execute a Guarantee, (3) Holdings delivers an Opinion of Counsel to the Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders that such Guarantee is permitted by the terms of this Agreement, and has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Borrower and constitutes a valid and binding obligations of the Borrower, enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with its terms (subject to customary exceptions), until such time, if any, such Guarantee may be released pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and that all conditions precedent (if any) to the execution of such Guarantee provided for in this Agreement have been complied with and (4) any other Loan party shall provide any affirmation or Collateral Documents reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders.
 
In each case as specified in this Section 8.08, upon receipt of an Officer’s Certificate, the Administrative Agent will (and each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to), at the Borrower’s expense, deliver, upon the request of the applicable Loan Party, to such Loan Party or any designee of such Loan Party any certificates, powers or other physical collateral held by it and relating to such item of Collateral (but subject to the requirements of any applicable intercreditor agreement) and execute and deliver to the applicable Loan Party such documents as such Loan Party may reasonably request to evidence the release of such item of Collateral from the assignment and security interest granted under the Collateral Documents, release such Guarantor from its obligations under the Guarantee or execute and deliver the agreements described in clause (d) above, in each case, in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents and this Section 8.08; provided that the Borrower shall have delivered to the Administrative Agent (i) a certificate of a Responsible Officer of the Borrower certifying that any such transaction has been consummated in compliance with this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably request and (ii) an Opinion of Counsel confirming that such release is permitted by Section 8.08. Additionally, with respect to subordinating the Administrative Agent’s security interest in Collateral to a Permitted Lien which is permitted pursuant to this agreement to rank senior to the Loans, upon the request of the applicable Loan Party, execute and deliver to the applicable Loan Party such documents as such Loan Party may reasonably request to evidence the subordination of the Administrative Agent’s security interest in the Collateral to such Permitted Lien; provided that the Borrower shall have delivered to the Administrative Agent a certificate of a Responsible Officer of the Borrower certifying that any such subordination has been consummated in compliance with this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably request and (ii) an Opinion of Counsel confirming that such subordination is permitted by this Agreement..
 
Each Secured Party hereby further authorizes the Administrative Agent on behalf of and for the benefit of the Secured Parties, (a) to be the agent for and representative of the Secured Parties with respect to the Collateral and the Collateral Documents, (b) to enter into any applicable intercreditor agreement contemplated by this agreement, including without limitation any Intercreditor Agreement and (c) to take any actions thereunder as determined by the Administrative Agent to be necessary or advisable. Each Secured Party hereby further authorizes the Administrative Agent on behalf of and for the benefit of the Secured Parties to enter into any other intercreditor agreement reasonably required by the Loan Documents (including without limitation, any Intercreditor Agreement), and each Secured Party agrees to be bound by the terms of such intercreditor agreement. 
 
Anything contained in any of the Loan Documents to the contrary notwithstanding, the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and each Secured Party hereby agree that (i) unless the Administrative Agent consents thereto, no Secured Party shall have any right individually to realize upon any of the Collateral or to enforce the Loan Documents, it being understood and agreed that all powers, rights and remedies hereunder may be exercised solely by the Administrative Agent on behalf of itself and the Lenders in accordance with the terms hereof and all powers, rights and remedies under the Collateral Documents may be exercised solely by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Secured Parties, and (ii) in the event of a foreclosure by the Administrative Agent on any of the Collateral pursuant to a public or private sale or other disposition, the Administrative Agent or any Lender may be the purchaser or licensor of any or all of such Collateral at any such sale or other disposition and the Administrative Agent, as agent for and representative of the Secured Parties (but not any Lender or Lenders in its or their respective individual capacities unless the Administrative Agent shall otherwise agree in writing) shall be entitled, for the purpose of bidding and making settlement or payment of the purchase price for all or any portion of the Collateral sold at any such public sale, to use and apply any of the Loan Obligations as a credit on account of the purchase price for any collateral payable by the Administrative Agent at such sale or other disposition.

SECTION 8.09     [Reserved] 
 
SECTION 8.10     Appointment of Supplemental Administrative Agents.
 
(a)     It is the purpose of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents that there shall be no violation of any Law of any jurisdiction denying or restricting the right of banking corporations or associations to transact business as agent or trustee in such jurisdiction. It is recognized that in case of litigation under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, and in particular in case of the enforcement of any of the Loan Documents, or in case the Administrative Agent deems that by reason of any present or future Law of any jurisdiction it may not exercise any of the rights, powers or remedies granted herein or in any of the other Loan Documents or take any other action which may be desirable or necessary in connection therewith, the Administrative Agent is hereby authorized to appoint an additional individual or institution selected by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion as a separate trustee, co-trustee, administrative agent, collateral agent, administrative sub-agent or administrative co-agent (any such additional individual or institution being referred to herein individually as a “Supplemental Administrative Agent” and collectively as “Supplemental Administrative Agents”).
 
(b)     In the event that the Administrative Agent appoints a Supplemental Administrative Agent with respect to any Collateral, (i) each and every right, power, privilege or duty expressed or intended by this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents to be exercised by or vested in or conveyed to the Administrative Agent with respect to such Collateral shall be exercisable by and vest in such Supplemental Administrative Agent to the extent, and only to the extent, necessary to enable such Supplemental Administrative Agent to exercise such rights, powers and privileges with respect to such Collateral and to perform such duties with respect to such Collateral, and every covenant and obligation contained in the Loan Documents and necessary to the exercise or performance thereof by such Supplemental Administrative Agent shall run to and be enforceable by either the Administrative Agent or such Supplemental Administrative Agent, and (ii) the provisions of this Article 8 and of Section 9.05 (obligating the Borrower to pay the Administrative Agent’s expenses and to indemnify the Administrative Agent) that refer to the Administrative Agent shall inure to the benefit of such Supplemental Administrative Agent and all references therein to the Administrative Agent shall be deemed to be references to the Administrative Agent and/or such Supplemental Administrative Agent, as the context may require.
 
(c)     Should any instrument in writing from the Borrower or any other Loan Party be required by any Supplemental Administrative Agent so appointed by the Administrative Agent for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to it such rights, powers, privileges and duties, the Borrower shall, or shall cause such Loan Party to, execute, acknowledge and deliver any and all such instruments promptly upon request by the Administrative Agent. In case any Supplemental Administrative Agent, or a successor thereto, shall die, become incapable of acting, resign or be removed, all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of such Supplemental Administrative Agent, to the extent permitted by Law, shall vest in and be exercised by the Administrative Agent until the appointment of a new Supplemental Administrative Agent.
 

96

 

 
(d)     No Administrative Agent shall be responsible for the actions of any other administrative agent appointed pursuant to this Section 8.10.
 
SECTION 8.11     Administrative Agent May File Proofs of Claim. In case of the pendency of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or any other judicial proceeding relative to any Loan Party, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise:
 
(a)     to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans and all other Loan Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders and the Administrative Agent under Section 2.07) allowed in such judicial proceeding; and
 
(b)     to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same; and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, if the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Administrative Agent under Section 2.07.
 
Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Loan Obligations or the rights of any Lender to authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender or in any such proceeding.
 
SECTION 8.12     Indemnification of Administrative Agent. Each Lender, on a pro rata basis, based on its Aggregate Exposure Percentage, severally (but not jointly) agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent and its Related Parties, to the extent that the Administrative Agent or its Related Parties shall not have been reimbursed by any Loan Party, for and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses (including Attorney Costs (which shall be limited to one (1) counsel, at any given time, to the Administrative Agent, and if reasonably necessary, one (1) local counsel, at any given time, to the Administrative Agent in each relevant jurisdiction)) or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or on behalf of or asserted against the Administrative Agent or its Related Parties (solely to the extent such Related Party was performing services on behalf of the Administrative Agent) in exercising its powers, rights and remedies or performing its duties hereunder or under the other Loan Documents or otherwise in its capacity as the Administrative Agent in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents (including in connection with enforcing a Lender’s indemnification obligation hereunder); provided that no Lender shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from the Administrative Agent’s or its Related Parties’, as applicable, gross negligence or willful misconduct, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable judgment. 
 

97

 

 
In addition, each Lender hereby severally (but not jointly) agrees to reimburse the Administrative Agent and each of its Related Parties promptly upon demand for such Lender’s pro rata share based on its Aggregate Exposure Percentage of any costs and expenses (including Attorney Costs (which shall be limited to one (1) counsel, at any given time, to the Administrative Agent, and if reasonably necessary, one (1) local counsel, at any given time, to the Administrative Agent in each relevant jurisdiction)) that may be incurred by the Administrative Agent or any of its Related Parties, to the extent not reimbursed by a Loan Party, in connection with the preparation, syndication, execution, delivery, administration, modification, consent, waiver or enforcement (whether through negotiations, through any work-out, bankruptcy, restructuring or other legal or other proceeding or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of its rights or responsibilities under, any Loan Document.
 
SECTION 8.13     Agency for Perfection. The Administrative Agent hereby appoints, authorizes and directs each Secured Party to act as collateral sub-agent for the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties for purposes of the perfection of all Liens with respect to the Collateral, including any deposit account maintained by a Loan Party with, and cash and Cash Equivalents held by, such Secured Party, and may further authorize and direct such Secured Party to take further actions as collateral sub-agents for purposes of enforcing such Liens or otherwise to transfer the Collateral subject thereto to the Administrative Agent, and each Secured Party hereby agrees to take such further actions to the extent, and only to the extent, so authorized and directed. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 8.13 is intended to require the parties hereto to enter into any account control agreements not otherwise required hereunder. For the avoidance of doubt, any Secured Party that is appointed as a collateral sub-agent for the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to the benefits set forth in Section 8.05.

No Indemnitee shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by others of any information or other materials obtained through Syndtrak, IntraLinks, the internet, email or other similar information transmission systems in connection with this Agreement, in each case, except to the extent any such damages are found in a final non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee nor shall any Indemnitee or any Loan Party have any liability for any special, punitive, indirect or consequential damages relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or arising out of its activities in connection herewith or therewith (whether before or after the Closing Date); provided that nothing contained in this sentence shall limit the Borrower’s indemnification and reimbursement obligations under this Agreement. The Borrower shall not be liable for any settlement in respect of any Indemnified Liabilities effected without the Borrower’s consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), but if settled with the Borrower’s prior written consent, or (without limitation of the Borrower’s obligations set forth above) if there is a final judgment against an Indemnitee, the Borrower agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnitee in the manner set forth above. 
 

102

 

 
The Borrower shall not, without the prior written consent of the affected Indemnitee (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), effect any settlement of any pending or threatened Indemnified Liability against such Indemnitee in respect of which indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnitee unless such settlement (a) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnitee from all liability or claims that are the subject matter of such claimed or threatened Indemnified Liability, (b) does not include any statement as to any admission of fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of such Indemnitee and (c) includes customary confidentiality provisions reasonably acceptable to such Indemnitee. 
 
In the case of an investigation, litigation or other proceeding to which the indemnity in this Section 9.05 applies, such indemnity shall be effective whether or not such investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought by any Loan Party, its directors, shareholders or creditors or an Indemnitee or any other Person, whether or not any Indemnitee is otherwise a party thereto and whether or not any of the transactions contemplated hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents is consummated. All amounts due under this Section 9.05 shall be reimbursed within ten (10) Business Days of written demand therefor (together with reasonable backup documentation).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if it is found by a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction in any such action, proceeding or investigation that any loss, claim, damage or liability of any Indemnitee has resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee (or any of its Related Indemnitees), such Indemnitee will repay such portion of the reimbursed amounts previously paid to such Indemnitee under this Section that is attributable to expenses incurred in relation to the act or omission of such Indemnitee which is the subject of such finding.
 

103

 

 
SECTION 9.06     Marshalling; Payments Set Aside. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall be under any obligation to marshal any assets in favor of any Loan Party or any other Person or against or in payment of any or all of the Loan Obligations.

SECTION 9.07     Successors and Assigns.  (a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender and the acknowledgement of the Administrative Agent, and any such assignment without such consent shall be null and void (for the avoidance of doubt, any such transfer that occurs pursuant to a transaction permitted under Section 6.11 is permitted hereunder without any such consent), and no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder except (i) to an Eligible Assignee in accordance with the provisions of Section 9.07(b), or (ii) by way of pledge or assignment of a security interest subject to the restrictions of Section 9.07(g) or Section 9.07(i), as the case may be. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants to the extent provided in Section 9.07(e) and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Indemnitees) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.
 
(b)     Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement; provided that (i) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund with respect to a Lender, the aggregate amount of such assignment, determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent shall not be less than $1,000,000, in the case of any assignment in respect of any Loans (provided, however, that concurrent assignments to or by Approved Funds will be treated as a single assignment for the purpose of meeting the minimum transfer requirements), (ii)  each of the Administrative Agent (except in the case of an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund (but subject to clause (iv) below)), and, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower consents to such assignment, (iii) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Loans or the Commitment assigned, except that this clause (iii) shall not prohibit any Lender from assigning all or a portion of its rights and obligations among separate Facilities on a non-pro rata basis, (iv) the parties (other than the Borrower unless its consent to such assignment is required hereunder) to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500 (which fee (x) the Borrower shall not have an obligation to pay except as required in Section 3.07 and (y) may be waived or reduced by the Administrative Agent in its discretion) and (v) the assigning Lender shall deliver any Notes evidencing such Loans to the Borrower or the Administrative Agent if requested. 
 

104

 

 
Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 9.07(c), from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the Eligible Assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.01, Section 3.04 and Section 9.05 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment and shall continue to be bound by Section 9.08). Upon request, the Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and deliver a Note to the assignee Lender; provided that if the Borrower has previously issued an assigning Lender a Note, then the Borrower shall have no obligation to deliver a Note to the assignee Lender except upon the surrender by the assigning Lender of its Note (or receipt by the Borrower of a certificate of loss including reasonably satisfactory indemnification provisions). 
 
(c)     The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at the Administrative Agent’s Office a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts (and stated interest amounts) of the Loans, owing to each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the “Register”). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Agents and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as the owner of its interests in the Loans and amounts due under the Loan Documents as set forth in the Register and as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower, any Agent, any Lender (solely with respect to such Lender’s interest), at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Loans and Loan Obligations are intended to be treated as registered obligations for U.S. federal income Tax purposes. Any right or title in or to any Loans and Loan Obligations (including with respect to the principal amount and any interest thereon) may only be assigned or otherwise transferred through the Register. This Section 9.07 shall be construed so that the Loans and Loan Obligations are at all times maintained in “registered form” within the meaning of Sections 163(f), 871(h)(2) and 881(c)(2) of the Code, Treasury Regulation Section 5f.103-1(c) and any other related regulations (or any successor provisions of the Code or such regulations).
 
(d)     The words “execution,” “signed,” “signature” and words of like import in any Assignment and Assumption shall be deemed to include electronic signatures or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent and as provided for in any applicable Law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act or any other similar state laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act.
 

105

 

 
(e)     Any Lender may at any time, with the consent of the Borrower, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, but without the consent of, or notice to, the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural person, the Borrower, Holdings or any Affiliate of the Borrower or Holdings or (unless a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing) a Competitor) (each, a “Participant”) in all or a portion of such Lender’s rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the Agents and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in the clauses (a) through (i) of the first proviso to Section 9.01 that directly and adversely affects such Participant. Subject to Section 9.07(f), the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.01 and Section 3.04 (subject to the requirements and limitations therein, including the requirements under Section 3.01(f) and Section 3.06 read as if a Participant were a Lender (it being understood that the documentation required thereunder shall be delivered to the participating Lender and the Administrative Agent)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to Section 9.07(b); provided that such Participant agrees to bound by such Sections, including for the avoidance of doubt to be subject to the provisions of Section 3.01(f) and Section 3.06 as if it were an assignee under paragraph (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by Law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.09 as though it were a Lender; provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.11 as though it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as an non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant’s interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the “Participant Register”); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant’s interest in any Commitments or any Loans or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Commitment or Loan or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender (and the Borrower, to the extent that the Participant requests payment from the Borrower) shall treat each person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.
 
(f)     A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 3.01 or Section 3.04 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant.
 
(g)     Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank or any central bank having jurisdiction over such Lender; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.
 
(h)     [Reserved].
 
(i)     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender (a “Pledging Lender”) shall have the right from time to time in its discretion and without the consent of Borrower to pledge, securitize, encumber, hypothecate, or otherwise transfer (a “Pledge”) all or any portion of its interest in the Loan to an Eligible Assignee (each, a “Pledgee”); provided that unless and until the applicable Pledgee actually becomes a Lender in compliance with the other provisions of this Section 9.07, (i) no such Pledge shall release the Pledging Lender from any of its obligations under the Loan Documents and, (ii) such Pledgee shall not be entitled to exercise any of the rights of a Lender under the Loan Documents even though such Pledgee may have acquired ownership rights with respect to the pledged interest through foreclosure or otherwise (unless such Pledgee is an Eligible Assignee which has complied with the requirements of Section 9.07(b)).
 

106

 

 
(j)     [Reserved].
 
(k)     Assignments of Loans to any Purchasing Borrower Party shall be permitted through open market purchases and/or “Dutch auctions,” so long as any offer to purchase or take by assignment (other than through open market purchases) by such Purchasing Borrower Party shall have been made to all Lenders, so long as (i) no Default or an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and (ii) the Loans purchased are immediately cancelled pursuant to Section 9.07(l).
 
(l)     Upon any purchase of Loans by a Purchasing Borrower Party, such Loans shall be immediately contributed to the Borrower, whereupon, (i) the aggregate principal amount (calculated on the face amount thereof) of such Loans shall automatically be cancelled and retired by the Borrower on the date of such contribution or purchase (and, if requested by the Administrative Agent, with respect to a contribution of Loans, any applicable contributing Lender shall execute and deliver to the applicable Agent an Assignment and Assumption, or such other form as may be reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent, in respect thereof pursuant to which the respective Lender assigns its interest in such Loans to the Borrower for immediate cancellation) and (ii) the applicable Agent shall record such cancellation or retirement in the Register.
 
SECTION 9.08      [Reserved]. 
 
SECTION 9.09     Setoff. In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided by Law, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, after obtaining the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, each Lender is authorized at any time and from time to time, without prior notice to the Borrower or any other Loan Party, any such notice being waived by the Borrower (on its own behalf and on behalf of each other Loan Party) to the fullest extent permitted by Law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held by, and other Indebtedness at any time owing by, such Lender to or for the credit or the account of the respective Loan Parties against any and all Loan Obligations owing to such Lender hereunder or under any other Loan Document, now or hereafter existing, irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall have made demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and although such Loan Obligations may be contingent or unmatured or denominated in a currency different from that of the applicable deposit or Indebtedness; provided that in the event that any Defaulting Lender shall exercise any such right of setoff, (x) all amounts so set off shall be paid over immediately to the Administrative Agent for further application in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.15 and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and (y) the Defaulting Lender shall provide promptly to the Administrative Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the Loan Obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as to which it exercised such right of setoff. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent after any such set off and application made by such Lender; provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application. The rights of the Administrative Agent and each Lender under this Section 9.09 are in addition to other rights and remedies (including, without limitation, other rights of setoff) that the Administrative Agent and such Lender may have.
 

107

 

 
SECTION 9.10     Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid under the Loan Documents shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious interest permitted by applicable Law (the “Maximum Rate”). If any Agent or any Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the Borrower. In determining whether the interest contracted for, charged, or received by an Agent or a Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the Loan Obligations hereunder.
 
SECTION 9.11     Counterparts. This Agreement and each other Loan Document may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Delivery by telecopier or other electronic transmission (including portable document format) of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement and each other Loan Document shall be effective as delivery of an original executed counterpart of this Agreement and such other Loan Document. The Agents may also require that any such documents and signatures delivered by telecopier or other electronic means be confirmed by a manually signed original thereof; provided that the failure to request or deliver the same shall not limit the effectiveness of any document or signature delivered by telecopier or other electronic transmission.
 
SECTION 9.12     Integration. This Agreement, together with the other Loan Documents, comprises the complete and integrated agreement of the parties on the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersedes all prior agreements, written or oral, on such subject matter. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and those of any other Loan Document, the provisions of this Agreement shall control; provided that the inclusion of supplemental rights or remedies in favor of the Agents or the Lenders in any other Loan Document shall not be deemed to be a conflict with this Agreement. Each Loan Document was drafted with the joint participation of the respective parties thereto and shall be construed neither against nor in favor of any party, but rather in accordance with the fair meaning thereof.
 
SECTION 9.13     Survival. All representations and warranties made hereunder and in any other Loan Document or other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and thereof. Such representations and warranties have been or will be relied upon by each Agent and each Lender, regardless of any investigation made by any Agent or any Lender or on their behalf and notwithstanding that any Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default at the time of any Borrowing, and shall continue in full force and effect until the Termination Date. The provisions of Article 3 and Article 8 and Section 9.05, 9.08, 9.15 and 9.16 shall survive and remain in full force and effect following the Termination Date. 
 
SECTION 9.14     Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, the legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall not be affected or impaired thereby. The invalidity of a provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this Section 9.14, if and to the extent that the enforceability of any provisions in this Agreement relating to Defaulting Lenders shall be limited by Debtor Relief Laws, as determined in good faith by the Administrative Agent, then such provisions shall be deemed to be in effect only to the extent not so limited.
 
SECTION 9.15     GOVERNING LAW.
 
(a)     THIS AGREEMENT AND EACH OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT (OTHER THAN ANY LOAN DOCUMENT EXPRESSLY GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION) SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
 

108

 

 
(b)     ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT SHALL BE BROUGHT IN THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK SITTING IN NEW YORK CITY IN THE BOROUGH OF MANHATTAN OR OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF SUCH STATE, AND BY EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT, EACH OF THE BORROWER, EACH AGENT AND EACH LENDER CONSENTS, FOR ITSELF AND IN RESPECT OF ITS PROPERTY, TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THOSE COURTS AND APPELLATE COURTS FROM ANY THEREOF (OTHER THAN WITH RESPECT TO ACTIONS BY ANY AGENT OR ANY LENDER IN RESPECT OF RIGHTS UNDER ANY COLLATERAL DOCUMENT GOVERNED BY A LAW OTHER THAN THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK OR WITH RESPECT TO ANY COLLATERAL SUBJECT THERETO). EACH OF THE BORROWER, EACH AGENT AND EACH LENDER IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY OBJECTION, INCLUDING ANY OBJECTION TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OR BASED ON THE GROUNDS OF FORUM NON CONVENIENS, WHICH IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE BRINGING OF ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN SUCH JURISDICTION IN RESPECT OF ANY LOAN DOCUMENT OR OTHER DOCUMENT RELATED THERETO.
 
SECTION 9.16     WAIVER OF RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING UNDER ANY LOAN DOCUMENT OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES HERETO OR ANY OF THEM WITH RESPECT TO ANY LOAN DOCUMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED THERETO, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER FOUNDED IN CONTRACT OR TORT OR OTHERWISE; AND EACH PARTY HEREBY AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY, AND THAT ANY PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF THIS Section 9.16 WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE SIGNATORIES HERETO TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.
 
SECTION 9.17     Binding Effect. This Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall have been notified by each Lender that each such Lender has executed it and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Borrower, each Agent and each Lender and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
 
SECTION 9.18     U.S.A PATRIOT Act Notice. Each Lender that is subject to the PATRIOT Act and the Administrative Agent (for itself and not on behalf of any Lender) hereby notifies the Borrower that pursuant to the requirements of the PATRIOT Act, it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Borrower and each other Loan Party, which information includes the name and address of the Borrower and each other Loan Party and other information that will allow such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, to identify the Borrower and each other Loan Party in accordance with the PATRIOT Act.
 

109

 

 
SECTION 9.19     No Advisory or Fiduciary Relationship. In connection with all aspects of each transaction contemplated hereby, each of Holdings and the Borrower acknowledge and agrees that (a) the Facilities provided for hereunder and any related arranging or other services in connection therewith (including in connection with any amendment, waiver or other modification hereof or of any other Loan Document) are an arm’s-length commercial transaction between Holdings and the Borrower, on the one hand, and the Agents and the Lenders, on the other hand, and Holdings and the Borrower are capable of evaluating and understanding and understand and accept the terms, risks and conditions of the transactions contemplated hereby and by the other Loan Documents (including any amendment, waiver or other modification hereof or thereof); (b) in connection with the process leading to such transaction, each of the Agents and the Lenders is and has been acting solely as a principal and is not the agent or fiduciary, for the Borrower; and (c) the Agents and the Lenders have not provided and will not provide any legal, accounting, regulatory or tax advice with respect to any of the transactions contemplated hereby (including any amendment, waiver or other modification hereof or of any other Loan Document) and Holdings and the Borrower have consulted their own legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent they have deemed appropriate.
 
ARTICLE X

GUARANTEES; RELEASE OF GUARANTOR
 
SECTION 10.01     Guarantee. Each of the Guarantors hereby unconditionally guarantees, jointly and severally with each other Guarantor, to each Lender and to the Administrative Agent and its successors and assigns, irrespective of the validity and enforceability of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or the obligations of the Borrower hereunder or thereunder, that: (i) the due and punctual payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Loans, whether at maturity or on an interest payment date, by acceleration, pursuant to any prepayment pursuant to Section 2.03, Change of Control Offer or otherwise, to the extent lawful, and all other obligations of the Borrower to the Lenders or the Administrative Agent hereunder or thereunder shall be promptly paid in full when due, all in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof, including all amounts payable to the Administrative Agent under Section 9.05 hereof, and (ii) in case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any Loans or any of such other obligations, the same shall be promptly paid in full when due or performed in accordance with the terms of the extension or renewal, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise. 
 
If the Borrower fails to make any payment when due of any amount so guaranteed for whatever reason, each Guarantor shall be obligated, jointly and severally with each other Guarantor, to pay the same immediately. Each Guarantor hereby agrees that its obligations hereunder shall be continuing, absolute and unconditional, irrespective of, and shall be unaffected by, the validity, regularity or enforceability of the Loans, this Agreement, the Collateral Documents, the absence of any action to enforce the same, any waiver or consent by any Lender or the Administrative Agent with respect to any provisions hereof or thereof, the recovery of any judgment against the Borrower, any action to enforce the same or any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of such Guarantor. If any Lender or the Administrative Agent is required by any court or otherwise to return to the Borrower or any Guarantor, or any custodian, trustee, liquidator or other similar official acting in relation to the Borrower or such Guarantor, any amount paid by the Borrower or any Guarantor to the Administrative Agent or such Lender, this Article X, to the extent theretofore discharged with respect to any Guarantee, shall be reinstated in full force and effect. Each Guarantor agrees that it shall not be entitled to any right of subrogation in relation to the Lenders in respect of any obligations guaranteed hereby by such Guarantor until payment in full of all such obligations. Each Guarantor further agrees that, as between such Guarantor, on the one hand, and the Lenders of Loans and the Administrative Agent on the other hand, (i) the maturity of the obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in Article VII hereof for the purposes of such Guarantee, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the obligations guaranteed hereby and (ii) in the event of any acceleration of such obligations as provided in Article VII hereof such obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by such Guarantor, jointly and severally with each other Guarantor, for the purpose of this Article X. In addition, without limiting the foregoing, upon the effectiveness of an acceleration under Article VII, the Administrative Agent may make a demand for payment on the Loans under any Guarantee provided hereunder and not discharged.
 

110

 

 
SECTION 10.02     Obligations of each Guarantor Unconditional. Nothing contained in this Article X or elsewhere in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document is intended to or shall impair, as between each Guarantor and the Lenders, the obligations of such Guarantor which are absolute and unconditional, to pay to the Lenders the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Loans as and when the same shall become due and payable in accordance with the provisions of their Guarantee or is intended to or shall affect the relative rights of the Lenders and creditors of such Guarantor, nor shall anything herein or therein prevent the Administrative Agent or any Lender from exercising all remedies otherwise permitted by applicable Law upon any Default under this Agreement in respect of cash, property or securities of such Guarantor received upon the exercise of any such remedy.
 
Upon any distribution of assets of a Guarantor referred to in this Article X, the Administrative Agent, subject to the provisions of Article VIII, and the Lenders shall be entitled to rely upon any order or decree made by any court of competent jurisdiction in which such dissolution, winding up, liquidation or reorganization proceedings are pending, or a certificate of the liquidating trustee or agent or other person making any distribution to the Administrative Agent or to such Lenders for the purpose of ascertaining the persons entitled to participate in such distribution, the holders of other indebtedness of such Guarantor, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this Article X.
 
SECTION 10.03     Release of a Guarantor. If (i) all or substantially all of the assets of any Guarantor other than Holdings or all of the Capital Stock of any Guarantor other than Holdings is sold (including by consolidation, merger, issuance or otherwise) or disposed of (including by liquidation, dissolution or otherwise) by Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) unless Holdings elects otherwise, any Guarantor other than Holdings is designated an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or becomes an Excluded Subsidiary, (iii) the Termination Date shall have occurred, or (iv) in accordance with Section 9.01, then in each case such Guarantor or the Person acquiring such assets (in the event of a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of a Guarantor), as the case may be, shall be deemed automatically and unconditionally released and discharged from any of its obligations under this Agreement without any further action on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender.
 
SECTION 10.04     Execution and Delivery of Guarantee. The execution by each Guarantor of this Agreement (or a joinder to this Agreement) together with an executed guarantee substantially in the form included in Exhibit I evidences the Guarantee of such Guarantor.
 
SECTION 10.05     Limitation on Guarantor Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article X, each Guarantor, the Administrative Agent and each Lender hereby confirms that it is the intention of all such parties that the Guarantee of such Guarantor not constitute a fraudulent conveyance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the Bankruptcy Law or any comparable provision of state law. To effectuate that intention, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Guarantors hereby irrevocably agree that the obligations of each Guarantor under its Guarantee are limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the Bankruptcy Law or any comparable provision of state law.
 
SECTION 10.06     Article X not to Prevent Events of Default. The failure to make a payment on account of principal, premium, if any, or interest, if any, on the Loans by reason of any provision in this Article X shall not be construed as preventing the occurrence of any Event of Default under Section 7.01 hereof.
 

111

 

 
SECTION 10.07     Waiver by the Guarantors. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, each Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, demand of performance, filing of claims with a court in the event of insolvency of bankruptcy of the Borrower, any right to require a proceeding first against the Borrower, the benefit of discussion, protest, notice and all demand whatsoever and covenants that this Guarantee shall not be discharged except by complete performance of the obligations contained in this Agreement, any other Loan Document and in this Article X.
 
SECTION 10.08     Subrogation and Contribution. Upon making any payment with respect to any obligation of the Borrower under this Article, the Guarantor making such payment shall be subrogated to the rights of the payee against the Borrower with respect to such obligation; provided, that the Guarantor may not enforce either any right of subrogation, or any right to receive payment in the nature of contribution, or otherwise, from any other Guarantor, with respect to such payment so long as any amount payable by the Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document remains unpaid.
 
Each Guarantor that makes a payment under its Guarantee shall be entitled, upon payment in full of all guaranteed obligations under this Agreement, to seek and receive contribution from and against each other Guarantor in an amount equal to such other Guarantor’s pro rata portion of such payment based on the respective net assets of all the Guarantors at the time of such payment determined in accordance with GAAP.
 
SECTION 10.09     Stay of Acceleration. If acceleration of the time for payment of any amount payable by the Borrower under this Agreement or any other Loan Document is stayed upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Borrower, all such amounts otherwise subject to acceleration under the terms of this Agreement are nonetheless payable by the Guarantors hereunder forthwith on demand by the Administrative Agent or the Lenders.

FORM OF NOTE
 
Date: [●]
 
FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned, hereby promises to pay to _____________________ or its registered assigns (the “Lender”), in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Agreement (as hereinafter defined), the aggregate unpaid principal amount of each Loan made by the Lender to the Borrower (as defined below) on the Maturity Date or at such times as provided under that certain Credit Agreement dated as of January 29, 2018 (as amended, restated, amended and restated, extended, supplemented or otherwise modified in writing from time to time, the “Credit Agreement”; the terms defined therein being used herein as therein defined), among Hovnanian Enterprises, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Holdings”), K. Hovnanian Enterprises, Inc., a California corporation (the “Borrower”), each lender from time to time party thereto, and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as Administrative Agent.
 
The Borrower promises to pay interest on the aggregate unpaid principal amount of each Loan made by the Lender to the Borrower under the Credit Agreement from the date of such Loan until such principal amount is paid in full, at such interest rates and at such times as provided in the Credit Agreement. All payments of principal and interest shall be made to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lender in Dollars and in immediately available funds. While any Event of Default set forth in Section 7.01 of the Credit Agreement exists, with respect to the payment of any principal, interest or fees, the applicable unpaid amount shall bear interest, to be paid upon demand, from the due date thereof until the date of actual payment (and before as well as after judgment) computed at the per annum rate or rates set forth in the Credit Agreement.
 
This Note (this “Note”) is one of the Notes referred to in the Credit Agreement, is entitled to the benefits thereof and under the Loan Documents, and may be prepaid in whole or in part subject to the terms and conditions provided therein. This Note is also entitled to the benefits of the Guarantee and is secured by the Collateral granted under the Collateral Documents. Upon the occurrence and continuation of one or more of the Events of Default specified in the Credit Agreement, all amounts then remaining unpaid on this Note may become, or may be declared to be, as applicable, immediately due and payable all as provided in the Credit Agreement. 
 
Loans made by the Lender shall be evidenced by one or more loan accounts or records maintained by the Lender in the ordinary course of business, and the Lender may also attach schedules to this Note and endorse thereon the date, amount and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto; provided, however, that the failure of any Lender to make such endorsement, notation or record or any error in such endorsement, notation or record shall not affect the obligation of the Borrower under this Note.
 
The Borrower, for itself and its successors and assigns, hereby waives diligence, presentment, protest and demand and notice of protest, demand, dishonor and non-payment of this Note.
 
THIS NOTE SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

SOLVENCY CERTIFICATE
[  ], 2018
 
Reference is made to that certain Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”), dated as of January 29, 2018, among K. Hovnanian Enterprises, Inc., a California corporation (the “Borrower”), Hovnanian Enterprises, Inc., a Delaware Corporation (“Holdings”), the other guarantors party thereto from time to time (each a “Subsidiary Guarantor” and, together with Holdings, the “Guarantors”), Wilmington Trust, National Association, as administrative agent (the “Administrative Agent”) and each lender party thereto (each a “Lender” and together, the “Lenders”). Unless otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms used in this Certificate shall have the meanings set forth in the Credit Agreement.
 
I, J. Larry Sorsby, solely in my capacity as the Chief Financial Officer of Holdings and not in my individual capacity, do hereby certify on behalf of Holdings that as of the date hereof and based upon facts and circumstances as they exist as of the date hereof, after giving effect to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Credit Agreement:
 
1.     The present fair saleable value of the properties and assets of Holdings and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, is not less than the total amount that would be required to pay the probable liability of Holdings and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, on their total debts and liabilities (including contingent liabilities) as they become absolute and matured.
 
2.      Holdings and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, are able to realize upon their properties and assets and generally pay their debts and other liabilities, contingent obligations and commitments as they mature and become due in the normal course of business.
 
3.      Holdings and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, do not intend to and do not believe that they will, incur debts or liabilities beyond their ability to pay such debts and liabilities as they mature.
 
4.      Holdings and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, are not engaged in any business or transaction, and do not propose to engage in any business or transaction, for which their properties and assets would constitute unreasonably small capital after giving due consideration to the prevailing practices in the industry in which they are engaged.
 
5.     For purposes of this Certificate, the amount of any contingent liability has been computed in accordance with GAAP.
 
6.     In reaching the conclusions set forth in this Certificate, I have made such investigations and inquiries as I have deemed appropriate, having taken into account the nature of the particular business anticipated to be conducted by Hovnanian and its subsidiaries after consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Credit Agreement.

In such examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as duplicates or certified or conformed copies and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents.  In addition, we have relied as to certain matters of fact upon the representations made in the Credit Documents.

Assuming that each of the Credit Documents is a valid and legally binding obligation of each of the parties thereto (other than the Credit Parties) and assuming that (a) the Borrower and each Non-Covered Guarantor is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized, has the entity power and authority under such laws and its organizational documents to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Credit Documents to which it is a party, and has duly authorized, executed and delivered the Credit Documents to which it is a party in accordance with its organizational documents and the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized, (b) execution, delivery and performance by each Credit Party of the Credit Documents to which it is a party do not violate the organizational documents of any Non-Covered Guarantor or the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized or any other applicable laws (excepting the federal laws of the United States, the law of the State of New York, the DGCL and the DLLCA) and (c) the execution, delivery and performance by each Credit Party of the Credit Documents to which it is a party do not constitute a breach of or default of its organizational documents or under any agreement or instrument which is binding upon such Credit Party (except that we do not make the assumption in the foregoing clause (c) with respect to the agreements and instruments that are the subject of opinion paragraph 2 of this opinion letter), each Credit Document constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of each Credit Party that is a party thereto, enforceable against such Credit Party in accordance with its terms.

(2)      Each of the Borrower, Holdings and the Specified Subsidiaries is duly qualified and is in good standing as a foreign corporation or limited liability company authorized to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or its ownership or leasing of property requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified would not have a Material Adverse Effect;
 
(3)      All the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Borrower, Holdings and the Specified Subsidiaries have been duly authorized and validly issued and, except with respect to Holdings’ Rights Plan as described in the Public Filings, are fully paid, non-assessable and not subject to any preemptive or similar rights;

(7)      After due inquiry, I do not know of any legal or governmental proceedings pending or threatened to which the Borrower, Holdings or any of their subsidiaries is or could be a party or to which any of their respective property is or could be subject, which might result, singly or in the aggregate, in a Material Adverse Effect, except as disclosed in the Public Filings; and 
 
In addition, I express no opinion and render no advice with respect to:
 


 

i.

the effect of any provision of the Security Documents that is intended to establish any standard other than a standard set forth in the New York UCC as the measure of the performance by any party thereto of such party’s obligations of good faith, diligence, reasonableness or car

other than the laws of the State of New Jersey, the State of New York and the State of California, the federal law of the United States of America and the Delaware General Corporation Law.
 
[I note that the Hague Convention on the Law Applicable to Certain Rights in Respect of Securities Held with an Intermediary (the “Hague Convention”) sets forth certain choice of law rules that apply to certain issues in respect of securities held with a securities intermediary in a securities account. I express no opinion as to the applicability to, or the effects on, the opinions rendered herein of the Hague Convention’s choice of law rules with respect to issues identified in Article 2 (1) of the Hague Convention.]

provided, however, that notwithstanding any of the other provisions set forth in this Article 2 (and notwithstanding any recording of the Agent’s Lien in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or other registry office in any jurisdiction), this Agreement shall not constitute a grant of a security interest in, and the Collateral shall not include, (i) any property or assets constituting “Excluded Property” (as defined in the Credit Agreement) or (ii) any property to the extent that such grant of a security interest is prohibited by any applicable Law of an Official Body, requires a consent not obtained of any Official Body pursuant to such Law or is prohibited by, or constitutes a breach or default under or results in the termination of or gives rise to any right of acceleration, modification or cancellation or requires any consent not obtained under, any contract, license, agreement, instrument or other document evidencing or giving rise to such property or, in the case of any Investment Property, or Pledged Note, any applicable shareholder or similar agreement, except to the extent that such Law or the term in such contract, l

mination or requiring such consent is ineffective under applicable Law including Sections 9-406, 9-407, 9-408 or 9-409 of the New York UCC (or any successor provision or provisions); provided, further, that no security interest shall be granted in United States “intent-to-use” trademark or service mark applications unless and until acceptable evidence of use of the trademark or service mark has been filed with and accepted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office pursuant to Section 1(c) or Section 1(d) of the Lanham Act (U.S.C. 1051, et. seq.), and to the extent that, and solely during the period in which, the grant of a security interest therein would impair the validity or enforceability of such intent-to-use trademark or service mark applications under applicable federal Law. After such period and after such evidence of use has been filed and accepted, each Grantor acknowledges that such interest in such trademark or service mark applications will become part of the Collateral. The Agent agrees that, at any Grantor’s reasonable request and expense, it will provide such Grantor confirmation that the assets described in this paragraph are in fact excluded from the Collateral during such limited period only upon receipt of an Officers’ Certificate or an Opinion of Counsel to that effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act requires (or is replaced with another rule or regulation, or any other law, rule or regulation is adopted, which would require) the filing with the SEC of separate financial statements (including if the Loans were “Securities” under the Securities Act) of the Borrower, any Guarantor or of K. Hovnanian JV Holdings, L.L.C., then the capital stock or other securities of the Borrower, such Guarantor or of K. Hovnanian JV Holdings, L.L.C., as applicable, shall automatically be deemed released and not to be and not to have been part of the Collateral but only to the extent necessary to not be subject to such requirement. In such event, this Agreement may be amended or modified, without the consent of any Lender, upon the Agent’s receipt of a written authorization from the Borrower stating that such amendment is permitted hereunder, which the Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely upon, to the extent necessary to evidence the release of the lien created hereby on the shares of capital stock or other securities that are so deemed to no longer constitute part of the Collateral.

The Agent shall endeavor to provide the Borrower with notice at or about the time of such verifications, provided that the failure to provide such notice shall not in any way compromise or adversely affect the exercise of such remedy or the Agent’s rights hereunder.
 

11

 

 
(b)     The Agent hereby authorizes each Grantor to collect such Grantor’s Receivables and the Agent may curtail or terminate said authority at any time after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default. The Agent shall endeavor to provide the Borrower with notice at or about the time of the exercise of its rights pursuant to the preceding sentence, provided that the failure to provide such notice shall not in any way compromise or adversely affect the exercise of any rights or remedies hereunder. If requested in writing by the Agent at any time after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, any payments of Receivables, when collected by any Grantor, (i) shall be forthwith (and, in any event, within two Business Days) deposited by such Grantor in the exact form received, duly indorsed by such Grantor to the Agent if required, in a Collateral Account maintained under the sole dominion and control of the Agent, subject to withdrawal by the Agent for the account of the Secured Parties only as provided in Section 6.04 and (ii) until so turned over, shall be held by such Grantor in trust for the Agent and the Secured Parties, segregated from other funds of such Grantor.
 
(c)     At the Agent’s written request at any time after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, each Grantor shall deliver to the Agent all original and other documents evidencing, and relating to, the agreements and transactions which gave rise to the Receivables, including without limitation, all original orders, invoices and shipping receipts.

The Agent shall endeavor to provide the Borrower with notice at or about the time of the exercise of its rights pursuant to the preceding sentence, provided that the failure to provide such notice shall not in any way compromise or adversely affect the exercise of any rights or remedies hereunder.
 
(b)     Upon the written request of the Agent at any time after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, each Grantor shall notify obligors on the Receivables and parties to the Contracts that the Receivables and the Contracts, as the case may be, have been assigned to the Agent for the ratable benefit of the Secured Parties and that payments in respect thereof shall be made directly to the Agent.
 
(c)     Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, each Grantor shall remain liable under each of the Receivables and Contracts to observe and perform all the conditions and obligations to be observed and performed by it thereunder, all in accordance with the terms of any agreement giving rise thereto. Neither the Agent nor any Secured Party shall have any obligation or liability under any Receivable (or any agreement giving rise thereto) or Contract by reason of or arising out of this Agreement or the receipt by the Agent or any Secured Party of any payment relating thereto, nor shall the Agent or any Secured Party be obligated in any manner to perform any of the obligations of any Grantor under or pursuant to any Receivable (or any agreement giving rise thereto) or Contract, to make any payment, to make any inquiry as to the nature or the sufficiency of any payment received by it or as to the sufficiency of any performance by any party thereunder, to present or file any claim, to take any action to enforce any performance or to collect the payment of any amounts which may have been assigned to it or to which it may be entitled at any time or times.

Section 6.03.     Proceeds to Be Turned Over to Agent. In addition to the rights of the Agent and the Secured Parties specified in Section 6.01 with respect to payments of Receivables, if an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, upon written request from the Agent, all Proceeds received by any Grantor consisting of cash, checks and other near-cash items shall be held by such Grantor in trust for the Agent and the Secured Parties, segregated from other funds of such Grantor, and shall, forthwith upon receipt by such Grantor, be turned over to the Agent in the exact form received by such Grantor (duly indorsed by such Grantor to the Agent, if requested). All Proceeds received by the Agent hereunder shall be held by the Agent in a Collateral Account maintained under its sole dominion and control. All such Proceeds while held by the Agent in a Collateral Account (or by such Grantor in trust for the Agent and the Secured Parties) shall continue to be held as collateral security for all the Secured Obligations and shall not constitute payment thereof until applied as provided in Section 6.04.
 
Section 6.04.     Application of Proceeds. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, at any time at the Agent’s election, subject to any Collateral Agency Agreement and any other intercreditor agreement entered into in connection with Indebtedness permitted under the Credit Agreement, the Agent may apply all or any part of the Collateral, whether or not held in the Deposit Accounts, the Securities Accounts or any other Collateral Account, in payment of the Secured Obligations in the order set forth in the Credit Agreement.
 
Section 6.05.     Code and Other Remedies. If an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, the Agent, on behalf of the Secured Parties, may exercise, in addition to all other rights and remedies granted to them in this Agreement and in any other instrument or agreement securing, evidencing or relating to the Secured Obligations, all rights and remedies of a secured party under the New York UCC or any other applicable law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Agent, without prior demand of performance or other demand, presentment, protest, advertisement or notice of any kind (except any prior notice required by law referred to below) to or upon any Grantor or any other Person (all and each of which demands, defenses, advertisements and notices are hereby waived), may in such circumstances, forthwith collect, receive, appropriate and realize upon the Collateral, or any part thereof, and/or may forthwith sell, lease, assign, give option or options to purchase, or otherwise dispose of and deliver the Collateral or any part thereof (or contract to do any of the foregoing), in one or more parcels at public or private sale or sales, at any exchange, broker’s board or office of the Agent or any Secured Party or elsewhere upon such terms and conditions as it may deem advisable and at such prices as it may deem best, for cash or on credit or for future delivery without assumption of any credit risk. The Agent shall endeavor to provide the Borrower with notice at or about the time of the exercise of remedies in the proceeding sentence, provided that the failure to provide such notice shall not in any way compromise or adversely affect the exercise of such remedies or the Agent’s rights hereunder. The Agent or any Secured Party shall have the right upon any such public sale or sales, and, to the extent permitted by law, upon any such private sale or sales, to purchase the whole or any part of the Collateral so sold, free of any right or equity of redemption in any Grantor, which right or equity is hereby waived and released. Each Grantor further agrees, at the Agent’s request, to assemble the Collateral and make it available to the Agent at places which the Agent shall reasonably select, whether at such Grantor’s premises or elsewhere. The Agent shall apply the net proceeds of any action taken by it pursuant to this Section 6.05, after deducting all reasonable costs and expenses of every kind incurred in connection therewith or incidental to the care or safekeeping of any of the Collateral or in any way relating to the Collateral or the rights of the Agent and the Secured Parties hereunder, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and disbursements as provided in Section 9.04 of the Credit Agreement, to the payment in whole or in part of the Secured Obligations, in such order as is provided in Section 7.03 of the Credit Agreement, and only after such application and after the payment by the Agent of any other amount required by any provision of law, including, without limitation, Section 9-615(a)(3) of the New York UCC, need the Agent account for the surplus, if any, to any Grantor. To the extent permitted by applicable law, each Grantor waives all claims, damages and demands it may acquire against the Agent or any Secured Party arising out of the exercise by them of any rights hereunder. If any prior notice of a proposed sale or other disposition of Collateral shall be required by law, such notice shall be deemed reasonable and proper if given at least 10 days before such sale or other disposition.
 

13

 

 
The Agent shall incur no liability as a result of the sale of the Collateral, or any part thereof, at any private sale pursuant to this Article 6 conducted in accordance with the requirements of applicable laws and provided such sale shall not have resulted from the gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud of the Agent. Each Grantor hereby waives any claims against the Agent and the other Secured Parties arising by reason of the fact that the price at which the Collateral may have been sold at such a private sale was less than the price that might have been obtained at a public sale or was less than the aggregate amount of the Secured Obligations, even if the Agent accepts the first offer received and does not offer the Collateral to more than one offeree, provided that such private sale is conducted in accordance with applicable laws and this Agreement. Each Grantor hereby agrees that in respect of any sale of any of the Collateral pursuant to the terms hereof, the Agent is hereby authorized to comply with any limitation or restriction in connection with such sale as it may be advised by counsel is necessary in order to avoid any violation of applicable laws, or in order to obtain any required approval of the sale or of the purchaser by any governmental authority or official, nor shall the Agent be liable or accountable to any Grantor for any discount allowed by reason of the fact that such Collateral is sold in compliance with any such limitation or restriction.
 
Section 6.06.     Subordination. Each Grantor hereby agrees that, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, unless otherwise agreed by the Agent, all Indebtedness owing to it by the Borrower or any Subsidiary of the Borrower shall be fully subordinated to the indefeasible payment in full in cash of the Secured Obligations.
 
Section 6.07.     Deficiency. Each Grantor shall remain liable for any deficiency if the proceeds of any sale or other disposition of the Collateral are insufficient to pay the Secured Obligations and the fees and disbursements of any attorneys employed by the Agent or any Secured Party to collect such deficiency (which shall be limited to one (1) counsel, at any given time, to the Agent and one (1) additional counsel for all other Secured Parties taken as a whole, and if reasonably necessary, one (1) local counsel, at any given time, to the Agent in each relevant jurisdiction and one (1) additional local counsel for all other Secured Parties taken as a whole in each relevant jurisdiction (which may include a single special counsel acting in multiple jurisdictions).

The Agent shall endeavor to provide the Borrower with notice at or about the time of the exercise of its rights in the preceding clause (a), provided that the failure to provide such notice shall not in any way compromise or adversely affect the exercise of any rights or remedies hereunder.
 
(b)     If any Grantor fails to perform or comply with any of its agreements contained herein, the Agent, at its option, but without any obligation so to do, may perform or comply, or otherwise cause performance or compliance, with such agreement.
 
(c)     The expenses of the Agent incurred in connection with actions undertaken as provided in this Section 7.01, together with, if past due, interest thereon at a rate per annum equal to the interest rate applicable at such time to Base Rate Loans, from the date when due to the Agent to the date reimbursed by the relevant Grantor, shall be payable by such Grantor to the Agent upon not less than five (5) Business Days’ notice.
 
(d)     Each Grantor hereby ratifies all that said attorneys shall lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue hereof. All powers, authorizations and agencies contained in this Agreement are coupled with an interest and are irrevocable until this Agreement is terminated and the security interests created hereby are released.
 
Section 7.02.     Duty of Agent. Except for the safe custody of any Collateral in its possession and the accounting for moneys actually received by it hereunder, the Agent shall have no duty as to any Collateral or as to the taking of any necessary steps to preserve rights against prior parties or any other rights pertaining to any Collateral. Neither the Agent, any Secured Party nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees or agents shall be liable for failure to demand, collect or realize upon any of the Collateral or for any delay in doing so or shall be under any obligation to sell or otherwise dispose of any Collateral upon the request of any Grantor or any other Person or to take any other action whatsoever with regard to the Collateral or any part thereof. The powers conferred on the Agent and the Secured Parties hereunder are solely to protect the Agent’s and the Secured Parties’ interests in the Collateral and shall not impose any duty upon the Agent or any Secured Party to exercise any such powers. The Agent and the Secured Parties shall be accountable only for amounts that they actually receive as a result of the exercise of such powers, and neither they nor any of their officers, directors, employees or agents shall be responsible to any Grantor for any act or failure to act hereunder, except for their own gross negligence or willful misconduct.
 

16

 

 
Section 7.03.     Execution of Financing Statements. Pursuant to any applicable law, each Grantor authorizes the Agent to file or record financing statements and other filing or recording documents or instruments with respect to the Collateral without the signature of such Grantor in such form and in such offices as required by applicable law to perfect the security interests of the Agent under this Agreement. Each Grantor authorizes the Agent to use the collateral description “all personal property” or “all assets” in any such financing statements.

No failure to exercise, nor any delay in exercising, on the part of the Agent or any Secured Party, any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof. No single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. A waiver by the Agent or any Secured Party of any right or remedy hereunder on any one occasion shall not be construed as a bar to any right or remedy which the Agent or such Secured Party would otherwise have on any future occasion.

The Agent and each other Secured Party shall endeavor to notify the Borrower promptly of any such set-off and the application made by the Agent or such other Secured Party of the proceeds thereof, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application.

WHEREAS, the Agent is entering into the Joinder to the Amended and Restated Intercreditor Agreement dated as of the date hereof, pursuant to which the Agent becomes party to the Amended and Restated Intercreditor Agreement for the benefit of itself and the Lenders.

WHEREAS, pursuant to and under the Credit Agreement and the Security Agreement dated as of [_], 2018 (the “Security Agreement”) among the Grantors party thereto (together with any other entity that may become a party thereto) and the Administrative Agent, in its capacity as collateral agent (in such capacity, the “Agent”), the Grantor has agreed to enter into this Agreement in order to grant a security interest to the Agent in certain Intellectual Property as security for such loans and other obligations as more fully described herein; and
 
NOW, THEREFORE, intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:
 
1.     Defined Terms. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, (i) capitalized terms used in this Agreement shall have the respective meanings assigned to them in the Security Agreement and (ii) the rules of construction set forth in Section 1. 2 of the Credit Agreement and the comparable provisions of any other Loan Documents shall apply to this Agreement. Where applicable and except as otherwise expressly provided herein, terms used herein (whether or not capitalized) shall have the respective meanings assigned to them in the Uniform Commercial Code as enacted in New York as amended from time to time (the “Code”).
 
2.     To secure the full payment and performance of all Secured Obligations, the Grantor hereby grants to the Agent a security interest in the entire right, title and interest of such Grantor in and to all of its [Trademark/Patent/Copyrights], including those set forth on Schedule A; provided, however, that notwithstanding any of the other provisions set forth in this Section 2 (and notwithstanding any recording of the Agent’s Lien made in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, U.S. Copyright Office, or other registry office in any other jurisdiction), this Agreement shall not constitute a grant of a security interest in any property to the extent that such grant of a security interest is prohibited by any applicable Law of an Official Body, requires a consent not obtained of any Official Body pursuant to such Law or is prohibited by, or constitutes a breach or default under or results in the termination of or gives rise to any right of acceleration, modification or cancellation or requires any consent not obtained under, any contract, license, agreement, instrument or other document evidencing or giving rise to such property, except to the extent that such Law or the term in such contract, license, agreement, instrument or other document or similar agreement providing for such prohibition, breach, default or termination or requiring such consent is ineffective under applicable Law including Sections 9-406, 9-407, 9-408 or 9-409 of the New York UCC (or any successor provision or provisions); provided, further, that no security interest shall be granted in any United States “intent-to-use” trademark or service mark applications unless and until acceptable evidence of use of the trademark or service mark has been filed with and accepted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office pursuant to Section 1(c) or Section 1(d) of the Lanham Act (U.S.C. 1051, et seq.), and to the extent that, and solely during the period in which, the grant of a security interest therein would impair the validity or enforceability of such “intent-to-use” trademark or service mark applications under applicable federal Law. After such period and after such evidence of use has been filed and accepted, the Grantor acknowledges that such interest in such trademark or service mark applications will become part of the Collateral. The Agent agrees that, at the Grantor’s reasonable request and expense, it will provide such Grantor confirmation that the assets described in this paragraph are in fact excluded from the Collateral during such limited period only upon receipt of an Officer’s Certificate or an Opinion of Counsel to that effect.

No financing statement or other public notice with respect to all or any part of the Collateral is on file or of record in any public office, except as permitted pursuant to this Agreement or as permitted by the Credit Agreement and any other applicable Loan Documents;
 
4.     The Grantor agrees that, until all of the Secured Obligations shall have been indefeasibly satisfied in full, it will not enter into any agreement (for example, a license agreement) which is inconsistent with the Grantor’s obligations under this Agreement, without the Agent’s prior written consent which shall not be unreasonably withheld except that the Grantor may license technology in the ordinary course of business without the Agent’s consent to suppliers and customers to facilitate the manufacture and use of the Grantor’s products.
 
5.     The Agent shall have, in addition to all other rights and remedies given it by this Agreement and those rights and remedies set forth in the Security Agreement and the Credit Agreement and any other applicable Loan Documents, those allowed by applicable Law and the rights and remedies of a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code as enacted in any jurisdiction in which the Intellectual Property may be located and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, solely if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Agent may immediately, without demand of performance and without other notice (except as set forth below) or demand whatsoever to the Grantor, all of which are hereby expressly waived, and without advertisement, sell at public or private sale or otherwise realize upon, in a city that the Agent shall designate by notice to the Grantor, the whole or from time to time any part of the Intellectual Property, or any interest which the Grantor may have therein and, after deducting from the proceeds of sale or other disposition of the Intellectual Property all expenses (including fees and expenses for brokers and attorneys), shall apply the remainder of such proceeds toward the payment of the Secured Obligations as the Agent, in its sole discretion, shall determine. Any remainder of the proceeds after payment in full of the Secured Obligations shall be paid over to the Grantor. Notice of any sale or other disposition of the Intellectual Property shall be given to the Grantor at least ten (10) days before the time of any intended public or private sale or other disposition of the Intellectual Property is to be made, which the Grantor hereby agrees shall be reasonable notice of such sale or other disposition.

The Agent shall endeavor to provide the Grantor with notice at or about the time of the exercise of remedies in the preceding sentence, provided that the failure to provide such notice shall not in any way compromise or adversely affect the exercise of such remedies or the Agent’s rights hereunder.
 

 

 

 
6.      All of the Agent’s rights and remedies with respect to the Intellectual Property, whether established hereby, by the Security Agreement or by the Credit Agreement or any other applicable Loan Documents or by any other agreements or by Law, shall be cumulative and may be exercised singularly or concurrently. In the event of any irreconcilable inconsistency in the terms of this Agreement and the Security Agreement, the Security Agreement shall control.
 
7.      The provisions of this Agreement are severable, and if any clause or provision shall be held invalid and unenforceable in whole or in part in any jurisdiction, then such invalidity or unenforceability shall affect only such clause or provision, or part thereof, in such jurisdiction, and shall not in any manner affect such clause or provision in any other jurisdiction, or any clause or provision of this Agreement in any jurisdiction.

Nothing herein shall limit any Secured Party’s right to bring any suit, action or other proceeding against the Grantor or any of any of the Grantor’s assets or to serve process on the Grantor by any means authorized by Law.
 

 

 

 
11.     This Agreement may be executed by one or more of the parties to this Agreement on any number of separate counterparts (including by telecopy), and all of said counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same instrument.

7.     Additional Remedies Upon Event of Default.
 
Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default and while such Event of Default shall be continuing, the Agent shall have, in addition to all rights and remedies of a secured party under the Code or other applicable Law, and in addition to its rights under Section 6 above and under the other Loan Documents, the following rights and remedies, in each case subject to the Amended and Restated Intercreditor Agreement, any collateral agency agreement and any other intercreditor agreement entered into in connection with Indebtedness permitted under the Credit Agreement:
 
(a)     The Agent may, after ten (10) days’ advance notice to a Pledgor, sell, assign, give an option or options to purchase or otherwise dispose of such Pledgor’s Pledged Collateral or any part thereof at public or private sale, at any of the Agent’s offices or elsewhere, for cash, on credit or for future delivery, and upon such other terms as the Agent may deem commercially reasonable. Each Pledgor agrees that ten (10) days’ advance notice of the time and place of any public sale or the time after which any private sale is to be made shall constitute reasonable notification. The Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale of Pledged Collateral regardless of notice of sale having been given. The Agent may adjourn any public or private sale from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed therefor, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which it was so adjourned. Each Pledgor recognizes that the Agent may be compelled to resort to one or more private sales of the Pledged Collateral to a restricted group of purchasers who will be obliged to agree, among other things, to acquire such securities, shares, capital stock, member interests, partnership interests, investment property or ownership interests for their own account for investment and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof.
 
(b)     The proceeds of any collection, sale or other disposition of the Pledged Collateral, or any part thereof, shall, after the Agent has made all deductions of expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and disbursements as provided in Section 9.05 of the Credit Agreement, and other expenses incurred in connection with repossession, collection, sale or disposition of such Pledged Collateral or in connection with the enforcement of the Agent’s rights with respect to the Pledged Collateral, including in any insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization proceedings, be applied against the Secured Obligations, whether or not all the same be then due and payable, as provided in the Credit Agreement. The Agent shall incur no liability as a result of the sale of the Pledged Collateral, or any part thereof, at any private sale pursuant to this Section 7 conducted in accordance with the requirements of applicable laws and provided such sale shall not have resulted from the gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud of the Agent. Each Pledgor hereby waives any claims against the Agent and the other Secured Parties arising by reason of the fact that the price at which the Pledged Collateral may have been sold at such a private sale was less than the price that might have been obtained at a public sale or was less than the aggregate amount of the Secured Obligations, even if the Agent accepts the first offer received and does not offer the Pledged Collateral to more than one offeree, provided that such private sale is conducted in accordance with applicable laws and this Agreement. Each Pledgor hereby agrees that in respect of any sale of any of the Pledged Collateral pursuant to the terms hereof, the Agent is hereby authorized to comply with any limitation or restriction in connection with such sale as it may be advised by counsel is necessary in order to avoid any violation of applicable laws, or in order to obtain any required approval of the sale or of the purchaser by any governmental authority or official, nor shall the Agent be liable or accountable to any Pledgor for any discount allowed by reason of the fact that such Pledged Collateral is sold in compliance with any such limitation or restriction.

8.     Agent’s Duties.
 
The powers conferred on the Agent hereunder are solely to protect its interest (on behalf of itself and the Lenders) in the Pledged Collateral and shall not impose any duty upon it to exercise any such powers. Except for the safe custody of any Pledged Collateral in its possession and the accounting for moneys actually received by it hereunder, the Agent shall have no duty as to any Pledged Collateral or as to the taking of any necessary steps to preserve rights against prior parties or any other rights pertaining to any Pledged Collateral.
 
9.     Additional Pledgors.
 
It is anticipated that additional persons may from time to time become Subsidiaries of the Borrower or a Guarantor, each of whom will be required to join this Agreement as a Pledgor hereunder to the extent that such new Subsidiary is required to become a Guarantor under the Credit Agreement and owns equity interests in any other Person that is a Restricted Subsidiary. It is acknowledged and agreed that such new Subsidiaries of the Borrower or a Guarantor may become Pledgors hereunder and will be bound hereby simply by executing and delivering to the Agent a Supplemental Guarantee (in the form of Exhibit I to the Credit Agreement) and a Joinder Agreement in the form of Exhibit B to the Security Agreement. No notice of the addition of any Pledgor shall be required to be given to any pre-existing Pledgor, and each Pledgor hereby consents thereto.
 
10.     No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies.
 
No failure to exercise, and no delay in exercising, on the part of the Agent, any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder preclude any further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. No waiver of a single Event of Default shall be deemed a waiver of a subsequent Event of Default. The remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided under the other Loan Documents or by Law, rule or regulation and the Agent may enforce any one or more remedies hereunder successively or concurrently at its option. Each Pledgor waives any right to require the Agent to proceed against any other Person or to exhaust any of the Pledged Collateral or other security for the Secured Obligations or to pursue any remedy in the Agent’s power.
 
11.     Waivers.
 
Each Pledgor hereby waives any and all defenses which any Pledgor may now or hereafter have based on principles of suretyship, impairment of collateral, or the like and each Pledgor hereby waives any defense to or limitation on its obligations under this Agreement arising out of or based on any event or circumstance referred to in the immediately preceding Section hereof. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Pledgor hereby further waives each of the following:
 
(i)     All notices, disclosures and demands of any nature which otherwise might be required from time to time to preserve intact any rights against such Pledgor, including the following: any notice of any event or circumstance described in the immediately preceding Section hereof; any notice required by any law, regulation or order now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction; any notice of nonpayment, nonperformance, dishonor, or protest under any Loan Document or any of the Secured Obligations; any notice of the incurrence of any Secured Obligation; any notice of any default or any failure on the part of such Pledgor or the Borrower or any other Person to comply with any Loan Document or any of the Secured Obligations or any requirement pertaining to any direct or indirect security for any of the Secured Obligations; and any notice or other information pertaining to the business, operations, condition (financial or otherwise), or prospects of the Borrower or any other Person;

(ii)     Any right to any marshalling of assets, to the filing of any claim against such Pledgor or the Borrower or any other Person in the event of any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, or similar proceeding, or to the exercise against such Pledgor or the Borrower, or any other Person of any other right or remedy under or in connection with any Loan Document or any of the Secured Obligations or any direct or indirect security for any of the Secured Obligations; any requirement of promptness or diligence on the part of the Agent, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders or any other Person; any requirement to exhaust any remedies under or in connection with, or to mitigate the damages resulting from default under, any Loan Document or any of the Secured Obligations or any direct or indirect security for any of the Secured Obligations; any benefit of any statute of limitations; and any requirement of acceptance of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, and any requirement that any Pledgor receive notice of any such acceptance; and
 
(iii)     Any defense or other right arising by reason of any Law now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction pertaining to election of remedies (including anti-deficiency laws, “one action” laws, or the like), or by reason of any election of remedies or other action or inaction by the Agent, the Administrative Agent or the Lenders (including commencement or completion of any judicial proceeding or nonjudicial sale or other action in respect of collateral security for any of the Secured Obligations), which results in denial or impairment of the right of the Agent, the Administrative Agent or the Lenders to seek a deficiency against the Borrower or any other Person or which otherwise discharges or impairs any of the Secured Obligations.
 
12.     Assignment.
 
All rights of the Agent under this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of its successors and assigns. All obligations of each Pledgor shall bind its successors and assigns; provided, however, that no Pledgor may assign or transfer any of its rights and obligations hereunder or any interest herein, and any such purported assignment or transfer shall be null and void.
 
13.     Severability.
 
Any provision (or portion thereof) of this Agreement which shall be held invalid or unenforceable shall be ineffective without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof (or portions thereof).
 
14.     Governing Law.

17.     Voting Rights in Respect of the Pledged Collateral.
 
So long as no Event of Default shall occur and be continuing under the Credit Agreement, each Pledgor may exercise any and all voting and other consensual rights pertaining to the Pledged Collateral or any part thereof for any purpose not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents; provided, however, that such Pledgor will not exercise or will refrain from exercising any such voting and other consensual right pertaining to the Pledged Collateral, as the case may be, if such action would have a material adverse effect on the value of any Pledged Collateral. At any time and from time to time, after and during the continuation of an Event of Default, no Pledgor shall be permitted to exercise any of its respective voting and other consensual rights whatsoever pertaining to the Pledged Collateral or any part thereof; provided, however, in addition to the other rights with respect to the Pledged Collateral granted to the Agent, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders for the benefit of itself and the Lenders, hereunder, at any time and from time to time, after and during the continuation of an Event of Default and subject to the Amended and Restated Intercreditor Agreement, any collateral agency agreement and any other intercreditor agreement entered into in connection with Indebtedness permitted under the Credit Agreement, the Agent may exercise any and all voting and other consensual rights of each and every Pledgor pertaining to the Pledged Collateral or any part thereof.

ARTICLE VI     

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE PURCHASERS 
 
Each Purchaser, severally for itself only and not with respect to any other Purchaser, hereby represents and warrants to the Issuer and each of the Guarantors that:
 
6.01     Nature of Purchase. It is acquiring the Additional 10.5% Notes for investment, solely for its own account (or for the account of those for whom or for which, as the case may be, it is acting as investment advisor, sub-advisor, manager or in a similar capacity) and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, the distribution thereof in violation of applicable securities laws. Such Purchaser will not resell, transfer, assign or distribute the Additional 10.5% Notes acquired by it, except in compliance with this Agreement, the registration requirements of the Securities Act, and applicable state securities laws or pursuant to an available exemption therefrom.
 

11

 

 
6.02     No Registration. Such Purchaser understands that it must bear the economic risk of its investment for an indefinite period of time because the Additional 10.5% Notes will not be registered under the Securities Act or any applicable state securities laws and may not be resold unless subsequently registered under the Securities Act or unless an exemption from such registration is available. Such Purchaser further understands that the exemption from registration afforded by Rule 144 depends on the satisfaction of various conditions, and that, if applicable, Rule 144 may afford the basis for sales only in limited amounts. Such Purchaser acknowledges that the Issuer is relying on the representations and warranties of such Purchaser in this Article VI and such Purchaser agrees to notify any subsequent purchaser of the Additional 10.5% Notes from it of the resale restrictions referred to herein, as applicable. Such Purchaser, also acknowledges that there is no established public market for the Additional 10.5% Notes and there can be no assurance that there will be any public market for the Additional 10.5% Notes in the foreseeable future. Each Purchaser acknowledges that the Additional 10.5% Notes shall bear legends upon issuance and as and when required by the Indenture.
 
6.03     Power and Authority. Such Purchaser has all requisite power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to carry out the transactions contemplated by, and perform its respective obligations under, this Agreement.
 
6.04     Authorization. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the performance of its obligations hereunder have been duly authorized by all necessary action on its part. This Agreement is the legally valid and binding obligation of it and enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by the Enforceability Exceptions.
 
6.05     No Conflicts. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by such Purchaser, compliance by such Purchaser with all provisions hereof and thereof and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby will not (i) conflict with or constitute a breach of any of the terms or provisions of the charter, by-laws or other organizational documents of such Purchaser, (ii) conflict with or constitute a breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or a default under, any indenture, loan agreement, mortgage, lease or other agreement or instrument that is material to such Purchaser, to which such Purchaser is a party or by which such Purchaser or its respective property is bound, or (iii) violate or conflict with any applicable law or any rule, regulation, judgment, order or decree of any court or any governmental body or agency having jurisdiction over such Purchaser or its property, except in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), for such conflicts, breaches or defaults that would not, singly or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on such Purchaser’s ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement.
 
6.06     Governmental Consents. The execution, delivery and performance by it of this Agreement do not and will not require any registration or filing with, consent or approval of, or notice to, or other action to, with or by, any federal, state or other governmental authority or regulatory body, assuming the accuracy of the representations of the Issuer and Hovnanian in Article V hereof and the Purchasers’ representations in Article VI hereof, other than any filings with the SEC required to be made by the Issuer and Hovnanian.

6.08     Investment Experience. Each Purchaser is an “Accredited Investor” (as such term is defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act) and a “Qualified Institutional Buyer” (as such term is defined in Rule 144A promulgated under the Securities Act). It is a sophisticated institutional investor and its knowledge and experience in financial and business matters is such that it, together with the assistance of professional and legal advisors of its choosing, is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of an investment in the Additional 10.5% Notes.

3.


Indenture; Liens; Guarantees.



 
This is one of the 10.500% Senior Secured Notes due 2024 issued under an Indenture dated as of July 27, 2017 (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the “Indenture”), among the Issuer, the Guarantors party thereto, the Trustee and the Collateral Agent. The terms of the Notes include those stated in the Indenture and only those expressly made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act, and Holders are referred to the Indenture and the Trust Indenture Act for a statement of such terms. To the extent permitted by applicable law, in the event of any inconsistency between the terms of this Note and the terms of the Indenture, the terms of the Indenture will control.

The Notes are general obligations of the Issuer, secured by Liens on the Collateral as described in the Indenture and the Security Documents. The Indenture limits the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes issued thereunder to $400,000,000 but Additional Notes of the same series may be issued pursuant to the Indenture (subject to the conditions stated therein), and the originally issued Notes and all such Additional Notes vote together for all purposes as a single class. This Note is guaranteed by the Guarantors as set forth in the Indenture and the Guarantee endorsed hereon.
 
Reference is hereby made to the Indenture for a statement of the respective rights, duties and obligations thereunder of the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee, the Collateral Agent and the Holders.

Optional Redemption; Redemption with Proceeds of Equity Offering.



 
(a)     The Issuer may, at its option, redeem the Notes, in whole, at any time, or in part, from time to time, prior to July 15, 2020, at a redemption price equal to the sum of:
 
(i)     100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but excluding, the redemption date, if any (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant Record Date to receive interest on the relevant Interest Payment Date); plus
 
(ii)     the Make-Whole Amount.

Defaults and Remedies.



 
If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the Notes may declare all the Notes to be due and payable immediately. If a bankruptcy or insolvency default with respect to the Issuer or the Company occurs and is continuing, the Notes automatically become immediately due and payable. Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture. The Trustee may require reasonable indemnity or security satisfactory to it before it enforces the Indenture or the Notes. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding may direct the Trustee in its exercise of remedies; provided, that for purposes of directing the Collateral Agent with respect to the Collateral under Section 5.4(b) of the Indenture, Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes and the Issuer’s 10.000% Senior Secured Notes due 2022 then outstanding shall vote, act and be treated together as a single series for purposes of Section 5.4(b) of the Indenture and the determination of such majority.
 



11.


Amendment, Supplement and Waiver.



 
Subject to certain exceptions, the Indenture, the Notes, the Guarantees and the Security Documents may be amended or supplemented, or future compliance therewith may be waived, with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes. Without notice to or the consent of any Holder, the Company, the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee, the Collateral Agent, the Joint Collateral Agent and the Mortgage Tax Collateral Agent, as applicable, may amend or supplement the Indenture, the Notes, the Guarantees or the Security Documents to, among other things, cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency or if such amendment or supplement does not adversely affect the legal rights of any Holder. Without the consent of the Holders of at least 66⅔% in principal amount of the Notes, the Company, the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee, the Collateral Agent, the Joint Collateral Agent and the Mortgage Tax Collateral Agent may not effect a release of all or substantially all of the Collateral other than pursuant to the terms of the Security Documents or as otherwise permitted under the Indenture. 
 



12.


Trustee Dealings With Issuer.
