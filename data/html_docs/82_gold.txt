interest at a rate determined by reference to the Alternate Base Rate.  Adjusted LIBO Rate means, with respect to any

administrative agent for the Lenders hereunder.  Administrative Questionnaire means an Administrative Questionnaire in
a form supplied by the Administrative Agent.  Affiliate means, with respect to a specified Person, another Person that

Agent Party has the meaning assigned to such term in Section 9.01(d). 
Aggregate Commitment means the aggregate of the Commitments of all of the Lenders, as reduced or increased from time to
time pursuant to the terms and conditions hereof. As of the Effective Date, the Aggregate Commitment is $700,000,000.  Aggregate

date of such determination, exceeding $50,000,000. For purposes of the calculations to be made pursuant to the preceding sentence, (i) any Immaterial Subsidiary having negative gross revenues for any relevant period shall be deemed to have

irrevocable written notice (via a written Borrowing Request signed by such Borrower, or the Company on its behalf) four (4) Business Days (in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in a Foreign Currency), in each case before the date
of the proposed Borrowing or (b) by telephone in the case of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time on the date of the proposed Borrowing. Each such telephonic Borrowing Request shall be irrevocable and shall be
confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Borrowing Request signed by the applicable Borrower, or the Company on behalf of the applicable Borrower. Each such telephonic and written Borrowing Request
shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:  (i) the name of the applicable Borrower;
 (ii) the aggregate amount of the requested Borrowing; 
(iii) the date of such Borrowing, which shall be a Business Day; 
(iv) whether such Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurocurrency Borrowing; 
  28 


(v) in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, the Agreed Currency and initial
Interest Period to be applicable thereto, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term Interest Period; and 
(vi) the location and number of the applicable Borrowers account to which funds are to be disbursed, which shall comply
with the requirements of Section 2.07.  If no election as to the Type of Revolving Borrowing is specified, then, in the case of a Borrowing
denominated in Dollars, the requested Revolving Borrowing shall be an ABR Borrowing. If no Interest Period is specified with respect to any requested Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing, then the relevant Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an
Interest Period of one months duration. Promptly following receipt of a Borrowing Request in accordance with this Section, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of the amount of such Lenders Loan to
be made as part of the requested Borrowing.  SECTION 2.04. Determination of Dollar Amounts. The Administrative Agent will
determine the Dollar Amount of:  (a) each Eurocurrency Borrowing as of the date two (2) Business Days prior to the
date of such Borrowing or, if applicable, the date of conversion/continuation of any Borrowing as a Eurocurrency Borrowing, 
(b) the LC Exposure as of the date of each request for the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit,
and  (c) all outstanding Credit Events on and as of the last Business Day of each calendar quarter and, during the
continuation of an Event of Default, on any other Business Day elected by the Administrative Agent in its discretion or upon instruction by the Required Lenders. 
Each day upon or as of which the Administrative Agent determines Dollar Amounts as described in the preceding clauses (a), (b) and (c) is
herein described as a Computation Date with respect to each Credit Event for which a Dollar Amount is determined on or as of such day. 
SECTION 2.05. Swingline Loans. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Swingline Lender agrees to make
Swingline Loans in Dollars to the Company from time to time during the Availability Period, in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding that will not result in (i) the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Swingline Loans
exceeding $50,000,000 or (ii) the Dollar Amount of the total Revolving Credit Exposures exceeding the Aggregate Commitment; provided that the Swingline Lender shall not be required to make a Swingline Loan to refinance an outstanding
Swingline Loan. Within the foregoing limits and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Company may borrow, prepay and reborrow Swingline Loans. 
(b) To request a Swingline Loan, the Company shall notify the Administrative Agent of such request by telephone (confirmed by
telecopy), not later than 1:00 p.m., New York City time, on the day of a proposed Swingline Loan. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the requested date (which shall be a Business Day) and amount of the requested Swingline Loan.
The Administrative Agent will promptly advise the Swingline Lender of any such notice received from the Company. The Swingline Lender shall make each Swingline Loan available to the Company by means of a credit to the general deposit account of the
Company with the Swingline Lender (or, in the case of a Swingline Loan made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.06(e), by remittance to the Issuing Bank) by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the
requested date of such Swingline Loan. 
  29 


(c) The Swingline Lender may by written notice given to the Administrative Agent
not later than 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on any Business Day require the Lenders to acquire participations on such Business Day in all or a portion of the Swingline Loans outstanding. Such notice shall specify the aggregate amount of
Swingline Loans in which Lenders will participate. Promptly upon receipt of such notice, the Administrative Agent will give notice thereof to each Lender, specifying in such notice such Lenders Applicable Percentage of such Swingline Loan or
Loans. Each Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees, upon receipt of notice as provided above, to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Swingline Lender, such Lenders Applicable Percentage of such Swingline Loan
or Loans. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations in Swingline Loans pursuant to this paragraph is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including the
occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Each Lender shall comply with its obligation under
this paragraph by wire transfer of immediately available funds, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.07 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.07 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment
obligations of the Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the Swingline Lender the amounts so received by it from the Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall notify (such notice, the Swingline Participation
Notice) the Company of any participations in any Swingline Loan acquired pursuant to this paragraph, and, subject to the last sentence of this paragraph, thereafter payments in respect of such Swingline Loan shall be made to the
Administrative Agent and not to the Swingline Lender. Any amounts received by the Swingline Lender from the Company (or other party on behalf of the Company) in respect of a Swingline Loan after receipt by the Swingline Lender of the proceeds of a
sale of participations therein shall be promptly remitted to the Administrative Agent; any such amounts received by the Administrative Agent shall be promptly remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Lenders that shall have made their payments
pursuant to this paragraph and to the Swingline Lender, as their interests may appear; provided that any such payment so remitted shall be repaid to the Swingline Lender or to the Administrative Agent, as applicable, if and to the extent such
payment is required to be refunded to the Company for any reason. The purchase of participations in a Swingline Loan pursuant to this paragraph shall not relieve the Company of any default in the payment thereof. Notwithstanding the preceding three
sentences, upon the Companys receipt of the Swingline Participation Notice, the Company request the Administrative Agent in writing to convert the applicable Swingline Loan into an ABR Revolving Loan and, promptly after receipt of such written
request, the Administrative Agent shall effect such conversion and thereafter such Swingline Loan shall be deemed to be an ABR Revolving Loan hereunder. 
SECTION 2.06. Letters of Credit. (a) General. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Company may
request the issuance of Letters of Credit denominated in Agreed Currencies as the applicant thereof for the support of its or its Subsidiaries obligations, in a form reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank, at
any time and from time to time during the Availability Period. In the event of any inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any form of letter of credit application or other agreement submitted
by the Company to, or entered into by the Company with, the Issuing Bank relating to any Letter of Credit, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control. The letters of credit identified on Schedule 2.06 and the letters of
credit issued and outstanding on the Effective Date under the Existing Credit Agreement (collectively, the Existing Letters of Credit) shall be deemed to be 
  30 



Letters of Credit issued on the Effective Date for all purposes of the Loan Documents. The Company unconditionally and irrevocably agrees that, in connection with any Letter of Credit
issued for the support of any Subsidiarys obligations as provided in the first sentence of this paragraph, the Company will be fully responsible for the reimbursement of LC Disbursements in accordance with the terms hereof, the payment of
interest thereon and the payment of fees due under Section 2.12(b) to the same extent as if it were the sole account party in respect of such Letter of Credit (the Company hereby irrevocably waiving any defenses that might otherwise be
available to it as a guarantor or surety of the obligations of such a Subsidiary that is an account party in respect of any such Letter of Credit). 
(b) Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Renewal, Extension; Certain Conditions. To request the issuance of a Letter of Credit
(or the amendment, renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit), the Company shall hand deliver or telecopy (or transmit by electronic communication, if arrangements for doing so have been approved by the Issuing Bank) to the Issuing
Bank and the Administrative Agent (reasonably in advance of the requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension) a notice requesting the issuance of a Letter of Credit, or identifying the Letter of Credit to be amended, renewed or
extended, and specifying the date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (which shall be a Business Day), the date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall comply with paragraph (c) of this Section), the amount of such
Letter of Credit, the Agreed Currency applicable thereto, the name and address of the beneficiary thereof and such other information as shall be necessary to prepare, amend, renew or extend such Letter of Credit. If requested by the Issuing Bank,
the Company also shall submit a letter of credit application on the Issuing Banks standard form in connection with any request for a Letter of Credit. A Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended, renewed or extended only if (and upon issuance,
amendment, renewal or extension of each Letter of Credit 

b), the sum of the Dollar Amount of the total Revolving Credit Exposures shall not exceed the Aggregate Commitment and (iii) subject to
Sections 2.04 and 2.11(b), the Dollar Amount of the total outstanding Revolving Loans and LC Exposure, in each case denominated in Foreign Currencies, shall not exceed the Foreign Currency Sublimit. 
(c) Expiration Date. (A) Each Letter of Credit shall expire (or be subject to termination by notice from the
Issuing Bank to the beneficiary thereof) at or prior to the close of business on the earlier of (i) subject to Section 2.06(c)(B), the date one year after the date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or
extension thereof, one year after such renewal or extension), unless (1) the face amount of the requested Letter of Credit, when taken together with the face amount of all other Letters of Credit with expiry dates longer than twelve months from
the date of issuance, does not exceed $10,000,000 or (2) the Required Lenders have approved such expiry date (provided that in any case with respect to clauses (1) and (2) the expiry date must be no later than the date set
forth in Section 2.06(c)(A)(ii)) and (ii) the date that is five (5) Business Days prior to the Maturity Date. 
(B) If the Company so requests in any applicable Letter of Credit application, the Issuing Bank agrees to issue a Letter of
Credit that has automatic extension provisions (each, an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit); provided that any such Auto-Extension Letter of Credit must permit the Issuing Bank to prevent any such extension at least once in each
twelve-month period (commencing with the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit) by giving prior notice to the beneficiary thereof not later than a day (the Non-Extension Notice Date) in each such twelve-month period to be
agreed upon at the time such Letter of Credit is issued. Unless otherwise directed by the Issuing Bank, the Company shall not be required to make a specific request to the 
  31 



Issuing Bank for any such extension. Once an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit has been issued, the Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) the Issuing Bank to permit the
extension of such Letter of Credit at any time to an expiry date not later than the date set forth in Section 2.06(c)(A)(ii); provided, however, that the Issuing Bank shall not permit any such extension if (1) the Issuing
Bank has determined that it would not be permitted, or would have no obligation, at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its revised form (as extended) under the terms hereof (by reason of the provisions of Section 2.06(c) or otherwise),
or (2) it has received notice (which may be by telephone or in writing) on or before the day that is five (5) Business Days before the Non-Extension Notice Date (I) from the Administrative Agent that the Required Lenders have elected
not to permit such extension or (II) from the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Company that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in Section 4.02 is not then satisfied, and in each such case directing the Issuing Bank not to
permit such extension.  (d) Participations. By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of
Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without any further action on the part of the Issuing Bank or the Lenders, the Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Lender, and each Lender hereby acquires from the Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter
of Credit equal to such Lenders Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to
pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Issuing Bank, such Lenders Applicable Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by the Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the Company on the date due as provided in paragraph (e) of
this Section, or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the Company for any reason. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is
absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments,
and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.  (e)
Reimbursement. If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the Company shall reimburse such LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent in Dollars the Dollar Amount equal to such LC
Disbursement, calculated as of the date the Issuing Bank made such LC Disbursement (or if the Issuing Bank shall so elect in its sole discretion by notice to the Company, in such other Agreed Currency which was paid by the Issuing Bank pursuant to
such LC Disbursement in an amount equal to such LC Disbursement) not later than 12:00 noon, Local Time, on the date that such LC Disbursement is made, if the Company shall have received notice of such LC Disbursement prior to 10:00 a.m., Local
Time, on such date, or, if such notice has not been received by the Company prior to such time on such date, then not later than 12:00 noon, Local Time, on the Business Day immediately following the day that the Company receives such notice;
provided that the Company may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Section 2.03 or 2.05 that such payment be financed with (i) to the extent such LC Disbursement was made in Dollars,
an ABR Revolving Borrowing, Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing or Swingline Loan in Dollars in an amount equal to such LC Disbursement or (ii) to the extent that such LC Disbursement was made in a Foreign Currency, a Eurocurrency Revolving
Borrowing in such Foreign Currency in an amount equal to such LC Disbursement and, in each case, to the extent so financed, the Companys obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting ABR Revolving Borrowing,
Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing or Swingline Loan, as applicable. If the Company fails to make such payment when due, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the

  32 



Company in respect thereof and such Lenders Applicable Percentage thereof. Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent its Applicable
Percentage of the payment then due from the Company, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.07 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.07 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the
Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment from the Company pursuant to this paragraph, the
Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the Issuing Bank or, to the extent that Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Bank, then to such Lenders and the Issuing Bank as their interests may
appear. Any payment made by a Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement (other than the funding of Revolving Loans or a Swingline Loan as contemplated above) shall not constitute a Loan and shall not
relieve the Company of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement. If the Companys reimbursement of, or obligation to reimburse, any amounts in any Foreign Currency would subject the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender
to any stamp duty, ad valorem charge or similar tax that would not be payable if such reimbursement were made or required to be made in Dollars, the Company shall, at its option, either (x) pay the amount of any such tax requested by the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the relevant Lender or (y) reimburse each LC Disbursement made in such Foreign Currency in Dollars, in an amount equal to the Equivalent Amount, calculated using the applicable Exchange Rates, on the
date such LC Disbursement is made, of such LC Disbursement.  (f) Obligations Absolute. The Companys obligation
to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances
whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be
forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by the Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply
with the terms of such Letter of Credit, or (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or
provide a right of setoff against, the Companys obligations hereunder. Neither the Administrative Agent, the Lenders nor the Issuing Bank, nor any of their Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in
connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or
delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder) or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the
Issuing Bank; provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the Issuing Bank from liability to the Company to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages, claims in
respect of which are hereby waived by the Company to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Company that are caused by (x) the I

n the part of the Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent

  33 



jurisdiction), the Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree
that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without
responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit. 
(g) Disbursement Procedures. The Issuing Bank shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents
purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. The Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Company by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether the Issuing Bank has
made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; provided that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Company of its obligation to reimburse the Issuing Bank and the Lenders with respect to any such LC
Disbursement.  (h) Interim Interest. If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless the Company
shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is required to be reimbursed, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the
date that the Company reimburses such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Revolving Loans (or in the case such LC Disbursement is denominated in a Foreign Currency, at the Overnight Foreign Currency Rate for such Agreed
Currency plus the then effective Applicable Rate with respect to Eurocurrency Revolving Loans); provided that, if the Company fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section, then
Section 2.13(c) shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section to
reimburse the Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment.  (i) Replacement of
Issuing Bank. The Issuing Bank may be replaced at any time by written agreement among the Company, the Administrative Agent, the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such
replacement of the Issuing Bank. At the time any such replacement shall become effective, the Company shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.12(b). From and after the effective date
of any such replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of the Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term
Issuing Bank shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After the replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced
Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit then outstanding and issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not
be required to issue additional Letters of Credit.  (j) Cash Collateralization. If any Event of Default shall occur
and be continuing, on the Business Day that the Company receives notice from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total
LC Exposure) demanding the deposit of cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph, the Company shall deposit in an account with the Administrative Agent, in the name of the Administrative Agent and for the benefit of the Lenders

  34 



(the LC Collateral Account), an amount in cash equal to 102% of the Dollar Amount of the LC Exposure as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon;
provided that (i) the portions of such amount attributable to undrawn Foreign Currency Letters of Credit or LC Disbursements in a Foreign Currency that the Company is not late in reimbursing shall be deposited in the applicable Foreign
Currencies in the actual amounts of such undrawn Letters of Credit and LC Disbursements and (ii) the obligation to deposit such cash collateral shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due and payable,
without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the Company Section 7.01(f). For the purposes of this paragraph, the Foreign Currency LC Exposure shall be calculated using the applicable
Exchange Rate on the date notice demanding cash collateralization is delivered to the Company. The Company also shall deposit cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph as and to the extent required by Section 2.11(b). Such deposit shall be
held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the Obligations. The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account. Other than any
interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the Administrative Agent and at the Companys risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits,
if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the Issuing Bank for LC Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so
applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Company for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of Lenders with LC Exposure representing
greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure), be applied to satisfy other Obligations. If the Company is required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default or pursuant to
Section 2.11(b), such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Company within three (3) Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured or waived or, in the case of Section 2.11(b), after the
applicable exposure no longer exceeds the applicable commitment or sublimit.  SECTION 2.07. Funding of Borrowings.
(a) Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds (i) in the case of Loans denominated in Dollars, by 1:00 p.m., New York City time, to the account
of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders and (ii) in the case of each Loan denominated in a Foreign Currency, by 12:00 noon, Local Time, in the city of the Administrative Agents
Eurocurrency Payment Office for such currency and at such Eurocurrency Payment Office for such currency; provided that Swingline Loans shall be made as provided in Section 2.05. The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to
the relevant Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to (x) an account of such Borrower maintained with the Administrative Agent in New York City or Chicago and designated by such Borrower in the applicable
Borrowing Request, in the case of Loans denominated in Dollars and (y) an account of such Borrower in the relevant jurisdiction and designated by such Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request, in the case of Loans denominated in a Foreign
Currency; provided that Revolving Loans made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.06(e) shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Issuing Bank. 
(b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing (or in
the case of an ABR Borrowing, prior to 1:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date of such Borrowing) that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lenders share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume
that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with 
  35 



paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the relevant Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its
share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and such Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each
day from and including the date such amount is made available to such Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate
determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation (including without limitation the Overnight Foreign Currency Rate in the case of Loans denominated in a Foreign Currency) or (ii) in the
case of such Borrower, the interest rate applicable to such Borrowing. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lenders Loan included in such Borrowing. 
SECTION 2.08. Interest Elections. (a) Each Revolving Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable
Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the relevant Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing to a different Type or to
continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section. A Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected
Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing. This Section shall not apply to
Swingline Borrowings, which may not be converted or continued.  (b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, a
Borrower, or the Company on its behalf, shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election (by telephone or irrevocable written notice in the case of a Borrowing denominated in Dollars or by irrevocable written notice (via an Interest Election
Request signed by such Borrower, or the Company on its behalf) in the case of a Borrowing denominated in a Foreign Currency) by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if such Borrower were requesting a Revolving
Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election. Each such telephonic Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the
Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election Request signed by the relevant Borrower, or the Company on its behalf. Notwithstanding any contrary provision herein, this Section shall not be construed to permit any Borrower to (i) change
the currency of any Borrowing, (ii) elect an Interest Period for Eurocurrency Loans that does not comply with Section 2.02(d) or (iii) convert any Borrowing to a Borrowing of a Type not available under such Borrowing. 
(c) Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with
Section 2.02:  (i) the name of the applicable Borrower and the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request
applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and
(iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing);  (ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to
such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day; 
  36 


(iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurocurrency
Borrowing; and  (iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurocurrency Borrowing, the Interest Period and Agreed Currency to be
applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which Interest Period shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term Interest Period. 
If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurocurrency Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the applicable Borrower shall be deemed
to have selected an Interest Period of one months duration.  (d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election
Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such Lenders portion of each resulting Borrowing. 
(e) If the relevant Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurocurrency Revolving
Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period (i) in the case of a Borrowing denominated in Dollars, such Borrowing shall be
converted to an ABR Borrowing and (ii) in the case of a Borrowing denominated in a Foreign Currency in respect of which the applicable Borrower shall have failed to deliver an Interest Election Request prior to the third (3rd) Business Day preceding the end of such Interest Period, such Borrowing shall automatically continue as a Eurocurrency Borrowing in the same Agreed Currency with an Interest Period of one month
unless such Eurocurrency Borrowing is or was repaid in accordance with Section 2.11. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the
Required Lenders, so notifies the Company, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Revolving Borrowing denominated in Dollars may be converted to or continued as a Eurocurrency Borrowing, (ii) unless repaid,
each Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing denominated in Dollars shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto and (iii) unless repaid, each Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing denominated in a Foreign
Currency shall automatically be continued as a Eurocurrency Borrowing with an Interest Period of one month.  SECTION 2.09.
Termination and Reduction of Commitments. (a) Unless previously terminated, the Commitments shall terminate on the Maturity Date. 
(b) The Company may at any time terminate, or from time to time reduce, the Commitments; provided that (i) each
reduction of the Commitments shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $1,000,000 and (ii) the Company shall not terminate or reduce the Commitments if, after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment
of the Loans in accordance with Section 2.11, the Dollar Amount of the sum of the Revolving Credit Exposures would exceed the Aggregate Commitment. 
(c) The Company shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the Commitments under
paragraph (b) of this Section at least three (3) Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date thereof. Promptly following receipt of any notice, the
Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the Company pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable; provided that a notice of termination of the Commitments

  37 



delivered by the Company may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities or the occurrence of any one or more other transactions specified therein, in
which case such notice may be revoked by the Company (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the Commitments shall be permanent. Each
reduction of the Commitments shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments.  SECTION 2.10.
Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt. (a) Each Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Revolving Loan made to such
Borrower on the Maturity Date in the currency of such Loan and (ii) in the case of the Company, to the Swingline Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Swingline Loan on the earlier of the Maturity Date and the first date after such
Swingline Loan is made that is the 15th or last day of a calendar month and is at least two (2) Business Days after such Swingline Loan is made; provided that on each date that a
Revolving Borrowing is made, the Company shall repay all Swingline Loans then outstanding.  (b) Each Lender shall maintain
in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of each Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender
from time to time hereunder.  (c) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall record (i) the
amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Class, Agreed Currency and Type thereof and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from each Borrower to each
Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lenders share thereof. 
(d) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section shall be
prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner
affect the Obligations.  (e) Any Lender may request that Loans made by it to any Borrower be evidenced by a promissory
note. In such event, the relevant Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to the order of such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) and in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit I. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 9.04) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form
payable to the order of the payee named therein (or, if any such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns). 
SECTION 2.11. Prepayment of Loans. 
(a) Any Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing in whole or in part without
premium or penalty but subject to break funding payments pursuant to Section 2.16, subject to prior notice in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.11(a). The applicable Borrower, or the Company on behalf of the applicable
Borrower, shall notify the Administrative Agent (and, in the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, the Swingline Lender) by written notice (promptly followed by telephonic confirmation of such request) of any prepayment hereunder (i) in the
case of prepayment of a Eurocurrency 
  38 



Revolving Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., Local Time, three (3) Business Days (in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in Dollars) or four (4) Business Days (in
the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in a Foreign Currency), in each case before the date of prepayment, (ii) in the case of prepayment of an ABR Revolving Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the date
of prepayment or (iii) in the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date of prepayment. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date and the principal amount
of each Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid; provided that, if a notice of prepayment is given in connection with a conditional notice of termination of the Commitments as contemplated by Section 2.09, then such notice of
prepayment may be revoked if such notice of termination is revoked in accordance with Section 2.09. Promptly following receipt of any such notice relating to a Revolving Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the
contents thereof. Each partial prepayment of any Revolving Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of an advance of a Revolving Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section 2.02. Each prepayment of a Revolving
Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments shall be accompanied by (i) accrued interest to the extent required by Section 2.13 and (ii) break funding payments pursuant to
Section 2.16.  (b) If at any time, (i) other than as a result of fluctuations in currency exchange rates,
(A) the sum of the aggregate principal Dollar Amount of all of the Revolving Credit Exposures (calculated, with respect to those Credit Events denominated in Foreign Currencies, as of the most recent Computation Date with respect to each such
Credit Event) exceeds the Aggregate Commitment or (B) the sum of the aggregate principal Dollar Amount of all of the outstanding Revolving Credit Exposures denominated in Foreign Currencies (the Foreign Currency Exposure) (so
calculated), as of the most recent Computation Date with respect to each such Credit Event, exceeds the Foreign Currency Sublimit or (ii) solely as a result of fluctuations in currency exchange rates, (A) the sum of the aggregate principal
Dollar Amount of all of the Revolving Credit Exposures (so calculated) exceeds 105% of the Aggregate Commitment or (B) the Foreign Currency Exposure, as of the most recent Computation Date with respect to each such Credit Event, exceeds 105% of
the Foreign Currency Sublimit, the Borrowers shall in each case immediately repay Borrowings or cash collateralize LC Exposure in an account with the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 2.06(j), as applicable, in an aggregate principal
amount sufficient to cause (x) the aggregate Dollar Amount of all Revolving Credit Exposures (so calculated) to be less than or equal to the Aggregate Commitment and (y) the Foreign Currency Exposure to be less than or equal to the Foreign
Currency Sublimit, as applicable.  SECTION 2.12. Fees. (a) Subject to Section 2.24, the Company agrees to pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a facility fee, which shall accrue at the applicable Facility Fee Rate (as specified in the definition of Applicable Rate) on the daily amount of the Commitment of such Lender (whether used or
unused) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the date on which such Commitment terminates; provided that, if such Lender continues to have any Revolving Credit Exposure after its Commitment terminates, then
such facility fee shall continue to accrue on the daily amount of such Lenders Revolving Credit Exposure from and including the date on which its Commitment terminates to but excluding the date on which such Lender ceases to have any Revolving
Credit Exposure. Accrued facility fees shall be payable in arrears on the last day of March, June, September and December of each year and on the date on which the Commitments terminate, commencing on the first such date to occur after the date
hereof; provided that any facility fees accruing after the date on which the Commitments terminate shall be payable on demand. All facility fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual
number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). 
  39 


(b) Subject to Section 2.24, the Company agrees to pay (i) to the
Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a participation fee with respect to its participations in Letters of Credit, which shall accrue at the same Applicable Rate used to determine the interest rate applicable to Eurocurrency Revolving
Loans on the average daily Dollar Amount of such Lenders LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date
on which such Lenders Commitment terminates and the date on which such Lender ceases to have any LC Exposure and (ii) to the Issuing Bank for its own account a fronting fee, which shall accrue at the rate of 0.25% per annum on the
average daily Dollar Amount of the LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) attributable to Letters of Credit issued by the Issuing Bank during the period from and including the Effective Date to but
excluding the later of the date of termination of the Commitments and the date on which there ceases to be any LC Exposure, as well as the Issuing Banks standard fees and commissions with respect to the issuance, amendment, cancellation,
negotiation, transfer, presentment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or processing of drawings thereunder. Participation fees and fronting fees accrued through and including the last day of March, June, September and December of each
year shall be payable on the third (3rd) Business Day following such last day, commencing on the first such date to occur after the Effective Date; provided that all such fees shall be
payable on the date on which the Commitments terminate and any such fees accruing after the date on which the Commitments terminate shall be payable on demand. Any other fees payable to the Issuing Bank pursuant to this paragraph shall be payable
within ten (10) days after demand. All participation fees and fronting fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last
day). Participation fees and fronting fees in respect of Letters of Credit denominated in Dollars shall be paid in Dollars, and participation fees and fronting fees in respect of Letters of Credit denominated in a Foreign Currency shall be paid in
such Foreign Currency.  (c) The Company agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own account, fees payable in the
amounts and at the times separately agreed upon between the Company and the Administrative Agent.  (d) All fees payable
hereunder shall be paid on the dates due, in Dollars (except as otherwise expressly provided in this Section 2.12) and immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent (or to the Issuing Bank, in the case of fees payable to it) for
distribution, in the case of facility fees and participation fees, to the Lenders. Fees paid shall not be refundable under any circumstances. 
SECTION 2.13. Interest. (a) The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing (including each Swingline Loan) shall bear interest at
the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate (the ABR Spread).  (b) The Loans comprising each
Eurocurrency Borrowing shall bear interest at the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing plus the Applicable Rate (the Eurocurrency Spread). 
(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by any
Borrower hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of
any Loan, 2% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in the preceding paragraphs of this Section or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2% plus the rate applicable to ABR Loans as provided in paragraph (a) of this
Section. 
  40 


(d) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each Interest
Payment Date for such Loan and upon termination of the Commitments; provided that (i) interest accrued pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of
any Loan (other than a prepayment of an ABR Revolving Loan prior to the end of the Availability Period), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the
event of any conversion of any Eurocurrency Revolving Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion. 
(e) All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, except that interest (i) computed by
reference to the Alternate Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year) and (ii) for Borrowings denominated in Pounds
Sterling shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days, and in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). The applicable Alternate Base Rate, Adjusted LIBO Rate
or LIBO Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
SECTION 2.14. Alternate Rate of Interest. 
(a) If at the time that the Administrative Agent shall seek to determine the LIBOR Screen Rate on the Quotation Day for any
Interest Period for a Eurocurrency Borrowing the LIBOR Screen Rate shall not be available for such Interest Period and/or for the applicable currency with respect to such Eurocurrency Borrowing for any reason, and the Administrative Agent shall
reasonably determine that it is not possible to determine the Interpolated Rate (which conclusion shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error), then the Reference Bank Rate shall be the LIBO Rate for such Interest Period for such
Eurocurrency Borrowing; provided that if the Reference Bank Rate shall be less than zero, such rate shall be deemed to be zero for purposes of this Agreement; provided, further, however, that if less than two Reference Banks
shall supply a rate to the Administrative Agent for purposes of determining the LIBO Rate for such Eurocurrency Borrowing, (i) if such Borrowing shall be requested in Dollars, then such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing at the
Alternate Base Rate and (ii) if such Borrowing shall be requested in any Foreign Currency, the LIBO Rate shall be equal to the cost to each Lender to fund its pro rata share of such Eurocurrency Borrowing (from whatever source and using
whatever methodologies as such Lender may select in its reasonable discretion, such rate, the COF Rate). 
(b) If prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurocurrency Borrowing: 
(i) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that
adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate, as applicable, for a Loan in the applicable currency or for the applicable Interest Period; or 
(ii) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate, as applicable,
for a Loan in the applicable currency or for the applicable Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period; 
  41 


then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the applicable Borrower and the Lenders by telephone
or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the applicable Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that
requests the conversion of any Revolving Borrowing to, or continuation of any Revolving Borrowing as, a Eurocurrency Borrowing in the applicable currency or for the applicable Interest Period, as the case may be, shall be ineffective, (ii) if
any Borrowing Request requests a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing in Dollars, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing and (iii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurocurrency Borrowing in a Foreign Currency, then the LIBO Rate for
such Eurocurrency Borrowing shall be the COF Rate; provided that if the circumstances giving rise to such notice affect only one Type of Borrowings, then the other Type of Borrowings shall be permitted. 
SECTION 2.15. Increased Costs. (a) If any Change in Law shall: 
(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, liquidity or similar requirement (including any compulsory
loan requirement, insurance charge or other assessment) against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate) or the Issuing Bank; 
(ii) impose on any Lender or the Issuing Bank or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense (other than
Taxes) affecting this Agreement or Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein; or  (iii)
subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (e) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters
of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto;  and the result of any of the
foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender or such other Recipient of making, continuing, converting into or maintaining any Loan or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan or to increase the cost to such Lender, the Issuing
Bank or such other Recipient of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender, the Issuing Bank or such other Recipient hereunder, whether of principal,
interest or otherwise, then the applicable Borrower will pay to such Lender, the Issuing Bank or such other Recipient, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender, the Issuing Bank or such other Recipient, as
the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.  (b) If any Lender or the Issuing Bank
determines that any Change in Law regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lenders or the Issuing Banks capital or on the capital of such Lenders or the Issuing
Banks holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender
or the Issuing Bank or such Lenders or the Issuing Banks holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lenders or the Issuing Banks policies and the policies of such
Lenders 
  42 



or the Issuing Banks holding company with respect to capital adequacy and liquidity), then from time to time the applicable Borrower will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case
may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lenders or the Issuing Banks holding company for any such reduction suffered. 
(c) A certificate of a Lender or the Issuing Bank setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or
the Issuing Bank or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall be delivered to the Company and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Company shall pay, or cause the other
Borrowers to pay, such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within ten (10) days after receipt thereof. 
(d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not
constitute a waiver of such Lenders or the Issuing Banks right to demand such compensation; provided that the Company shall not be required to compensate a Lender or the Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section for any increased
costs or reductions incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, notifies the Company of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lenders or
the Issuing Banks intention to claim compensation therefor; provided further that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended
to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.  SECTION 2.16. Break Funding Payments. In the event of (a) the
payment of any principal of any Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default or as a result of any prepayment pursuant to Section 2.11), (b) the
conversion of any Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Eurocurrency Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto
(regardless of whether such notice may be revoked under Section 2.11(a) and is revoked in accordance therewith) or (d) the assignment of any Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result
of a request by the Company pursuant to Section 2.19, then, in any such event, the Borrowers shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such event (excluding any loss of anticipated profits or margin). Such
loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not
occurred, at the LIBO Rate that would have been applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the
period that would have been the Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest which would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of
such period, for deposits in the relevant currency of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the eurocurrency market. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to
this Section shall be delivered to the applicable Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The applicable Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within ten (10) days after receipt thereof.
 SECTION 2.17. Taxes. (a) Payments Free of Taxes. Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any
Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable law. If any applicable law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable Withholding Agent) requires the
deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a Withholding Agent, then the applicable Withholding Agent shall be 
  43 



entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law and, if such Tax
is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable
under this Section 2.17) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding for Indemnified Taxes been made. 
(b) Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrowers. The relevant Borrower shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in
accordance with applicable law, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for, Other Taxes.  (c) Evidence of
Payments. As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by any Loan Party or the Administrative Agent to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section 2.17, such Loan Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent, or the
Administrative Agent shall deliver to the relevant Borrower, as the case may be, the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other
evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent or the relevant Borrower, as the case may be.  (d)
Indemnification by the Loan Parties. The relevant Borrower shall indemnify each Recipient, within 10 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or
attributable to amounts payable under this Section) payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such
Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the relevant Borrower by a Lender (with a
copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
(e) Indemnification by the Lenders. Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand
therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Loan
Parties to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lenders failure to comply with the provisions of Section 9.04(c) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such
Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or
asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the
Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative
Agent under this paragraph (e).  (f) Status of Lenders. (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of
withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and
executed documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if

  44 



reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the
Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding
two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 2.17(f)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lenders reasonable judgment such
completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. 
(ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that any Borrower is a U.S. Person: 
(A) any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to such Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on
which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of such Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S.
Federal backup withholding tax;  (B) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to
such Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the
reasonable request of such Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:  (1) in the case of a Foreign
Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN establishing an exemption from, or reduction of,
U.S. Federal withholding Tax pursuant to the interest article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S.
Federal withholding Tax pursuant to the business profits or other income article of such tax treaty;  (2) executed
originals of IRS Form W-8ECI;  (3) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under
Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit G-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a bank within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a 10 percent
shareholder of such Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a controlled foreign corporation described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate)
and (y) executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN; or  (4) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed originals
of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit G-2 or Exhibit G-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial
owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a 
  45 



partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate
substantially in the form of Exhibit G-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner;  (C) any Foreign
Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to such Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a
Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of such Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a
reduction in U.S. Federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit such Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required
to be made; and  (D) if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. Federal withholding Tax
imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to such Borrower and the
Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by such Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by
Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by such Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for such Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under
FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lenders obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (D), FATCA shall include any
amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.  Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered
expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Company and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so. 
(g) Treatment of Certain Refunds. If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a
refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 2.17 (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.17), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund
(but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section 2.17 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any
interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph
(g) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the

hat such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this paragraph (g), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph (g) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net
after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with
respect to such Tax had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party
or any other Person. 
  46 


(h) Survival. Each partys obligations under this Section 2.17 shall survive the
resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document. 
(i) Defined Terms. For purposes of this Section 2.17, the term Lender includes the Issuing Bank. 
SECTION 2.18. Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs. 
(a) Each Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or
reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 2.15, 2.16 or 2.17, or otherwise) prior to (i) in the case of payments denominated in Dollars, 12:00 noon, New York City time and (ii) in the case of payments
denominated in a Foreign Currency, 12:00 noon, Local Time, in the city of the Administrative Agents Eurocurrency Payment Office for such currency, in each case on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or
counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments
shall be made (i) in the same currency in which the applicable Credit Event was made (or where such currency has been converted to Euro, in Euro) and (ii) to the Administrative Agent at its offices at 10 South Dearborn Street, Chicago,
Illinois 60603 or, in the case of a Credit Event denominated in a Foreign Currency, the Administrative Agents Eurocurrency Payment Office for such currency, except payments to be made directly to the Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender as
expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments denominated in the same
currency received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the
next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section, if, after the making of any Credit Event
in any Foreign Currency, currency control or exchange regulations are imposed in the country which issues such currency with the result that the type of currency in which the Credit Event was made (the Original Currency) no longer
exists or any Borrower is not able to make payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders in such Original Currency, then all payments to be made by such Borrower hereunder in such currency shall instead be made when due in
Dollars in an amount equal to the Dollar Amount (as of the date of repayment) of such payment due, it being the intention of the parties hereto that the Borrowers take all risks of the imposition of any such currency control or exchange regulations.
 (b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts
of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the
amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal
and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties. 
  47 


(c) [Intentionally Omitted]. 
(d) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any
principal of or interest on any of its Revolving Loans or participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans and participations in
LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Revolving Loans and
participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued
interest on their respective Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans; provided that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered,
such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by any Borrower pursuant to
and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans to any
assignee or participant, other than to the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). Each Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under
applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct
creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation.  (e) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received
notice from the relevant Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may
assume that such Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if such Borrower has not
in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon,
for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in
accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation (including without limitation the Overnight Foreign Currency Rate in the case of Loans denominated in a Foreign Currency). 
(f) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.05(c), 2.06(d) or (e),
2.07(b), 2.18(e) or 9.03(c), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), (i) apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender and for the
benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lender or the Issuing Bank to satisfy such Lenders obligations to it under such Section until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid and/or (ii) hold any such amounts in a
segregated account over which the Administrative Agent shall 
  48 



have exclusive control as cash collateral for, and application to, any future funding obligations of such Lender under any such Section; in the case of each of clauses (i) and
(ii) above, in any order as determined by the Administrative Agent in its discretion.  SECTION 2.19. Mitigation Obligations;
Replacement of Lenders. (a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if any Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any
Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices,
branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.17, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject
such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Company hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or
assignment.  (b) If (i) any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, (ii) any Borrower is required
to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17 or (iii) any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the Company may, at its sole
expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights
(other than its existing rights to payments pursuant to Sections 2.15 or 2.17) and obligations under the Loan Documents to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment);
provided that (i) the Company shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (and if a Commitment is being assigned, the Issuing Bank and the Swingline Lender), which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld,
(ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and funded participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to
it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Company (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation
under Section 2.15 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.17, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, within
five (5) Business Days after being notified that the Company proposes to require a Lender to make such assignment and delegation hereunder, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Company to require
such assignment and delegation cease to apply.  SECTION 2.20. Expansion Option. The Company may from time to time elect to
increase the Commitments or enter into one or more tranches of term loans (each an Incremental Term Loan), in each case in minimum increments of $25,000,000 so long as, after giving effect thereto, the aggregate amount of such
increases in Commitments and all such Incremental Term Loans does not exceed $150,000,000. The Company may arrange for any such increase or tranche to be provided by one or more Lenders (each Lender so agreeing to an increase in its Commitment, or
to participate in such Incremental Term Loans, an Increasing Lender), or by one or more new banks, financial institutions or other entities constituting Eligible Assignees (each such new bank, financial institution or other
entity, an Augmenting Lender), which agree to increase their existing Commitments, or to participate in such Incremental Term Loans, or provide new Commitments, as the case may be; provided that (i) each Augmenting
Lender, shall be subject to the approval of the Company and the Administrative Agent, such 
  49 



approvals not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed and (ii) (x) in the case of an Increasing Lender, the Company and such Increasing Lender execute an agreement substantially in the
form of Exhibit C hereto, and (y) in the case of an Augmenting Lender, the Company and such Augmenting Lender execute an agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit D hereto. No consent of any Lender (other than the
Lenders participating in the increase or any Incremental Term Loan) shall be required for any increase in Commitments or Incremental Term Loan pursuant to this Section 2.20. Increases and new Commitments and Incremental Term Loans created
pursuant to this Section 2.20 shall become effective on the date agreed by the Company, the Administrative Agent and the relevant Increasing Lenders or Augmenting Lenders, and the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender thereof.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no increase in the Commitments (or in the Commitment of any Lender) or tranche of Incremental Term Loans shall become effective under this paragraph unless, (i) on the proposed date of the effectiveness of such
increase or Incremental Term Loans, (A) the conditions set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of Section 4.02 shall be satisfied or waived by the Required Lenders and the Administrative Agent shall have received a certificate to
that effect dated such date and executed by a Financial Officer of the Company and (B) the Company shall be in pro forma compliance with the covenants contained in Section 6.11 (determined on the basis of the financial information most
recently delivered to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders pursuant to Section 5.01(a) or Section 5.01(b) (or, if prior to the date of the delivery of the first financial statements to be delivered pursuant to such Sections, the most
recent financial statements referred to in Section 3.05(b))) and if the proviso in Section 6.11 is then applicable, as though such Indebtedness had been incurred, and any Indebtedness repaid as part of such transaction had been repaid, as
of the first day of the period of four fiscal quarters covered thereby) and (ii) the Administrative Agent shall have received documents and opinions consistent with those delivered on the Effective Date as to the organizational power and
authority of the Borrowers to borrow hereunder after giving effect to such increase. On the effective date of any increase in the Commitments or any Incremental Term Loans being made, (i) each relevant Increasing Lender and Augmenting Lender
shall make available to the Administrative Agent such amounts in immediately available funds as the Administrative Agent shall determine, for the benefit of the other Lenders, as being required in order to cause, after giving effect to such increase
and the use of such amounts to make payments to such other Lenders, each Lenders portion of the outstanding Revolving Loans of all the Lenders to equal its Applicable Percentage of such outstanding Revolving Loans, and (ii) except in the
case of any Incremental Term Loans, the Borrowers shall be deemed to have repaid and reborrowed all outstanding Revolving Loans as of the date of any increase in the Commitments (with such reborrowing to consist of the Types of Revolving Loans, with
related Interest Periods if applicable, specified in a notice delivered by the applicable Borrower, or the Company on behalf of the applicable Borrower, in accordance with the requirements of Section 2.03). The deemed payments made pursuant to
clause (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence shall be accompanied by payment of all accrued interest on the amount prepaid and, in respect of each Eurocurrency Loan, shall be subject to indemnification by the Borrowers pursuant to the
provisions of Section 2.16 if the deemed payment occurs other than on the last day of the related Interest Periods. The Incremental Term Loans (a) shall rank pari passu in right of payment with the Revolving Loans, (b) shall not
mature earlier than the Maturity Date (but may have amortization prior to such date) and (c) shall be treated substantially the same as (and in any event no more favorably than) the Revolving Loans; provided that (i) the terms and
conditions applicable to any tranche of Incremental Term Loans maturing after the Maturity Date may provide for material additional or different financial or other covenants or prepayment requirements applicable only during periods after the
Maturity Date and (ii) the Incremental Term Loans may be priced differently than the Revolving Loans. Incremental Term Loans may be made hereunder pursuant to an amendment or restatement (an Incremental Term Loan Amendment)
of this Agreement and, as appropriate, the other Loan Documents, executed by the Borrowers, each Increasing Lender participating in such tranche, each Augmenting Lender participating in such tranche, if any, and the Administrative Agent. The
Incremental Term Loan Amendment may, without the consent of any other Lenders, effect such amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent, to

  50 



effect the provisions of this Section 2.20. Nothing contained in this Section 2.20 shall constitute, or otherwise be deemed to be, a commitment on the part of any Lender to increase its
Commitment hereunder, or provide Incremental Term Loans, at any time.  SECTION 2.21. Extension of Maturity Date. 
(a) Requests for Extension. The Company may, by notice to the Administrative Agent (who shall promptly notify the
Lenders) not earlier than 45 days and not later than 35 days prior to each anniversary of the date of this Agreement (each such date, an Extension Date), request that each Lender extend such Lenders Maturity Date to the date
that is one year after the Maturity Date then in effect for such Lender (the Existing Maturity Date). 
(b) Lender Elections to Extend. Each Lender, acting in its sole and individual discretion, shall, by notice to the
Administrative Agent given not later than the date that is 20 days after the date on which the Administrative Agent received the Companys extension request (the Lender Notice Date), advise the Administrative Agent whether or
not such Lender agrees to such extension (each Lender that determines to so extend its Maturity Date, an Extending Lender). Each Lender that determines not to so extend its Maturity Date (a Non-Extending Lender)
shall notify the Administrative Agent of such fact promptly after such determination (but in any event no later than the Lender Notice Date), and any Lender that does not so advise the Administrative Agent on or before the Lender Notice Date shall
be deemed to be a Non-Extending Lender. The election of any Lender to agree to such extension shall not obligate any other Lender to so agree, and it is understood and agreed that no Lender shall have any obligation whatsoever to agree to any
request made by the Company for extension of the Maturity Date.  (c) Notification by Administrative Agent. The
Administrative Agent shall notify the Company of each Lenders determination under this Section no later than the date that is 15 days prior to the applicable Extension Date (or, if such date is not a Business Day, on the next preceding
Business Day).  (d) Additional Commitment Lenders. The Company shall have the right, but shall not be obligated at
any time, on or before the applicable Maturity Date for any Non-Extending Lender to replace such Non-Extending Lender with, and add as Lenders under this Agreement in place thereof, one or more Eligible Assignees (each, an
Additional Commitment Lender) approved by the Administrative Agent in accordance with the procedures provided in Section 2.19(b), each of which Additional Commitment Lenders shall have entered into an Assignment and
Assumption (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04, with the Company or replacement Lender obligated to pay any applicable processing or recordation fee) with such Non-Extending Lender, pursuant to which
such Additional Commitment Lenders shall, effective on or before the applicable Maturity Date for such Non-Extending Lender, assume a Commitment (and, if any such Additional Commitment Lender is already a Lender, its Commitment shall be in addition
to such Lenders Commitment hereunder on such date). Prior to any Non-Extending Lender being replaced by one or more Additional Commitment Lenders pursuant hereto, such Non-Extending Lender may elect, in its sole discretion, by giving
irrevocable notice thereof to the Administrative Agent and the Company (which notice shall set forth such Lenders new Maturity Date), to become an Extending Lender. The Administrative Agent may effect such amendments to this Agreement as are
reasonably necessary to provide for any such extensions with the consent of the Company but without the consent of any other Lenders. 
  51 


(e) Minimum Extension Requirement. If (and only if) the total of the
Commitments of the Lenders that have agreed to extend their Maturity Date and the new or increased Commitments of any Additional Commitment Lenders is more than 50% of the aggregate amount of the Commitments in effect immediately prior to the
applicable Extension Date, then, effective as of the applicable Extension Date, the Maturity Date of each Extending Lender and of each Additional Commitment Lender shall be extended to the date that is one year after the Existing Maturity Date
(except that, if such date is not a Business Day, such Maturity Date as so extended shall be the next preceding Business Day) and each Additional Commitment Lender shall thereupon become a Lender for all purposes of this Agreement and
shall be bound by the provisions of this Agreement as a Lender hereunder and shall have the obligations of a Lender hereunder. 
(f) Conditions to Effectiveness of Extension. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) no more than two
(2) extensions of the Maturity Date shall be permitted hereunder and (y) any extension of any Maturity Date pursuant to this Section 2.21 shall not be effective with respect to any Extending Lender unless: 
(i) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing on the applicable Extension Date and immediately after
giving effect thereto;  (ii) the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement are true and
correct in all material respects (or, in the case of any representation or warranty qualified by materiality or Material Adverse Effect, in all respects) on and as of the applicable Extension Date and after giving effect thereto, as though made on
and as of such date (or, if any such representation or warranty is expressly stated to have been made as of a specific date, as of such specific date); and 
(iii) the Administrative Agent shall have received a certificate from the Company signed by a Financial Officer of the Company
(A) certifying the accuracy of the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) and (B) certifying and attaching the resolutions adopted by each Borrower approving or consenting to such extension. 
(g) Maturity Date for Non-Extending Lenders. On the Maturity Date of each Non-Extending Lender, (i) the Commitment
of each Non-Extending Lender shall automatically terminate and (ii) the Company shall repay such Non-Extending Lender in accordance with Section 2.10 (and shall pay to such Non-Extending Lender all of the other Obligations owing to it
under this Agreement) and after giving effect thereto shall prepay any Revolving Loans outstanding on such date (and pay any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 2.16) to the extent necessary to keep outstanding Revolving Loans
ratable with any revised Applicable Percentages of the respective Lenders effective as of such date, and the Administrative Agent shall administer any necessary reallocation of the Revolving Credit Exposures (without regard to any minimum borrowing,
pro rata borrowing and/or pro rata payment requirements contained elsewhere in this Agreement).  (h) Conflicting
Provisions. This Section shall supersede any provisions in Section 2.18 or Section 9.02 to the contrary.  SECTION 2.22.
Judgment Currency. If for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due from any Borrower hereunder in the currency expressed to be payable herein (the specified currency) into another
currency, the parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent that they may effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance 
  52 



with normal banking procedures the Administrative Agent could purchase the specified currency with such other currency at the Administrative Agents main New York City office on the Business
Day preceding that on which final, non-appealable judgment is given. The obligations of each Borrower in respect of any sum due to any Lender or the Administrative Agent hereunder shall, notwithstanding any
judgment in a currency other than the specified currency, be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) of any sum adjudged to be so due in such other
currency such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) may in accordance with normal, reasonable banking procedures purchase the specified currency with such other currency. If the amount of the specified currency so purchased is less
than the sum originally due to such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, in the specified currency, each Borrower agrees, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such
judgment, to indemnify such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, against such loss, and if the amount of the specified currency so purchased exceeds (a) the sum originally due to any Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the
case may be, in the specified currency and (b) any amounts shared with other Lenders as a result of allocations of such excess as a disproportionate payment to such Lender under Section 2.18, such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the
case may be, agrees to remit such excess to such Borrower.  SECTION 2.23. Designation of Subsidiary Borrowers. On the
Effective Date, and subject to the satisfaction of the applicable conditions in Article IV hereto, each of the Initial Finnish Borrower and Health Sciences shall become Subsidiary Borrowers party to this Agreement until the Company shall have
executed and delivered to the Administrative Agent a Borrowing Subsidiary Termination with respect to any such Subsidiary, whereupon such Subsidiary shall cease to be a Subsidiary Borrower and a party to this Agreement. After the Effective Date, the
Company may at any time and from time to time designate any Eligible Subsidiary as a Subsidiary Borrower by delivery to the Administrative Agent of a Borrowing Subsidiary Agreement executed by such Subsidiary and the Company and the satisfaction of
the other conditions precedent set forth in Section 4.03, and upon such delivery and satisfaction such Subsidiary shall for all purposes of this Agreement be a Subsidiary Borrower and a party to this Agreement. Each Subsidiary Borrower shall
remain a Subsidiary Borrower until the Company shall have executed and delivered to the Administrative Agent a Borrowing Subsidiary Termination with respect to such Subsidiary, whereupon such Subsidiary shall cease to be a Subsidiary Borrower and a
party to this Agreement. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, no Borrowing Subsidiary Termination will become effective as to any Subsidiary Borrower at a time when any principal of or interest on any Loan to such Borrower shall be outstanding
hereunder, provided that such Borrowing Subsidiary Termination shall be effective to terminate the right of such Subsidiary Borrower to make further Borrowings under this Agreement. As soon as practicable upon receipt of a Borrowing
Subsidiary Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall furnish a copy thereof to each Lender. It is understood and agreed that the obligations of each Subsidiary Borrower shall be several in nature. Each Subsidiary of the Company that is or becomes a
Subsidiary Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.23 hereby irrevocably appoints the Company as its agent for all purposes relevant to this Agreement and each of the other Loan Documents, including (i) the giving and receipt of notices,
(ii) the execution and delivery of all documents, instruments and certificates contemplated herein and all modifications hereto, and (iii) the receipt of the proceeds of any Loans made by the Lenders to any such Subsidiary Borrower
hereunder. Any acknowledgment, consent, direction, certification or other action which might otherwise be valid or effective only if given or taken by all Borrowers, or by each Borrower acting singly, shall be valid and effective if given or taken
only by the Company, whether or not any such other Borrower joins therein. Any notice, demand, consent, acknowledgement, direction, certification or other communication delivered to the Company in accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall be
deemed to have been delivered to each Subsidiary Borrower. 
  53 


SECTION 2.24. Defaulting Lenders. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender: 
(a) fees shall cease to accrue on the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.12(a); 
(b) the Commitment and Revolving Credit Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether the
Required Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment, waiver or other modification pursuant to Section 9.02); provided, that, except as otherwise provided in Section 9.02, this
clause (b) shall not apply to the vote of a Defaulting Lender in the case of an amendment, waiver or other modification requiring the consent of such Lender or each Lender directly affected thereby; 
(c) if any Swingline Exposure or LC Exposure exists at the time such Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender then: 
(i) all or any part of the Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall be reallocated among the
non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages but only to the extent that the sum of all non-Defaulting Lenders Revolving Credit Exposures plus such Defaulting Lenders Swingline Exposure and LC
Exposure does not exceed the total of all non-Defaulting Lenders Commitments;  (ii) if the reallocation described in
clause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Company shall within one (1) Business Day following notice by the Administrative Agent (x) first, prepay such Swingline Exposure and (y) second, cash
collateralize for the benefit of the Issuing Bank only the Borrowers obligations corresponding to such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (i) above) in accordance with
the procedures set forth in Section 2.06(j) for so long as such LC Exposure is outstanding;  (iii) the Borrowers shall
not be required to pay any fees to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.12(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure except during the period such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure is cash collateralized by such
Defaulting Lender;  (iv) if the LC Exposure of the non-Defaulting Lenders is reallocated pursuant to clause (i) above,
then the fees payable to the Lenders pursuant to Section 2.12(b) shall be adjusted in accordance with such non-Defaulting Lenders Applicable Percentages; and 
(v) if all or any portion of such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure is neither reallocated nor cash collateralized pursuant
to clause (i) or (ii) above, then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of the Issuing Bank or any other Lender hereunder, all facility fees that otherwise would have been payable to such Defaulting Lender (solely with respect to
the portion of such Defaulting Lenders Commitment that was utilized by such LC Exposure) and letter of credit fees payable under Section 2.12(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure shall be payable to the Issuing
Bank until and to the extent that such LC Exposure is reallocated and/or cash collateralized; and 
  54 


(d) so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender, the Swingline Lender shall not
be required to fund any Swingline Loan and the Issuing Bank shall not be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless it is satisfied that the related exposure and the Defaulting Lenders then outstanding LC Exposure will
be 100% covered by the Commitments of the non-Defaulting Lenders and/or cash collateral will be provided by the Company in accordance with Section 2.24(c), and participating interests in any such newly made Swingline Loan or any newly issued or
increased Letter of Credit shall be allocated among non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent with Section 2.24(c)(i) (and such Defaulting Lender shall not participate therein). 
No reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from
that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such non-Defaulting Lenders increased exposure following such reallocation. 
In the event that the Administrative Agent, the Company, the Swingline Lender and the Issuing Bank each agrees that a Defaulting Lender has
adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then the Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure of the Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lenders Commitment and on such date such Lender
shall purchase at par such of the Loans of the other Lenders (other than Swingline Loans) as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Loans in accordance with its Applicable Percentage,
whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of a Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and
provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from
that Lenders having been a Defaulting Lender.  ARTICLE III 
Representations and Warranties

execution or otherwise) under the laws of the jurisdiction in which such Foreign Subsidiary Borrower is organized and existing in respect of its obligations under the Applicable Foreign Subsidiary Borrower Documents. 
  60 


(b) The Applicable Foreign Subsidiary Borrower Documents are in proper legal form
under the Laws of the jurisdiction in which such Foreign Subsidiary Borrower is organized and existing for the enforcement thereof against such Foreign Subsidiary Borrower under the Laws of such jurisdiction, and to ensure the legality, validity,

recording, execution or notarization as has been made or is not required to be made until the Applicable Foreign Subsidiary Borrower Document or any other document is sought to be enforced and (ii) any charge or tax as has been timely paid.
 (c) There is no tax, levy, impost, duty, fee, assessment or other governmental charge, or any deduction or withholding,

Subsidiary Borrower are, under applicable foreign exchange control regulations of the jurisdiction in which such Foreign Subsidiary Borrower is organized and existing, not subject to any notification or authorization except (i) such as have

SECTION 3.19. Anti-Corruption Laws and Sanctions. The Company has implemented and maintains in effect policies and procedures
which it reasonably believes are adequate to ensure compliance in all material respects by the Company, its Subsidiaries and, to the Companys knowledge, their respective directors, officers and employees with Anti-Corruption Laws and
applicable Sanctions. The Company, its Subsidiaries and, to the knowledge of the Company, their respective officers, employees and directors, are in compliance with Anti-Corruption Laws and applicable Sanctions, except in such instances in which the
failure to comply therewith, either individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. None of (a) the Company, any Subsidiary or to the knowledge of the Company or such Subsidiary any of their
respective directors, officers or employees, or (b) to the knowledge of the Company, any agent of the Company or any Subsidiary that will act in any capacity in connection with or benefit from the credit facility established hereby, is a

(i.e., the Section with regard to Credit Event Upon Merger; it being understood that if in a subsequent form such Credit Event Upon Merger provision is located in a different Section, then this clause (B) shall
refer to such new Section) (or any analogous event howsoever described) of such Swap Contract or any Additional Termination Event (as defined in such Swap Contract), in each case with respect to this clause (B) (x) in respect of which the
Company or any Subsidiary is the sole Affected Party (as defined in such Swap Contract) unless the relevant Additional Termination Event is (I) an optional early termination right exercised by the other party to the Swap Contract, where such

Facility resulting solely from a decline in the ratings of the Company or its Subsidiaries shall not constitute an Event of Default; or 
(f) Insolvency Proceedings, Etc. The Company or any of its Material Subsidiaries institutes or consents to the
institution of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law, or makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors; or applies for or consents to the appointment of any

SECTION 7.02. Remedies Upon Event of Default If any Event of Default occurs and is
continuing then, and in every such event (other than an event with respect to any Borrower described in Section 7.01(f), and at any time thereafter during the continuance of such event, the Administrative Agent may, and at the request of the
Required Lenders shall, by notice to the Company, take either or both of the following actions, at the same or different times: (i) terminate the Commitments, and thereupon the Commitments shall terminate immediately, and (ii) declare the
Loans then outstanding to be due and payable in whole (or in part, in which case any principal not so declared to be due and payable may thereafter be declared to be due and payable), and thereupon the principal of the Loans so declared to be due
and payable, together with accrued interest thereon and all fees and other Obligations of the Borrowers accrued hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, shall become due and payable immediately, without presentment, demand, protest or other
notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by the Borrowers; and in case of any event with respect to any Borrower described in Section 7.01(f) of this Article, the Commitments shall automatically terminate and the principal of the
Loans then outstanding, together with accrued interest thereon and all fees and other Obligations accrued hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, shall automatically become due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice
of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by the Borrowers. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Administrative Agent may, and at the request of the Required Lenders shall, exercise any rights and remedies
provided to the Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents or at law or equity.  ARTICLE VIII 
The Administrative Agent 
Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent as its agent and authorizes the Administrative
Agent to take such actions on its behalf, including execution of the other Loan Documents, and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms of the Loan Documents, together with such actions and powers as are
reasonably incidental thereto.  The bank serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its
capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and such bank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business with the Company
or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder.  The Administrative Agent shall not
have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth in the Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of
whether a Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated by the
Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise in writing as directed by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.02),
and (c) except as expressly set forth in the Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the
Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.02) or in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Administrative Agent shall
be deemed not to have knowledge of 
  80 



any Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to the Administrative Agent by the Company or a Lender, and the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to
ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with any Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or in connection with any Loan
Document, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth in any Loan Document, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of any Loan Document or any
other agreement, instrument or document or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere in any Loan Document, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the
Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any
notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or
by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Company), independent accountants and other
experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts. 
The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents
appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of the preceding
paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for
herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.  Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Administrative Agent as
provided in this paragraph, the Administrative Agent may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders, the Issuing Bank and the Company. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor, which successor
shall be consented to by the Company at all times other than during the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default (which consent of the Company shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). If no successor shall have been so appointed by
the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment, and/or the consent of the Company (if required pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence) has not been granted, within thirty (30) days after the retiring Administrative Agent
gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank, with the consent of the Company at all times other than during the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default (which
consent of the Company shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), appoint a successor Administrative Agent which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as
Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from
its duties and obligations hereunder. The fees payable by any Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between such Borrower and such successor. After the
Administrative Agents resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 9.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of
any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as Administrative Agent. 
  81 


Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that the extensions of credit made hereunder are commercial
loans and letters of credit and not investments in a business enterprise or securities. Each Lender further represents that it is engaged in making, acquiring or holding commercial loans in the ordinary course of its business and has, independently
and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement as a Lender, and to make, acquire
or hold Loans hereunder. Each Lender shall, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information (which may contain material, non-public information within the meaning of
the United States securities laws concerning the Company and its Affiliates) as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any related agreement
or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder and in deciding whether or to the extent to which it will continue as a lender or assign or otherwise transfer its rights, interests and obligations hereunder. 
None of the Lenders or their Affiliates, if any, identified in this Agreement as a Joint Bookrunner, Co-Syndication Agent or Co-Documentation
Agent shall have any right, power, obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this Agreement other than, in the case of Lenders, those applicable to all Lenders as such. Without limiting the foregoing, none of the Joint Bookrunners or such
Lenders shall have or be deemed to have a fiduciary relationship with any Lender. Each Lender hereby makes the same acknowledgments with respect to the relevant Lenders and their Affiliates in their respective capacities as Co-Syndication Agents,
Co-Documentation Agents or Joint Bookrunners, as applicable, as it makes with respect to the Administrative Agent in the preceding paragraph. 
The Lenders are not partners or co-venturers, and no Lender shall be liable for the acts or omissions of, or (except as otherwise set forth
herein in case of the Administrative Agent) authorized to act for, any other Lender. The Administrative Agent shall have the exclusive right on behalf of the Lenders to enforce the payment of the principal of and interest on any Loan after the date
such principal or interest has become due and payable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.  ARTICLE IX

The Administrative Agent or the Company may, in its discretion, agree to accept notices and other communications to it hereunder by electronic communications pursuant to procedures approved by it; provided that approval of such procedures may
be limited to particular notices or communications.  Unless the Administrative Agent otherwise prescribes, (i) notices and other

available to the Issuing Bank and the other Lenders by posting the Communications on Debt Domain, Intralinks, Syndtrak, ClearPar or a substantially similar Electronic System. 
  83 


(ii) Any Electronic System used by the Administrative Agent is provided as
is and as available. The Agent Parties (as defined below) do not warrant the adequacy of such Electronic Systems and expressly disclaim liability for errors or omissions in the Communications. No warranty of any kind, express,
implied or statutory, including, without limitation, any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement of third-party rights or freedom from viruses or other code defects, is made by any Agent Party in connection
with the Communications or any Electronic System. In no event shall the Administrative Agent or any of its Related Parties (collectively, the Agent Parties) have any liability to any Loan Party, any Lender, the Issuing Bank or any
other Person or entity for damages of any kind, including, without limitation, direct or indirect, special, incidental or consequential damages, losses or expenses (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) arising out of any Loan Partys or the
Administrative Agents transmission of Communications through an Electronic System, except to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by a final and nonappealable
judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Agent Party; provided, however, that in no event shall any Agent Party have any liability to any Borrower, any Lender, the Issuing Bank or any other
Person for indirect, special, incidental, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages. Communications means, collectively, any notice, demand, communication, information, document or other material
provided by or on behalf of any Loan Party pursuant to any Loan Document or the transactions contemplated therein which is distributed by the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Bank by means of electronic communications pursuant to this
Section, including through an Electronic System.  SECTION 9.02. Waivers; Amendments. (a) No failure or delay by the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any
abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the
Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by any Borrower therefrom
shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Bank may have had notice or knowledge of
such Default at the time.  (b) Except as provided in Section 2.20 with respect to an Incremental Term Loan Amendment
and Section 2.21 with respect to the extension of the then-existing Maturity Date, neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the
Borrowers (or the Company acting on behalf of the Borrowers) and the Required Lenders or by the Borrowers (or the Company acting on behalf of the Borrowers) and the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders; provided that
no such agreement shall (i) increase the Commitment of any Lender without the written consent of such Lender, (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement or reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce any fees
payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby (provided that only the consent of the Required Lenders shall be necessary to amend the provisions of Section 2.13(c) or to waive any obligation of
any Borrower to pay interest or any other amount at the 
  84 



interest rate prescribed in such Section), (iii) postpone the scheduled date of payment of the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement, or any interest thereon, or any fees payable
hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any Commitment, without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby, (iv) change Section 2.18(b) or
(d) in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby, without the written consent of each Lender, (v) change any of the provisions of this Section or the definition of Required Lenders or any
other provision hereof specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or modify any rights hereunder or make any determination or grant any consent hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender (it being understood
that, solely with the consent of the parties prescribed by Section 2.20 to be parties to an Incremental Term Loan Amendment, Incremental Term Loans may be included in the determination of Required Lenders on substantially the same basis as the
Commitments and the Revolving Loans are included on the Effective Date), or (vi) release the Company from the Company Guaranty without the written consent of each Lender; provided further that no such agreement shall amend, modify
or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, as the case may be (it
being understood that any change to Section 2.24 shall require the consent of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Swingline Lender). Notwithstanding the foregoing, no consent with respect to any amendment, waiver or other
modification of this Agreement shall be required of any Defaulting Lender, except with respect to any amendment, waiver or other modification referred to in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of the first proviso of this paragraph and then only in
the event such Defaulting Lender shall be directly affected by such amendment, waiver or other modification.  (c)
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement and any other Loan Document may be amended (or amended and restated) with the written consent of the Required Lenders, the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers (x) to add one or more credit
facilities (in addition to the Incremental Term Loans pursuant to an Incremental Term Loan Amendment) to this Agreement and to permit extensions of credit from time to time outstanding thereunder and the accrued interest and fees in respect thereof
to share ratably in the benefits of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents with the Revolving Loans, Incremental Term Loans and the accrued interest and fees in respect thereof and (y) to include appropriately the Lenders holding such
credit facilities in any determination of the Required Lenders and Lenders.  (d) If (i) in connection with any
proposed amendment, waiver or consent requiring the consent of each Lender or each Lender directly affected thereby, the consent of the Required Lenders is obtained, but the consent of other necessary Lenders is not obtained
or (ii) any Lender becomes a Non-Extending Lender (any such Lender whose consent is necessary but not obtained, and any such Lender that becomes a Non-Extending Lender, being referred to herein as a Non-Consenting Lender),
then the Company may elect to replace a Non-Consenting Lender as a Lender party to this Agreement, provided that, concurrently with such replacement, (i) another bank or other entity which is reasonably satisfactory to the Company and the
Administrative Agent shall agree, as of such date, to purchase for cash the Loans and other Obligations due to the Non-Consenting Lender pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption and to become a Lender for all purposes under this Agreement and to
assume all obligations of the Non-Consenting Lender to be terminated as of such date and to comply with the requirements of clause (b) of Section 9.04, and (ii) each Borrower shall pay to such Non-Consenting Lender in same day funds
on the day of such replacement (1) all interest, fees and other amounts then accrued but unpaid to such Non-Consenting Lender by such Borrower hereunder to and including the date of termination, including without limitation payments due to such
Non-Consenting 
  85 



Lender under Sections 2.15 and 2.17, and (2) an amount, if any, equal to the payment which would have been due to such Lender on the day of such replacement under Section 2.16 had
the Loans of such Non-Consenting Lender been prepaid on such date rather than sold to the replacement Lender.  (e)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein the Administrative Agent may, with the consent of the Borrowers only, amend, modify or supplement this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents to cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect or
inconsistency.  SECTION 9.03. Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver. (a) The Company shall pay (i) all reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent and its Affiliates, including the reasonable and documented fees, charges and disbursements of counsel for the Administrative Agent, in connection with the syndication and
distribution (including, without limitation, via the internet or through a service such as Intralinks) of the credit facilities provided for herein, the preparation and administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents or any amendments,
modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof or thereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be consummated), (ii) all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Issuing Bank in
connection with the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or any demand for payment thereunder and (iii) all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender, including the
fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or, after the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default, any Lender, in connection with the enforcement or protection of its rights in
connection with this Agreement and any other Loan Document, including its rights under this Section, or in connection with the Loans made or Letters of Credit issued hereunder, including all such out-of-pocket expenses incurred during any workout,
restructuring or negotiations in respect of such Loans or Letters of Credit.  (b) The Company shall indemnify the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank, each Joint Bookrunner and each Lender (including each Co-Syndication Agent and each Co-Documentation Agent), and each Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an
Indemnitee) against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses, including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee, incurred by or
asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of any Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated thereby, the performance by the parties hereto of their
respective obligations thereunder or the consummation of the Transactions or any other transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds therefrom (including any refusal by the Issuing Bank to honor
a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit if the documents presented in connection with such demand do not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit), (iii) any actual or alleged 

ny of its Subsidiaries, or any Environmental Liability related in any way to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iv) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or
proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory, whether brought by a third party or by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto;
provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable
judgment to have resulted from (x) the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee, (y) a claim initiated by the Company against such Indemnitee for a breach in bad faith by such Indemnitee of its obligations under this
Agreement or (z) any disputes solely among Indemnitees (other than (A)
  86 



claims against any of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders or any of their Affiliates in its capacity or in fulfilling its role as the Administrative Agent, Issuing Bank, Swingline Lender, a
lead arranger, a bookrunner or any similar role under this Agreement and (B) claims arising as a result of an act or omission by the Company or any of its Affiliates). This Section 9.03(b) shall not apply with respect to Taxes other than
any Taxes that represent losses, claims or damages arising from any non-Tax claim.  (c) To the extent that the Company
fails to pay any amount required to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, the
Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, as the case may be, such Lenders Applicable Percentage (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount (it being understood that
the Companys failure to pay any such amount shall not relieve the Company of any default in the payment thereof); provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may
be, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender in its capacity as such. 
(d) To the extent permitted by applicable law, no Borrower shall assert, and each Borrower hereby waives, any claim against any
Indemnitee (i) for any damages arising from the use by others of information or other materials obtained through telecommunications, electronic or other information transmission systems (including the Internet) other than, in each case, for
direct or actual damages resulting from such Indemnitees (x) gross negligence, (y) willful misconduct or (z) breach in bad faith of its obligations under this Agreement pursuant to a claim initiated by the Company, in each case
as determined by a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, or (ii) on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in
connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby, the Transactions, any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof. 
(e) All amounts due under this Section shall be payable not later than fifteen (15) days after written demand
therefor.  SECTION 9.04. Successors and Assigns. (a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of the Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit), except that (i) no Borrower may assign or otherwise transfer any of
its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any attempted assignment or transfer by any Borrower without such consent shall be null and void) and (ii) no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer its
rights or obligations hereunder except in accordance with this Section. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted
hereby (including any Affiliate of the Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit), Participants (to the extent provided in paragraph (c) of this Section) and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement. 
(b) (i) Subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(ii) below, any Lender may assign to one or more Eligible
Assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it). 
  87 


(ii) Assignments shall be subject to the following additional conditions: 
(A) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund or an assignment of the
entire remaining amount of the assigning Lenders Commitment or Loans of any Class, the amount of the Commitment or Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with
respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $5,000,000 unless each of the Company and the Administrative Agent otherwise consent, provided that no such consent of the Company shall be required
if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing;  (B) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a
proportionate part of all the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement;  (C) the parties to
each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500, such fee to be paid by either the assigning Lender or the assignee Lender or shared between
such Lenders; and  (D) the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an
Administrative Questionnaire in which the assignee designates one or more credit contacts to whom all syndicate-level information (which may contain material non-public information about the Company and its affiliates and their Related Parties or
their respective securities) will be made available and who may receive such information in accordance with the assignees compliance procedures and applicable laws, including Federal and state securities laws. 
(iii) Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to paragraph (b)(iv) of this Section, from and after the
effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this
Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of
the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03). Any assignment or transfer by a
Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 9.04 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with
paragraph (c) of this Section.  (iv) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of each Borrower,
shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of, and principal amount (and stated interest) of the
Loans and LC Disbursements owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the Register). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the
Lenders shall treat each Person 
  88 



whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be
available for inspection by the Company, the Issuing Bank and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. 
(v) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the
assignees completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section and any written consent to such assignment
required by paragraph (b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information contained therein in the Register; provided that if either the assigning Lender or the assignee
shall have failed to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.05(c), 2.06(d) or (e), 2.07(b), 2.18(e) or 9.03(c), the Administrative Agent shall have no obligation to accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the
information therein in the Register unless and until such payment shall have been made in full, together with all accrued interest thereon. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register
as provided in this paragraph.  (c) Any Lender may, without the consent of any Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the
Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (a Participant), other than a natural person, a Defaulting Lender or the Company or any of the Companys Affiliates or
Subsidiaries, in all or a portion of such Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing to it); provided that (A) such Lenders obligations under this
Agreement shall remain unchanged; (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations; and (C) the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the other Lenders
shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such
Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the
consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Section 9.02(b) that affects such Participant. Each Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of
Sections 2.15, 2.16 and 2.17 (subject to the requirements and limitations therein, including the requirements under Section 2.17(f) (it being understood that the documentation required under Section 2.17(f) shall be delivered to the
participating Lender)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section; provided that such Participant (A) agrees to be subject to the provisions of
Sections 2.18 and 2.19 as if it were an assignee under paragraph (b) of this Section; (B) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 2.15 or 2.17, with respect to any participation, than its participating
Lender would have been entitled to receive; and (C) a Participant shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.17 unless the Company is notified of the participation sold to such Participant. To the extent permitted by law, each
Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.08 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.18(d) as though it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a participation shall,
acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrowers, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participants interest in the
Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the 
  89 



Participant Register); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any
Participant or any information relating to a Participants interest in any Commitments, Loans, Letters of Credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish
that such Commitment, Loan, Letter of Credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and
such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative
Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.  (d)
Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including without limitation any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal
Reserve Bank or any central bank having jurisdiction over such Lender, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a
Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. 
SECTION 9.05. Survival. All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the Loan Parties in the Loan Documents
and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery
of the Loan Documents and the making of any Loans and issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender
may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any
fee or any other amount payable under this Agreement or any other Loan Document is outstanding and unpaid or any Letter of Credit is outstanding (other than unasserted indemnification, tax, gross-up, expense reimbursement or yield protection
obligations, in each case, for which no claim has been made) and so long as the Commitments have not expired or terminated. The provisions of Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03 and Article VIII shall survive and remain in full force and
effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination of the Letters of Credit and the Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or
any provision hereof or thereof.  SECTION 9.06. Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness; Electronic Execution. This Agreement
may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement, the other Loan
Documents and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the Administrative Agent constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and
understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. Except as provided in Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent
shall have received counterparts hereof which, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by telecopy, e-mailed .pdf or any other electronic means that reproduces an image of the actual executed signature page shall be effective as delivery of a manually
executed counterpart of this 
  90 



Agreement. The words execution, signed, signature, delivery, and words of like import in or relating to any document to be signed in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be deemed to include Electronic Signatures, deliveries or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a
manually executed signature, physical delivery thereof or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent and as provided for in any applicable law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National
Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act, or any other similar state laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act. 
SECTION 9.07. Severability. Any provision of any Loan Document held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction
shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions thereof; and the invalidity of a particular
provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction.  SECTION 9.08. Right of
Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender and each of its Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all
deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final and in whatever currency denominated) at any time held and other obligations at any time owing by such Lender or Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of any Borrower against
any of and all of the Obligations of such Borrower held by such Lender, irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand under the Loan Documents and although such obligations may be unmatured. The applicable Lender shall
promptly notify the Company and the Administrative Agent of such set-off or application; provided that any failure to give or any delay in giving such notice shall not affect the validity of any such set-off or application under this Section.
The rights of each Lender under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which such Lender may have. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or in the other Loan
Documents, the parties agree that: (a) the Initial Finnish Borrower, Health Sciences and any other Subsidiary that becomes a Subsidiary Borrower shall not be liable for any obligation of the Company or any other Subsidiary that becomes a
Subsidiary Borrower arising under or with respect to any of the Loan Documents; (b) the Initial Finnish Borrower, Health Sciences and each other Subsidiary that becomes a Subsidiary Borrower shall be severally liable only for the obligations of
each such Borrower, and shall not be a co-obligor or guarantor; and (c) neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender, nor any Affiliate thereof, may set-off or apply any deposits of, or any other obligations at the time owing to or for the
credit of the account of, the Initial Finnish Borrower, Health Sciences or any other Subsidiary that becomes a Subsidiary Borrower by the Administrative Agent, Lender of Affiliate thereof, against any or all of the obligations of the Company or any
other Subsidiary that is or becomes a Subsidiary Borrower.  SECTION 9.09. Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of
Process. (a) This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the law of the State of New York. 
(b) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the State of New York sitting in New York County, Borough of Manhattan, and of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to any Loan Document, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding
may be heard and determined in such New York State or, to the extent permitted by law, in such Federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be

  91 



enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall affect any right that the Administrative
Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any Loan Party or its properties in the courts of any jurisdiction. 
(c) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and
effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document in any court referred to in paragraph (b) of
this Section. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court. 
(d) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in
Section 9.01. Each Subsidiary Borrower irrevocably designates and appoints the Company, as its authorized agent, to accept and acknowledge on its behalf, service of any and all process which may be served in any suit, action or proceeding of
the nature referred to in Section 9.09(b) in any federal or New York State court sitting in New York City. The Company hereby represents, warrants and confirms that the Company has agreed to accept such appointment. Said designation and
appointment shall be irrevocable by each such Subsidiary Borrower until all Loans, all reimbursement obligations, interest thereon and all other amounts payable by such Subsidiary Borrower hereunder and under the other Loan Documents shall have been
paid in full in accordance with the provisions hereof and thereof and such Subsidiary Borrower shall have been terminated as a Borrower hereunder pursuant to Section 2.23. Each Subsidiary Borrower hereby consents to process being served in any
suit, action or proceeding of the nature referred to in Section 9.09(b) in any federal or New York State court sitting in New York City by service of process upon the Company as provided in this Section 9.09(d); provided that, to
the extent lawful and possible, notice of said service upon such agent shall be mailed by registered or certified air mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to the Company and (if applicable to) such Subsidiary Borrower at its address set
forth in the Borrowing Subsidiary Agreement to which it is a party or to any other address of which such Subsidiary Borrower shall have given written notice to the Administrative Agent (with a copy thereof to the Company). Each Subsidiary Borrower
irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, all claim of error by reason of any such service in such manner and agrees that such service shall be deemed in every respect effective service of process upon such Subsidiary Borrower in
any such suit, action or proceeding and shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be taken and held to be valid and personal service upon and personal delivery to such Subsidiary Borrower. To the extent any Subsidiary Borrower has or hereafter
may acquire any immunity from jurisdiction of any court or from any legal process (whether from service or notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of a judgment, execution or otherwise), each Subsidiary Borrower hereby
irrevocably waives, to the extent permitted by law, such immunity in respect of its obligations under the Loan Documents. Nothing in this Agreement or any other Loan Document will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in
any other manner permitted by law.  SECTION 9.10. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY (WHETHER
BASED ON 
  92 



CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER
PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.  SECTION 9.11. Headings. Article and Section headings and the Table of Contents used herein
are for convenience of reference only, are not part of this Agreement and shall not affect the construction of, or be taken into consideration in interpreting, this Agreement. 
SECTION 9.12. Confidentiality. Each of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders agrees to maintain the
confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its and its Affiliates directors, officers, employees and agents, including accountants, legal counsel and other advisors (it being
understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority
(including any self-regulatory authority, such as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners), (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process (in which case the Administrative
Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders agree (except with respect to any audit or examination conducted by bank accountants or any self regulatory authority or governmental or regulatory authority exercising examination or regulatory authority), to
the extent practicable (with respect to any bank regulatory authority) and not prohibited by applicable law, rule or regulation, to inform the Company promptly thereof and prior to the disclosure thereof), (d) to any other party to this
Agreement, (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies under this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder or
thereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section, to (i) any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations
under this Agreement or (ii) any actual or prospective counterparty (or its advisors) to any swap or derivative transaction relating to any Borrower and its obligations, (g) with the consent of the Company or (h) to the extent such
Information (i) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section or (ii) becomes available to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender, other than as a result of a breach of this Section, on a
nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Company (which source is not known by such recipient to be in breach of confidentiality obligations to the Company or any Subsidiary). For the purposes of this Section,
Information means all information received from the Company or any Subsidiary relating to the Company or any Subsidiary or any of their respective businesses, other than any such information that is available to the Administrative
Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the Company (other than any such information received from a source that is known by such recipient to be in breach of confidentiality obligations to the Company
or any Subsidiary). Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the
confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information.  EACH LENDER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT
INFORMATION AS DEFINED IN THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING PARAGRAPH FURNISHED TO IT PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT MAY INCLUDE MATERIAL NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION CONCERNING THE COMPANY AND ITS RELATED PARTIES OR THEIR RESPECTIVE SECURITIES, AND CONFIRMS THAT IT
HAS DEVELOPED COMPLIANCE PROCEDURES REGARDING 
  93 



THE USE OF MATERIAL NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION AND THAT IT WILL HANDLE SUCH MATERIAL NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THOSE PROCEDURES AND APPLICABLE LAW, INCLUDING FEDERAL AND STATE
SECURITIES LAWS.  ALL INFORMATION, INCLUDING REQUESTS FOR WAIVERS AND AMENDMENTS, FURNISHED BY THE COMPANY OR THE ADMINISTRATIVE
AGENT PURSUANT TO, OR IN THE COURSE OF ADMINISTERING, THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE SYNDICATE-LEVEL INFORMATION, WHICH MAY CONTAIN MATERIAL NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION ABOUT THE COMPANY, THE OTHER LOAN PARTIES AND THEIR RELATED PARTIES OR THEIR RESPECTIVE
SECURITIES. ACCORDINGLY, EACH LENDER REPRESENTS TO THE COMPANY AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT THAT IT HAS IDENTIFIED IN ITS ADMINISTRATIVE QUESTIONNAIRE A CREDIT CONTACT WHO MAY RECEIVE INFORMATION THAT MAY CONTAIN MATERIAL NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION IN
ACCORDANCE WITH ITS COMPLIANCE PROCEDURES AND APPLICABLE LAW.  SECTION 9.13. USA PATRIOT Act. Each Lender that is subject
to the requirements of the Patriot Act hereby notifies each Loan Party that pursuant to the requirements of the Patriot Act, it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies such Loan Party, which information includes the name
and address of such Loan Party and other information that will allow such Lender to identify such Loan Party in accordance with the Patriot Act. 
SECTION 9.14. Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if at any time the interest rate
applicable to any Loan, together with all fees, charges and other amounts which are treated as interest on such Loan under applicable law (collectively the Charges), shall exceed the maximum lawful rate (the Maximum
Rate) which may be contracted for, charged, taken, received or reserved by the Lender holding such Loan in accordance with applicable law, the rate of interest payable in respect of such Loan hereunder, together with all Charges payable in
respect thereof, shall be limited to the Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful, the interest and Charges that would have been payable in respect of such Loan but were not payable as a result of the operation of this Section shall be cumulated
and the interest and Charges payable to such Lender in respect of other Loans or periods shall be increased (but not above the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount, together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Effective Rate to
the date of repayment, shall have been received by such Lender.  SECTION 9.15. No Advisory or Fiduciary Responsibility. In
connection with all aspects of each transaction contemplated hereby (including in connection with any amendment, waiver or other modification hereof or of any other Loan Document), each Borrower acknowledges and agrees that: (i) (A) the
arranging and other services regarding this Agreement provided by the Lenders are arms-length commercial transactions between such Borrower and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Lenders and their Affiliates, on the other hand,
(B) such Borrower has consulted its own legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent it has deemed appropriate, and (C) such Borrower is capable of evaluating, and understands and accepts, the terms, risks and conditions of
the transactions contemplated hereby and by the other Loan Documents; (ii) (A) each of the Lenders and their Affiliates is and has been acting solely as a principal and, except as expressly agreed in writing by the relevant parties, has
not been, is not, and will not be acting as an advisor, agent or fiduciary for such Borrower or any of its Affiliates, or any other Person and (B) no Lender or any of its Affiliates has any obligation to such Borrower or any of its Affiliates
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby except, in the case of a Lender, those obligations expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents; and (iii) each of the Lenders and their respective Affiliates may be engaged in
a broad range of transactions that involve interests that differ 
  94 



from those of such Borrower and its Affiliates, and no Lender or any of its Affiliates has any obligation to disclose any of such interests to such Borrower or its Affiliates. To the fullest
extent permitted by law, each Borrower hereby waives and releases any claims that it may have against each of the Lenders and their Affiliates with respect to any breach or alleged breach of agency or fiduciary duty in connection with any aspect of
any transaction contemplated hereby.  ARTICLE X 
Company Guarantee 
SECTION 10.01. Guaranty. The Company hereby absolutely and unconditionally guarantees, as a guaranty of payment and performance
and not merely as a guaranty of collection, prompt payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by required prepayment, upon acceleration, demand or otherwise, and at all times thereafter, of any and all existing and future indebtedness and
liabilities of every kind, nature and character, direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, voluntary or involuntary and whether for principal, interest, premiums, fees indemnities, damages, costs, expenses or otherwise,
of the Subsidiary Borrowers to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders, arising hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including all renewals, extensions, amendments, refinancings and other modifications thereof and all
costs, attorneys fees and expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Lenders in connection with the collection or enforcement thereof), and whether recovery upon such indebtedness and liabilities may be or hereafter
become unenforceable or shall be an allowed or disallowed claim under any proceeding or case commenced by or against the Company or the other Loan Parties under Debtor Relief Laws, and including interest that accrues after the commencement by or
against the Company of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Laws (collectively, the Guaranteed Obligations). The Administrative Agents books and records showing the amount of the Guaranteed Obligations shall be admissible
in evidence in any action or proceeding, and shall be binding upon the Company, and conclusive for the purpose of establishing the amount of the Guaranteed Obligations. This Guaranty shall not be affected by the genuineness, validity, regularity or
enforceability of the Guaranteed Obligations or any instrument or agreement evidencing any Guaranteed Obligations, or by the existence, validity, enforceability, perfection, non-perfection or extent of any collateral therefor, or by any fact or
circumstance relating to the Guaranteed Obligations which might otherwise constitute a defense to the obligations of the Company under this Guaranty other than full payment and performance, and the Company hereby irrevocably waives any defenses it
may now have or hereafter acquire in any way relating to any or all of the foregoing.  SECTION 10.02. Rights of Lenders. The
Company consents and agrees that the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders may, at any time and from time to time, without notice or demand, and without affecting the enforceability or continuing effectiveness hereof:
(a) amend, extend, renew, compromise, discharge, accelerate or otherwise change the time for payment or the terms of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof, (b) take, hold, exchange, enforce, waive, release, fail to perfect, sell,
or otherwise dispose of any security for the payment of this Guaranty or any Guaranteed Obligations; (c) apply such security and direct the order or manner of sale thereof as the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders in their
sole discretion may determine; and (d) release or substitute one or more of any endorsers or other guarantors of any of the Guaranteed Obligations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company consents to the taking of, or
failure to take, any action which might in any manner or to any extent vary the risks of the Company under this Guaranty or which, but for this provision, might operate as a discharge of the Company. 
SECTION 10.03. Certain Waivers. The Company waives (a) any defense arising by reason of any disability or other defense of
the Subsidiary Borrowers or any other guarantor, or the 
  95 



cessation from any cause whatsoever (including any act or omission of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender) of the liability of the Subsidiary Borrowers; (b) any defense
based on any claim that the Companys obligations exceed or are more burdensome than those of the Subsidiary Borrowers; (c) the benefit of any statute of limitations affecting the Companys liability hereunder; (d) any right to
proceed against the Subsidiary Borrowers, proceed against or exhaust any security for the Indebtedness, or pursue any other remedy in the power of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender whatsoever; (e) any benefit of and any
right to participate in any security now or hereafter held by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender; (f) to the fullest extent permitted by law, any and all other defenses or benefits that may be derived from or afforded by
applicable law limiting the liability of or exonerating guarantors or sureties, (g) any defense arising from any change in corporate existence or structure of any Subsidiary Borrower and (h) any defense arising from any law, regulation,
decree or order of any jurisdiction or any event affecting any term of the Guaranteed Obligations. The Company expressly waives all setoffs and counterclaims and all presentments, demands for payment or performance, notices of nonpayment or
nonperformance, protests, notices of protest, notices of dishonor and all other notices or demands of any kind or nature whatsoever with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations, and all notices of acceptance of this Guaranty or of the existence,
creation or incurrence of new or additional Guaranteed Obligations.  SECTION 10.04. Obligations Independent. The obligations
of the Company under this Article X are those of primary obligor, and not merely as surety, and are independent of the Guaranteed Obligations and the obligations of any other guarantor, and a separate action may be brought against the
Company to enforce this Guaranty whether or not the Subsidiary Borrowers or any other person or entity is joined as a party. 
SECTION 10.05. Subrogation. The Company shall not exercise any right of subrogation, contribution, indemnity, reimbursement or
similar rights with respect to any payments it makes under this Guaranty until all of the Guaranteed Obligations and any amounts payable under this Guaranty have been indefeasibly paid and performed in full and the Commitments and the Facilities are
terminated. If any amounts are paid to the Company in violation of the foregoing limitation, then such amounts shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders and shall forthwith be paid to the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders to reduce the amount of the Guaranteed Obligations, whether matured or unmatured. 
SECTION 10.06. Termination; Reinstatement. This Guaranty is a continuing and irrevocable guaranty of all Guaranteed Obligations
now or hereafter existing and shall remain in full force and effect until all Guaranteed Obligations and any other amounts payable under this Guaranty are indefeasibly paid in full in cash and the Commitments with respect to the Guaranteed
Obligations are terminated. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Guaranty shall continue in full force and effect or be revived, as the case may be, if any payment by or on behalf of any Subsidiary Borrower or the Company is made, or any of the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Lenders exercises its right of setoff, in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations and such payment or the proceeds of such setoff or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent
or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by any of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Lenders in their discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in connection
with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Laws or otherwise, all as if such payment had not been made or such setoff had not occurred and whether or not the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders are in possession of or have
released this Guaranty and regardless of any prior revocation, rescission, termination or reduction. The obligations of the Company under this paragraph shall survive termination of this Guaranty. 
  96 


SECTION 10.07. Subordination. The Company hereby subordinates the payment of all
obligations and indebtedness of the Subsidiary Borrowers owing to the Company, whether now existing or hereafter arising, including but not limited to any obligation of the Subsidiary Borrowers to the Company as subrogee of the Administrative Agent,
the Issuing Bank and the Lenders or resulting from the Companys performance under this Guaranty, to the indefeasible payment in full in cash of all Guaranteed Obligations but nothing shall prevent payment by the Subsidiary Borrowers in respect
of such Indebtedness in the ordinary course so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing. If the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders so request after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
Default, any such obligation or indebtedness of the Subsidiary Borrowers to the Company shall be enforced and performance received by the Company as trustee for the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders and the proceeds thereof
shall be paid over to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders on account of the Guaranteed Obligations, but without reducing or affecting in any manner the liability of the Company under this Guaranty. 
SECTION 10.08. Stay of Acceleration. If acceleration of the time for payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is stayed, in
connection with any case commenced by or against the Company or any Subsidiary Borrower under any Debtor Relief Laws, or otherwise, all such amounts shall nonetheless be payable by the Company immediately upon demand by the Administrative Agent, the
Issuing Bank and the Lenders.  SECTION 10.09. Condition of Subsidiary Borrowers. The Company acknowledges and agrees that it
has the sole responsibility for, and has adequate means of, obtaining from the Subsidiary Borrowers and any other guarantor such information concerning the financial condition, business and operations of the Subsidiary Borrowers and any such other
guarantor as the Company requires, and that none of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders have any duty, and the Company is not relying on the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders at any time, to disclose to
the Company any information relating to the business, operations or financial condition of the Subsidiary Borrowers or any other guarantor (the Company waiving any duty on the part of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders to
disclose such information and any defense relating to the failure to provide the same).  [Signature Pages Follow]
