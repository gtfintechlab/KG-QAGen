If at any time any change in GAAP would affect the computation of any financial ratio or requirement set forth in any Loan Document, and either the Borrower or the Required Lenders shall so request, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Borrower shall negotiate in good faith to amend such ratio or requirement to preserve the original intent thereof in light of such change in GAAP (subject to the approval of the Required Lenders); provided that, until so amended, such ratio or requirement shall continue to be computed in accordance with GAAP prior to such change therein.43 Section 1.04    Rounding. Any financial ratios required to be maintained or complied with by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement (or required to be satisfied in order for a specific action to be permitted under this Agreement) shall be calculated by dividing the appropriate component by the other component, carrying the result to one place more than the number of places by which such ratio is expressed herein and rounding the result up or down to the nearest number (with a rounding-up if there is no nearest number).Section 1.05    Times of Day.  Unless otherwise specified, all references herein to times of day shall be references to Eastern time (daylight or standard, as applicable). Section 1.06     Letter of Credit Amounts. With respect to any Letter of Credit that, by its terms or the terms of any Issuer Document related thereto, pr

eement and the other Loan Documents (other than Articles 2, 9 and 10 hereof), where the permissibility of a transaction or determinations of required actions or circumstances depend upon compliance with, or are determined by reference to, amounts stated in Dollars, such amounts shall be deemed to refer to Dollars or Dollar Equivalents and any requisite currency translation shall be based on the Spot Rate in effect on the Business Day immediately preceding the date of such transaction or determination.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of determining compliance with Sections 7.01, 7.02 and 7.03 with respect to any amount of Liens, Indebtedness or Investment in currencies other than Dollars, no Default shall be deemed to have occurred solely as a result of changes in rates of exchange occurring after the time such Lien is created, Indebtedness is incurred or Investment is made. Each provision of this Agreement shall be subject to such reasonable changes of construction as the Administrative Agent may from time to time specify with the Borrower’s consent (not to be unreasonably withheld) to appropriately reflect a change in currency of any country and any relevant market conventions or practices relating to such change in currency.Section 1.08    Timing of Payment and Performance.  When the payment of any obligation or the performance of any covenant, duty or obligation is stated to be due or performance required on a day which is not a Business Day, the date of such payment (other than as described in the definition of Interest Period) or performance shall extend to the immediately succeeding Business Day.Section 1.09    Certain Calculations. (a)    All pro forma calculations permitted or required to be made by the Borrower or any Subsidiary pursuant to this Agreement shall include only those adjustments that have been certified by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower as having been prepared in good faith based upon reasonably detailed written assumptions believed by the Borr

forth in the third paragraph of the definition of “Consolidated EBITDA”;(iii)    in the event that Dispositions are made subsequent to the last day of the applicable Measurement Period for which such pro forma ratio is being calculated but on or prior to the relevant Ratio Calculation Date, then Consolidated EBITDA shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Consolidated EBITDA (if positive) attributable to the property that is the subject of such Disposition or increased by an amount equal to the Consolidated EBITDA (if negative) attributable thereto, in each case assuming such Disposition had been made on the first day of the applicable Measurement Period; and(iv)    for the avoidance of doubt, the cash used in connection with any transaction specified above shall be excluded from amounts that may be netted in the calculation of pro forma Consolidated Leverage Ratio or Senior Secured Leverage Ratio, as applicable.45 ARTICLE 2. THE COMMITMENTS AND CREDIT EXTENSIONS Section 2.01    The Revolving Credit Borrowings. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, each Revolving Credit Lender severally agrees to make loans (each such loan, a “Revolving Credit Loan”) to the Borrower in Dollars from time to time, on any Business Day during the Availability Period for the Revolving Credit Facility, in an aggregate amount not to exceed at any time outstanding the amount of such Revolving Credit Lender’s Revolving Credit Commitment; provided, however, that after giving effect to any Revolving Credit Borrowing, (i) the Total Revolving Credit Outstandings shall not exceed the aggregate amount of the Revolving Credit Lenders’ Revolving Credit Commitments at such time and (ii) the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Revolving Credit Loans of any Revolving Credit Lender plus such Revolving Credit Lender’s Applicable Percentage of the Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations plus such Revolving Credit Lender’s Applicable Percentage of all Swing Line Loans shall not exceed such Revolving Credit Lender’s Revolving Credit Commitment.  Within the limits of each Revolving Credit Lender’s Revolving Credit Commitment, and subject to the other terms and conditions hereof, the Borrower may borrow under this Section 2.01, prepay under Section 2.05, and reborrow under this Section 2.01. Revolving Credit Loans may be Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar Rate Loans, as further provided herein.Section 2.02    Borrowings, Conversions and Continuations of Loans.  (a)     Each Borrowing, each conversion of Revolving Credit Loans or Incremental Term Loans from one Type to the other, and each continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be made upon the Borrower’s irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent, which may be given by “pdf” or similar electronic format, in the form of a Committed Loan Notice or a Continuation/Conversion Notice, as applicable (each, a “Notice”). Each such Notice must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than (i) 11:00 a.m. three Business Days prior to the requested date of any Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans or of any conversion of Eurodollar Rate Loans to Base Rate Loans and (ii) 11:00 a.m. one Business Day prior to the requested date of any Borrowing of Base Rate Loans.  Each Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be in a minimum principal amount of $5,000,000 and whole multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof. Except as provided in Sections 2.03(c) and 2.04(c), each Borrowing of or conversion to Base Rate Loans shall be in a minimum principal amount of $1,000,000 or a whole multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof. Each Notice shall specify, as applicable, (1) whether the Borrower is requesting a Revolving Credit Borrowing, an Incremental Borrowing, a conversion of Revolving Credit Loans or Incremental Term Loans from one Type to the other, or a continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans, (2) the requested date of the Borrowing, conversion or continuation, as the case may be (which shall be a Business Day), (3) the principal amount of Loans to be borrowed, converted or continued, (4) the Type of Loans to be borrowed or to which existing Revolving Credit Loans or Incremental Term Loans are to be converted and (5) if applicable, the duration of the applicable Interest Period with respect thereto. If the Borrower fails to specify a Type of Loan in a Committed Loan Notice or if the Borrower fails to give a timely notice requesting a conversion or continuation, then the applicable Revolving Credit Loans or Incremental Term Loans shall be made as, or converted to, Base Rate Loans. Any such automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans shall be effective as of the last day of the Interest Period then in effect with respect to the applicable Eurodollar Rate Loans. If the Borrower requests a Borrowing of, conversion to, or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans in any such Committed Loan Notice or Continuation/Conversion Notice, as applicable, but fails to specify an Interest Period, it will be deemed to have specified an Interest Period of one month. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Swing Line Loan may not be converted to a Eurodollar Rate Loan.46 (b)    Following receipt of a Committed Loan Notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Appropriate Lender of the amount of its Applicable Percentage under the applicable Facility of the applicable Revolving Credit Loans or Incremental Term Loans, and if no timely notice of a conversion or continuation is provided by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the details of any automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans described in Section 2.02(a).  In the case of a Borrowing, each Appropriate Lender shall make the amount of its Loan available to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds at the Administrative Agent’s Office not later than 12:00 p.m. on the Business Day specified in the applicable Committed Loan Notice. Upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (or, if such Borrowing is to be made on the Closing Date, Section 4.01), the Administrative Agent shall make all funds so received available to the Borrower in like funds as received by the Administrative Agent by wire transfer of such funds in accordance with instructions provided to (and reasonably acceptable to) the Administrative Agent by the Borrower; provided, however, that if, on the date a Committed Loan Notice with respect to a Revolving Credit Borrowing is given by the Borrower, there are L/C Borrowings outstanding, then the proceeds of such Revolving Credit Borrowing, first, shall be applied to the payment in full of any such L/C Borrowings, and second, shall be made available to the Borrower as provided above. (c)    Except as otherwise provided herein, a Eurodollar Rate Loan may be continued or converted only on the last day of an Interest Period for such Eurodollar Rate Loan. During the existence of an Event of Default, no Loans may be requested as, converted to or continued as Eurodollar Rate Loans without the consent of the Required Lenders.(d)    The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the interest rate applicable to any Interest Period for Eurodollar Rate Loans upon determination of such interest rate. At any time that Base Rate Loans are outstanding, the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders of any change in the Prime Rate used in determining the Base Rate promptly following the public announcement of such change.(e)    After giving effect to all Borrowings, all conversions of Loans from one Type to the other, and all continuations of Loans as the same Type, there shall not be more than ten (10) Interest Periods in effect at any one time. Section 2.03    Letters of Credit.  (a)    The Letter of Credit Commitment.    (i) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, (A) the L/C Issuer agrees, in reliance upon the agreements of the Revolving Credit Lenders set forth in this Section 2.03, (1) from time to time on any Business Day during the period from the Closing Date until the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, to issue Letters of Credit for the account of the Borrower, and to amend or extend Letters of Credit previously issued by it, in accordance with Section 2.03(b), and (2) to honor drawings under the Letters of Credit; and (B) the Revolving Credit Lenders severally agree to participate in Letters of Credit issued for the account of the Borrower and any drawings thereunder; provided that after giving effect to any L/C Credit Extension with respect to any Letter of Credit, (x) the Total Revolving Credit Outstandings shall not exceed the aggregate amount of the Revolving Credit Lenders’ Revolving Credit Commitments at such time, (y) the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Revolving Credit Loans of any Revolving Credit Lender, plus such Revolving Credit Lender’s Applicable Percentage of the Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations, plus such Revolving Credit Lender’s Applicable Percentage of the Outstanding Amount of all Swing Line Loans shall not exceed such Revolving Credit Lender’s Revolving Credit Commitment and (z) the Outstanding Amount of the L/C Obligations shall not exceed the Letter of Credit Sublimit.  Each request by the Borrower for the issuance or amendment of a Letter of Credit shall be deemed to be a representation by the Borrower that the L/C Credit Extension so requested complies with the conditions set forth in the proviso to the preceding sentence. Within the foregoing limits, and subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Borrower’s ability to obtain Letters of Credit shall be fully revolving, and accordingly the Borrower may, during the foregoing period, obtain Letters of Credit to replace Letters of Credit that have expired or that have been drawn upon and reimbursed. 47 (ii)    The L/C Issuer shall not issue any Letter of Credit if:(A)        subject to Section 2.03(b)(iii), the expiry date of such requested Letter of Credit would occur more than twelve months after the date of issuance or last extension, unless the Required Revolving Credit Lenders have approved such expiry date; or(B)        the expiry date of such requested Letter of Credit would occur after the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, unless such Letter of Credit is Cash Collateralized at 105% of the face amount thereof.(iii)    The L/C Issuer shall not be under any obligation to issue any Letter of Credit if:(A)        any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain the L/C Issuer from issuing such Letter of Credit, or any Law applicable to the L/C Issuer or any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over the L/C Issuer shall prohibit, or request that the L/C Issuer refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit generally or such Letter of Credit in particular or shall impose upon the L/C Issuer with respect to such Letter of Credit any restriction, reserve or capital requirement (for which the L/C Issuer is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the Closing Date, or shall impose upon the L/C Issuer any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not applicable on the Closing Date and which the L/C Issuer in good faith deems material to it; 48 (B)        the issuance of such Letter of Credit would violate one or more policies of the L/C Issuer applicable to letters of credit generally; (C)        except as otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer, such Letter of Credit is in an initial stated amount less than $100,000;(D)        such Letter of Credit is to be denominated in a currency other than Dollars; or(E)        any Revolving Credit Lender is at that time a Defaulting Lender, unless the L/C Issuer has entered into arrangements, including the delivery of Cash Collateral, satisfactory to the L/C Issuer (in its sole discretion) with the Borrower or such Revolving Credit Lender to eliminate the L/C Issuer’s actual or potential Fronting Exposure (after giving effect to any required adjustment pursuant to Section 2.16(a)(iv)) with respect to the Defaulting Lender arising from the Letter of Credit then proposed to be issued and all other L/C Obligations as to which the L/C Issuer has actual or potential Fronting Exposure, as it may elect in its sole discretion.(iv)    The L/C Issuer shall not amend any Letter of Credit if the L/C Issuer would not be permitted at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its amended form under the terms hereof.(v)    The L/C Issuer shall be under no obligation to amend any Letter of Credit if (A) the L/C Issuer would have no obligation at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its amended form under the terms hereof, or (B) the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit does not accept the proposed amendment to such Letter of Credit.(vi)    The L/C Issuer shall act on behalf of the Revolving Credit Lenders with respect to any Letters of Credit issued by it and the documents associated therewith, and the L/C Issuer shall have all of the benefits and immunities (A) provided to the Administrative Agent in Article 9 with respect to any acts taken or omissions suffered by the L/C Issuer in connection with Letters of Credit issued by it or proposed to be issued by it and the Issuer Documents pertaining to such Letters of Credit as fully as if the term “Administrative Agent” as used in Article 9 included the L/C Issuer with respect to such acts or omissions, and (B) as additionally provided herein with respect to the L/C Issuer.(b)    Procedures for Issuance and Amendment of Letters of Credit; Auto-Extension Letters of Credit.    (i) Each Letter of Credit shall be issued or amended, as the case may be, upon the request of the Borrower delivered to the L/C Issuer (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) in the form of a Letter of Credit Application, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower. Such Letter of Credit Application must be received by the L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent not later than 12:00 p.m. at least three Business Days (or such later date and time as the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer may agree in a particular instance in their sole discretion) prior to the proposed issuance date or date of amendment, as the case may be. In the case of a request for an initial issuance of a Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Application shall specify in form and detail reasonably satisfactory to the L/C Issuer: (A) the proposed issuance date of the requested Letter of Credit (which shall be a Business Day); (B) the amount thereof; (C) the expiry date thereof; (D) the name and address of the beneficiary thereof; (E) the documents to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; (F) the full text of any certificate to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; (G) the purpose and nature of the requested Letter of Credit; and (H) such other matters as the L/C Issuer may reasonably require. In the case of a request for an amendment of any outstanding Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Application shall specify in form and detail reasonably satisfactory to the L/C Issuer: (A) the Letter of Credit to be amended; (B) the proposed date of amendment thereof (which shall be a Business Day); (C) the nature of the proposed amendment; and (D) such other matters as the L/C Issuer may reasonably require. Additionally, the Borrower shall furnish to the L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent such other documents and information pertaining to such requested Letter of Credit issuance or amendment, including any Issuer Documents, as the L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent may reasonably require.49 (ii)    Promptly after receipt of any Letter of Credit Application, the L/C Issuer will confirm with the Administrative Agent (in writing) that the Administrative Agent has received a copy of such Letter of Credit Application from the Borrower and, if not, the L/C Issuer will provide the Administrative Agent with a copy thereof. Unless the L/C Issuer has received written notice from any Revolving Credit Lender, the Administrative Agent or any Loan Party, at least one Business Day prior to the requested date of issuance or amendment of the applicable Letter of Credit, that one or more applicable conditions contained in Article 4 shall not then be satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the L/C Issuer shall, on the requested date, issue a Letter of Credit for the account of the Borrower or enter into the applicable amendment, as the case may be, in each case in accordance with the L/C Issuer’s usual and customary business practices. Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each Revolving Credit Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the L/C Issuer a risk participation in such Letter of Credit in an amount equal to the product of such Revolving Credit Lender’s Applicable Percentage times the amount of such Letter of Credit.(iii)    If the Borrower so requests in any applicable Letter of Credit Application, the L/C Issuer may, in its sole and absolute discretion, agree to issue a Letter of Credit that has automatic extension provisions (each, an “Auto-Extension Letter of Credit”); provided that, unless otherwise agreed to by the L/C Issuer, any such Auto-Extension Letter of Credit must permit the L/C Issuer to prevent any such extension at least once in each twelve-month period (commencing with the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit) by giving prior notice to the beneficiary thereof not later than a day (the “Non-Extension Notice Date”) in each such twelve-month period to be agreed upon at the time such Letter of Credit is issued. Unless otherwise directed by the L/C Issuer, the Borrower shall not be required to make a specific request to the L/C Issuer for any such extension. Once an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit has been issued, the Revolving Credit Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) the L/C Issuer to permit the extension of such Letter of Credit at any time to an expiry date not later than the Letter of Credit Expiration Date unless such Letter of Credit is Cash Collateralized at 105% of the face amount thereof; provided, however, that the L/C Issuer shall not permit any such extension if (A) the L/C Issuer has determined that it would not be permitted, or would have no obligation at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its revised form (as extended) under the terms hereof (by reason of the provisions of clause (ii) or (iii) of Section 2.03(a) or otherwise), or (B) it has received notice (in writing) on or before the day that is seven days before the Non-Extension Notice Date (1) from the Administrative Agent that the Required Revolving Credit Lenders have elected not to permit such extension or (2) from the Administrative Agent, any Revolving Credit Lender or the Borrower that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in Section 4.02 is not then satisfied, and in each such case directing the L/C Issuer not to permit such extension.50 (iv)    Promptly after its delivery of any Letter of Credit or any amendment to a Letter of Credit to an advising bank with respect thereto or to the beneficiary thereof, the L/C Issuer will also deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent a true and complete copy of such Letter of Credit or amendment.(c)    Drawings and Reimbursements; Funding of Participations.    (i) Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit of any notice of a drawing under such Letter of Credit, the L/C Issuer shall notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent thereof. Not later than 11:00 a.m. on the next Business Day following any payment by the L/C Issuer under a Letter of Credit (or on the second Business Day following any payment by the L/C Issuer if such notice is delivered to the Borrower after 11:00 a.m. on the date of any such payment) (each such applicable date, an “Honor Date”), the Borrower shall reimburse the L/C Issuer through the Administrative Agent in an amount equal to the amount of such drawing in Dollars. If the Borrower fails to so reimburse the L/C Issuer by such time, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Revolving Credit Lender of the Honor Date, the amount of the unreimbursed drawing (the “Unreimbursed Amount”), and the amount of such Revolving Credit Lender’s Applicable Percentage thereof. In such event, the Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a Revolving Credit Borrowing of Base Rate Loans to be disbursed on the Honor Date in an amount equal to the Unreimbursed Amount, without regard to the minimum and multiples specified in Section 2.02 for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans, but subject to the amount of the unutilized portion of the Revolving Credit Commitments and the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (other than the delivery of a Committed Loan Notice). (ii)    Each Revolving Credit Lender shall upon any notice pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(i) make funds available (and the Administrative Agent may apply Cash Collateral provided for this purpose) for the account of the L/C Issuer at the Administrative Agent’s Office in an amount equal to its Applicable Percentage of the Unreimbursed Amount not later than 12:00 p.m. on the Business Day specified in such notice by the Administrative Agent, whereupon, subject to the provisions of Section 2.03(c)(iii), each Revolving Credit Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Loan to the Borrower in such amount. The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the L/C Issuer in Dollars.(iii)    With respect to any Unreimbursed Amount that is not fully refinanced by a Revolving Credit Borrowing of Base Rate Loans because the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 cannot be satisfied or for any other reason, the Borrower shall be deemed to have incurred from the L/C Issuer an L/C Borrowing in the amount of the Unreimbursed Amount that is not so refinanced, which L/C Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the Default Rate. In such event, each Revolving Credit Lender’s payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(ii) shall be deemed payment in respect of its participation in such L/C Borrowing and shall constitute an L/C Advance from such Revolving Credit Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this Section 2.03.51 (iv)    Until each Revolving Credit Lender funds its Revolving Credit Loan or L/C Advance pursuant to this Section 2.03(c) to reimburse the L/C Issuer for any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of such Revolving Credit Lender’s Applicable Percentage of such amount shall be solely for the account of the L/C Issuer.(v)    Each Revolving Credit Lender’s obligation to make Revolving Credit Loans or L/C Advances to reimburse the L/C Issuer for amounts drawn under Letters of Credit, as contemplated by this Section 2.03(c), shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against the L/C Issuer, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default; or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; provided, however, that each Revolving Credit Lender’s obligation to make Revolving Credit Loans pursuant to this Section 2.03(c) is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (other than delivery by the Borrower of a Committed Loan Notice). No such making of an L/C Advance shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrower to reimburse the L/C Issuer for the amount of any payment made by the L/C Issuer under any Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided herein.(vi)    If any Revolving Credit Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer any amount required to be paid by such Revolving Credit Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.03(c) by the time specified in Section 2.03(c)(ii), the L/C Issuer shall be entitled to recover from such Revolving Credit Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the L/C Issuer at a rate per annum equal to the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the L/C Issuer in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the L/C Issuer in connection with the foregoing. If such Revolving Credit Lender pays such amount (with interest and fees as aforesaid), the amount so paid shall constitute such Revolving Credit Lender’s Revolving Credit Loan included in the relevant Revolving Credit Borrowing or L/C Advance in respect of the relevant L/C Borrowing, as the case may be. A certificate of the L/C Issuer submitted to any Revolving Credit Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this Section 2.03(c)(vi) shall be conclusive absent manifest error.52 (d)    Repayment of Participations.    (i) At any time after the L/C Issuer has made a payment under any Letter of Credit and has received from any Revolving Credit Lender such Revolving Credit Lender’s L/C Advance in respect of such payment in accordance with Section 2.03(c), if the Administrative Agent receives for the account of the L/C Issuer any payment in respect of the related Unreimbursed Amount or interest thereon (whether directly from the Borrower or otherwise, including proceeds of Cash Collateral applied thereto by the Administrative Agent), the Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to such Revolving Credit Lender its Applicable Percentage thereof in the same funds as those received by the Administrative Agent.(ii)    If any payment received by the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(i) is required to be returned under any of the circumstances described in Section 10.05 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the L/C Issuer in its discretion), each Revolving Credit Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer its Applicable Percentage thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned by such Revolving Credit Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Effective Rate from time to time in effect. The obligations of the Revolving Credit Lenders under this clause shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.(e)    Obligations Absolute. The obligation of the Borrower to reimburse the L/C Issuer for each drawing under each Letter of Credit and to repay each L/C Borrowing shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all circumstances, including the following:(i)    any lack of validity or enforceability of such Letter of Credit, this Agreement, or any other Loan Document;(ii)    the existence of any claim, counterclaim, setoff, defense or other right that the Borrower or any Subsidiary may have at any time against any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), the L/C Issuer or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or by such Letter of Credit or any agreement or instrument relating thereto, or any unrelated transaction;(iii)    any draft, demand, certificate or other document presented under such Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; or any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under such Letter of Credit;(iv)    any payment by the L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or certificate that does not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; or any payment made by the L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit to any Person purporting to be a trustee in bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidator, receiver or other representative of or successor to any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit, including any arising in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law; or53 (v)    any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, including any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries.The Borrower shall promptly examine a copy of each Letter of Credit and each amendment thereto that is delivered to it and, in the event of any claim of noncompliance with the Borrower’s instructions or other irregularity, the Borrower will promptly notify the L/C Issuer. The Borrower shall be conclusively deemed to have waived any such claim against the L/C Issuer and its correspondents unless such notice is given as aforesaid or such claim arises from the L/C Issuer’s gross negligence or willful misconduct (as determined by a final order of a court of competent jurisdiction).(f)    Role of L/C Issuer. Each Lender and the Borrower agree that, in paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit, the L/C Issuer shall not have any responsibility to obtain any document (other than any sight draft, certificates and documents expressly required by the Letter of Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such document or the authority of the Person executing or delivering any such document. None of the L/C Issuer, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of the L/C Issuer shall be liable to any Lender for (i) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the approval of the Revolving Credit Lenders or the Required Revolving Credit Lenders, as applicable; (ii) any action taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (iii) the due execution, effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any document or instrument related to any Letter of Credit or Issuer Document. The Borrower hereby assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit; provided, however, that this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude the Borrower’s pursuing such rights and remedies as it may have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other agreement. None of the L/C Issuer, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of the L/C Issuer shall be liable or responsible for any of the matters described in clauses (i) through (v) of Section 2.03(e); provided, however, that anything in such clauses to the contrary notwithstanding, the Borrower may have a claim against the L/C Issuer, and the L/C Issuer may be liable to the Borrower, to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to consequential or exemplary, damages suffered by the Borrower which are determined by a final order of a court of competent jurisdiction to have been caused by the L/C Issuer’s willful misconduct or gross negligence or the L/C Issuer’s willful failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the beneficiary of a sight draft and certificate(s) strictly complying with the terms and conditions of a Letter of Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the L/C Issuer may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and the L/C Issuer shall not be responsible for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason.54 (g)    Applicability of ISP. Unless otherwise expressly agreed by the L/C Issuer and the Borrower when a Letter of Credit is issued, the rules of the ISP shall apply to each Letter of Credit.(h)    Letter of Credit Fees. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Credit Lender in accordance with its Applicable Percentage a Letter of Credit fee (the “Letter of Credit Fee”) for each Letter of Credit equal to the Applicable Rate times the daily amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit; provided that any Letter of Credit Fees otherwise payable for the account of a Defaulting Lender with respect to any Letter of Credit as to which such Defaulting Lender has not provided Cash Collateral satisfactory to the L/C Issuer pursuant to this Section 2.03 shall be payable, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, to the other Revolving Credit Lenders in accordance with the upward adjustments in their respective Applicable Percentages allocable to such Letter of Credit pursuant to Section 2.16(a)(iv), with the balance of such fee, if any, payable to the L/C Issuer for its own account. For purposes of computing the daily amount available to be drawn under any Letter of Credit, the amount of such Letter of Credit shall be determined in accordance with Section 1.06. Letter of Credit Fees shall be (i) due and payable on the last Business Day of each December, March, June, and September, commencing with the first such date to occur after the issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the Letter of Credit Expiration Date and thereafter on demand and (ii) computed on a quarterly basis in arrears. If there is any change in the Applicable Rate during any quarter, the daily amount available to be drawn under each Letter of Credit shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Rate separately for each period during such quarter that such Applicable Rate was in effect.(i)    Fronting Fee and Documentary and Processing Charges Payable to L/C Issuer. The Borrower shall pay directly to the L/C Issuer for its own account a fronting fee with respect to each Letter of Credit, at a rate per annum of 0.125%, computed on the daily amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit on a quarterly basis in arrears. Such fronting fee shall be due and payable on the last Business Day of each December, March, June and September in respect of the most recently-ended quarterly period (or portion thereof, in the case of the first payment), commencing with the first such date to occur after the issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the Letter of Credit Expiration Date and thereafter on demand. For purposes of computing the daily amount available to be drawn under any Letter of Credit, the amount of such Letter of Credit shall be determined in accordance with Section 1.06.  In addition, the Borrower shall pay directly to the L/C Issuer for its own account the customary issuance, presentation, amendment and other processing fees, and other standard costs and charges, of the L/C Issuer relating to letters of credit as from time to time in effect. Such customary fees and standard costs and charges are due and payable on demand and are nonrefundable.(j)    Conflict with Issuer Documents. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the terms hereof and the terms of any Issuer Document, the terms hereof shall control.  To the extent any defaults, representations, or covenants contained in any Issuer Documents are more restrictive than the Events of Default, representations, or covenants contained herein, the Events of Default, representations and covenants herein shall control.55 (k)    Additional L/C Issuers.  The Borrower may, at any time and from time to time, designate one or more additional Revolving Credit Lenders or Affiliates of Revolving Credit Lenders to act as a letter of credit issuer under the terms of this Agreement, with the consent of each of the Administrative Agent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), the other L/C Issuers (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) and such Revolving Credit Lender(s) or Affiliate thereof.  Any Revolving Credit Lender or Affiliate thereof designated as a letter of credit issuer pursuant to this Section 2.03(k) shall be deemed to be the L/C Issuer with respect to Letters of Credit issued or to be issued by such Revolving Credit Lender, and all references herein and in the other Loan Documents to the term “L/C Issuer” shall, with respect to such Letters of Credit, be deemed to refer to such Revolving Credit Lender in its capacity as L/C Issuer thereof, as the context shall require.Section 2.04    Swing Line Loans.    (a)  The Swing Line. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Swing Line Lender, in reliance upon the agreements of the other Lenders set forth in this Section 2.04, may in its sole discretion make loans (each such loan, a “Swing Line Loan”) to the Borrower from time to time in Dollars on any Business Day during the Availability Period with respect to the Revolving Credit Facility in an aggregate amount not to exceed at any time outstanding the amount of the Swing Line Sublimit, notwithstanding the fact that such Swing Line Loans, when aggregated with the Applicable Percentage of the Outstanding Amount of Revolving Credit Loans and L/C Obligations of the Lender acting as Swing Line Lender, may exceed the amount of such Lender’s Revolving Credit Commitment; provided, however, that after giving effect to any Swing Line Loan, (i) the Total Revolving Credit Outstandings shall not exceed the aggregate amount of the Revolving Credit Lenders’ Revolving Credit Commitments at such time, and (ii) the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Revolving Credit Loans of any Revolving Credit Lender at such time, plus such Revolving Credit Lender’s Applicable Percentage of the Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations at such time, plus such Revolving Credit Lender’s Applicable Percentage of the Outstanding Amount of all Swing Line Loans at such time shall not exceed such Lender’s Revolving Credit Commitment, and provided, further, that the Borrower shall not use the proceeds of any Swing Line Loan to refinance any outstanding Swing Line Loan. Within the foregoing limits, and subject to the other terms and conditions hereof, the Borrower may borrow under this Section 2.04, prepay under Section 2.05, and reborrow under this Section 2.04. Each Swing Line Loan shall bear interest only at a rate based on the Base Rate. Immediately upon the making of a Swing Line Loan, each Revolving Credit Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the Swing Line Lender a risk participation in such Swing Line Loan in an amount equal to the product of such Revolving Credit Lender’s Applicable Percentage times the amount of such Swing Line Loan.(b)    Borrowing Procedures.  Each Swing Line Borrowing shall be made upon the Borrower’s irrevocable notice to the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent, which may be given by “pdf” or similar electronic format. Each such notice must be received by the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent not later than 12:00 p.m. on the requested borrowing date, and shall specify (i) the amount to be borrowed, which shall be a minimum of $500,000 and whole multiples of $100,000 in excess of that amount, and (ii) the requested borrowing date, which shall be a Business Day. Unless the Swing Line Lender has received notice from the Administrative Agent (including at the request of any Revolving Credit Lender) prior to 2:00 p.m. on the date of the proposed Swing Line Borrowing (A) directing the Swing Line Lender not to make such Swing Line Loan as a result of the limitations set forth in the first proviso to the first sentence of Section 2.04(a), or (B) that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in Article 4 is not then satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Swing Line Lender will, not later than 2:00 p.m. on the borrowing date specified in such Swing Line Loan Notice, make the amount of its Swing Line Loan available to the Borrower by wire transfer of such funds in accordance with instructions provided to (and reasonably acceptable to) the Administrative Agent by the Borrower.56 (c)    Refinancing of Swing Line Loans.    (i)  The Swing Line Lender at any time in its sole and absolute discretion may request, and shall on the date ten Business Days after any Swing Line Loan is made automatically be deemed to have requested, on behalf of the Borrower (which hereby irrevocably authorizes the Swing Line Lender to so request on its behalf), that each Revolving Credit Lender make a Base Rate Loan in an amount equal to such Revolving Credit Lender’s Applicable Percentage of the amount of Swing Line Loans then outstanding. Such request shall be made in writing (which written request shall be deemed to be a Committed Loan Notice for purposes hereof) and in accordance with the requirements of Section 2.02, without regard to the minimum and multiples specified therein for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans, but subject to the unutilized portion of the Revolving Credit Facility and the conditions set forth in Section 4.02. The Swing Line Lender shall furnish the Borrower with a copy of the applicable Committed Loan Notice promptly after delivering such notice to the Administrative Agent. Each Revolving Credit Lender shall make an amount equal to its Applicable Percentage of the amount specified in such Committed Loan Notice available to the Administrative Agent in Dollars in immediately available funds (and the Administrative Agent may apply Cash Collateral available with respect to the applicable Swing Line Loan) for the account of the Swing Line Lender at the Administrative Agent’s Office not later than 12:00 p.m. on the day specified in such Committed Loan Notice, whereupon, subject to Section 2.04(c)(ii), each Revolving Credit Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Loan to the Borrower in such amount. The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the Swing Line Lender.(ii)    If for any reason any Swing Line Loan cannot be refinanced by such a Revolving Credit Borrowing in accordance with Section 2.04(c)(i), the request (or, if no request has been submitted, the deemed request) for Base Rate Loans submitted by the Swing Line Lender as set forth herein shall be deemed to be a request by the Swing Line Lender that each of the Revolving Credit Lenders fund its risk participation in the relevant Swing Line Loan and each Revolving Credit Lender’s payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swing Line Lender pursuant to Section 2.04(c)(i) shall be deemed payment in respect of such participation.(iii)    If any Revolving Credit Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swing Line Lender any amount required to be paid by such Revolving Credit Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.04(c) by the time specified in Section 2.04(c)(i), the Swing Line Lender shall be entitled to recover from such Revolving Credit Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the Swing Line Lender at a rate per annum equal to the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Swing Line Lender in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Swing Line Lender in connection with the foregoing. If such Revolving Credit Lender pays such amount (with interest and fees as aforesaid), the amount so paid shall constitute such Revolving Credit Lender’s Revolving Credit Loan included in the relevant Revolving Credit Borrowing or funded participation in the relevant Swing Line Loan, as the case may be. A certificate of the Swing Line Lender submitted to any Revolving Credit Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (iii) shall be conclusive absent manifest error.57 (iv)    Each Revolving Credit Lender’s obligation to make Revolving Credit Loans or to purchase and fund risk participations in Swing Line Loans pursuant to this Section 2.04(c) shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Revolving Credit Lender may have against the Swing Line Lender, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; provided, however, that each Revolving Credit Lender’s obligation to make Revolving Credit Loans pursuant to this Section 2.04(c) is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 4.02. No such funding of risk participations shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrower to repay Swing Line Loans, together with interest as provided herein.(d)    Repayment of Participations.    (i)  At any time after any Revolving Credit Lender has purchased and funded a risk participation in a Swing Line Loan, if the Swing Line Lender receives any payment on account of such Swing Line Loan, the Swing Line Lender will distribute to such Revolving Credit Lender its Applicable Percentage thereof in the same funds as those received by the Swing Line Lender.(ii)    If any payment received by the Swing Line Lender in respect of principal or interest on any Swing Line Loan is required to be returned by the Swing Line Lender under any of the circumstances described in Section 10.05 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Swing Line Lender in its discretion), each Revolving Credit Lender shall pay to the Swing Line Lender its Applicable Percentage thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Effective Rate. The Administrative Agent will make such demand upon the request of the Swing Line Lender. The obligations of the Lenders under this clause shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.(e)    Interest for Account of Swing Line Lender. Until each Revolving Credit Lender funds its Base Rate Loan or risk participation pursuant to this Section 2.04 to refinance such Revolving Credit Lender’s Applicable Percentage of any Swing Line Loan, interest in respect of such Applicable Percentage shall be solely for the account of the Swing Line Lender.(f)    Payments Directly to Swing Line Lender. The Borrower shall make all payments of principal and interest in respect of the Swing Line Loans directly to the Swing Line Lender.58 Section 2.05    Prepayments. (a)    Optional.    (i)  The Borrower may, upon notice in the form of a Prepayment Notice delivered to the Administrative Agent, at any time or from time to time voluntarily prepay Revolving Credit Loans or Incremental Term Loans in whole or in part without premium or penalty (other than, in the case of any Eurodollar Rate Loan, any amounts required pursuant to Section 3.05 and, in the case of any Incremental Term Loans, any premium contained in the applicable Joinder Agreement); provided that (A) such notice must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 12:00 p.m. (1) three Business Days prior to any date of prepayment of Eurodollar Rate Loans and (2) one Business Day prior to any date of prepayment of Base Rate Loans; (B) any prepayment of Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof; and (C) any prepayment of Base Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof or, in each case, if less, the entire principal amount thereof then outstanding. Each such notice shall specify (i) the date and amount of such prepayment and (ii) the Type(s) of Loans to be prepaid and, if Eurodollar Rate Loans are to be prepaid, the Interest Period(s) of such Loans. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Lender of its receipt of each such notice, and of the amount of such Lender’s ratable portion of such prepayment (based on such Lender’s Applicable Percentage in respect of the relevant Facility). If such notice is given by the Borrower, the Borrower shall make such prepayment and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein. Any voluntary prepayment of a Loan pursuant to this Section 2.05(a)(i) shall be accompanied by all accrued interest on the amount prepaid, together with any additional amounts if required pursuant to Section 3.05. Subject to Section 2.16, each such prepayment of the outstanding Incremental Term Loans pursuant to this Section 2.05(a)(i) shall be applied as directed by the Borrower to the installments thereof. All payments made pursuant to this Section 2.05(a) shall be applied on a pro rata basis to each Lender holding Loans of the applicable Facility being prepaid.(ii)    The Borrower may, upon notice in the form of a Swing Line Loan Prepayment Notice delivered to the Swing Line Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at any time or from time to time, voluntarily prepay Swing Line Loans in whole or in part without premium or penalty; provided that (A) such notice must be received by the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent not later than 12:00 p.m. on the date of the prepayment, and (B) any such prepayment shall be in a minimum principal amount of $500,000 and in integral multiples of $100,000. Each such notice shall specify the date and amount of such prepayment. If such notice is given by the Borrower, the Borrower shall make such prepayment and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein.(b)    Mandatory. (i)    Upon the incurrence or issuance by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries of any Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness expressly permitted to be incurred or issued pursuant to Section 7.03) the Borrower shall prepay (or Cash Collateralize, as applicable) an aggregate principal amount of Pro Rata Obligations equal to 100% of the gross cash proceeds received by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries therefrom less all reasonable and customary out-of-pocket legal, underwriting and other fees, costs and expenses incurred or reasonably anticipated to be incurred within 90 days thereof in connection therewith immediately upon receipt thereof by the Borrower or such Subsidiary (such prepayments (or Cash Collateralization) to be applied as set forth in clauses (ii) and (iv) below).59 (ii)    Each prepayment (or Cash Collateralization, as applicable) of Pro Rata Obligations pursuant to this Section 2.05(b) shall be applied, first, to the Incremental Term Loans held by all Incremental Term Loan Lenders in accordance with their Applicable Percentages (allocated pro rata to principal repayment installments thereof as set forth in the applicable Joinder Agreement), second, any excess after the application of such proceeds in accordance with clause first above, to the Revolving Credit Facility in the manner set forth in clause (iv) of this Section 2.05(b) and third, any excess after the application of such proceeds in accordance with clauses first and second above may be retained by the Borrower. Any prepayment of a Loan pursuant to this Section 2.05(b) shall be accompanied by all accrued interest on the amount prepaid, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.05.(iii)    If for any reason the Total Revolving Credit Outstandings at any time exceed the Revolving Credit Commitments at such time, the Borrower shall immediately prepay Revolving Credit Loans, Swing Line Loans and L/C Borrowings and/or Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations (other than the L/C Borrowings) (in an aggregate amount equal to 105% of the face amount thereof) in an aggregate amount sufficient to reduce the Total Revolving Credit Outstandings to the aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments.  If for any reason the Outstanding Amount of L/C Obligations at any time exceed the Letter of Credit Sublimit at such time, the Borrower shall immediately prepay L/C Borrowings and/or Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations in an aggregate amount sufficient to reduce the Outstanding Amount of L/C Obligations to the Letter of Credit Sublimit.  If for any reason the Outstanding Amount of Swing Line Loans at any time exceeds the Swing Line Sublimit at such time, the Borrower shall immediately prepay Swing Line Loans in an aggregate amount sufficient to reduce the Outstanding Amount of Swing Line Loans to the Swing Line Sublimit.(iv)    Prepayments of the Revolving Credit Facility made pursuant to this Section 2.05(b), first, shall be applied ratably to the L/C Borrowings and the Swing Line Loans, second, shall be applied ratably to the outstanding Revolving Credit Loans held by all Revolving Credit Lenders in accordance with their Applicable Percentages, and, third, shall be used to Cash Collateralize the remaining L/C Obligations. Upon the drawing of any Letter of Credit that has been Cash Collateralized, the funds held as Cash Collateral shall be applied (without any further action by or notice to or from the Borrower or any other Loan Party) to reimburse the L/C Issuer or the Revolving Credit Lenders, as applicable. Prepayments of the Revolving Credit Facility made pursuant to this Section 2.05(b) shall be applied ratably to the outstanding Revolving Credit Loans.  Amounts to be applied pursuant to this Section 2.05(b) to the mandatory prepayment of Incremental Term Loans and Revolving Credit Loans shall be applied, as applicable, first to reduce outstanding Base Rate Loans and any amounts remaining after such application shall be applied to prepay Eurodollar Rate Loans.60 Section 2.06    Termination or Reduction of Commitments.  (a)    Optional.  The Borrower may, upon notice to the Administrative Agent, terminate the Revolving Credit Facility, the Letter of Credit Sublimit or the Swing Line Sublimit, or from time to time permanently reduce the Revolving Credit Commitments, the Letter of Credit Sublimit or the Swing Line Sublimit; provided that (i) any such notice shall be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. five Business Days prior to the date of termination or reduction, (ii) any such partial reduction shall be in an aggregate amount of $5,000,000 or any whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and (iii) the Borrower shall not terminate or reduce (A) the Revolving Credit Facility if, after giving effect thereto and to any concurrent prepayments of the Revolving Credit Facility hereunder, the Total Revolving Credit Outstandings would exceed the Revolving Credit Facility, (B) the Letter of Credit Sublimit if, after giving effect thereto, the Outstanding Amount of L/C Obligations would exceed the Letter of Credit Sublimit or (C) the Swing Line Sublimit if, after giving effect thereto and to any concurrent prepayments of Swing Line Loans hereunder, the Outstanding Amount of Swing Line Loans would exceed the Swing Line Sublimit.(b)    Mandatory.  If after giving effect to any reduction or termination of Revolving Credit Commitments under this Section 2.06, the Letter of Credit Sublimit or the Swing Line Sublimit exceeds the Revolving Credit Facility at such time, the Letter of Credit Sublimit or the Swing Line Sublimit, as the case may be, shall be automatically reduced by the amount of such excess.(c)    Application of Commitment Reductions; Payment of Fees. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Lenders of any termination or reduction of the Letter of Credit Sublimit, Swing Line Sublimit or the Revolving Credit Commitments under this Section 2.06.

The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Credit Lender in accordance with its Applicable Percentage, a commitment fee in Dollars equal to the Commitment Fee Rate times the actual daily amount by which the aggregate amount of the Revolving Credit Lenders’ Revolving Credit Commitments exceeds the sum of (i) the Outstanding Amount of Revolving Credit Loans, and (ii) the Outstanding Amount of L/C Obligations, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 2.16. The commitment fee shall accrue at all times during the Availability Period, including at any time during which one or more of the conditions in Section 4.02 is not met, and shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each December, March, June and September, commencing with the first such date to occur following the Closing Date and on the last day of the Availability Period.

Such closing fee shall be in all respects fully earned, due and payable on the Closing Date and non-refundable and non-creditable thereafter.Section 2.10    Computation of Interest and Fees; Retroactive Adjustments of Applicable Rate.  (a)    All computations of interest for Base Rate Loans based on the Prime Rate shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed. All other computations of fees and interest shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed (which results in more fees or interest, as applicable, being paid than if computed on the basis of a 365-day year). Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion is paid, provided that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall, subject to Section 2.12(a), bear interest for one day. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.(b)    If, as a result of any restatement of or other adjustment to the financial statements of the Borrower or for any other reason, the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders determine that (i) the Senior Secured Leverage Ratio as calculated by the Borrower as of any applicable date was inaccurate and (ii) a proper calculation of the Senior Secured Leverage Ratio would have resulted in higher pricing for such period, the Borrower shall immediately and retroactively be obligated to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Lenders or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, promptly on demand by the Administrative Agent (or, after the occurrence of an actual or deemed entry of an order for relief with respect to the Borrower under the Bankruptcy Code of the United States, automatically and without further action by the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer), an amount equal to the excess of the amount of interest and fees that should have been paid for such period over the amount of interest and fees actually paid for such period. This paragraph shall not limit the rights of the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, under Section 2.03(c)(iii), 2.03(h) or 2.08(b) or under Article 8. The Borrower’s obligations under this Section 2.10(b) shall survive the termination of the Aggregate Commitments and the repayment of all other Obligations hereunder for 90 days after such termination and repayment.63 Section 2.11    Evidence of Debt.    (a)  The Credit Extensions made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by the Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of business. The accounts or records maintained by the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of the Credit Extensions made by the Lenders to the Borrower and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. Upon the request of any Lender made through the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative Agent) a Note, which shall evidence such Lender’s Loans in addition to such accounts or records. Each Lender may attach schedules to its Note and endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto.(b)    In addition to the accounts and records referred to in Section 2.11(a), each Revolving Credit Lender and the Administrative Agent shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice accounts or records evidencing the purchases and sales by such Revolving Credit Lender of participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by the Administrative Agent and the accounts and records of any Revolving Credit Lender in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error.Section 2.12    Payments Generally; Administrative Agent’s Clawback. (a)    General. All payments to be made by the Borrower shall be made without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrower hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the Administrative Agent’s Office in Dollars and in immediately available funds not later than 12:00 p.m. on the date specified herein.  The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Applicable Percentage (or other applicable share as provided herein) of all payments and prepayments of principal and interest due hereunder, together with all other amounts due thereto, including all fees payable with respect thereto, in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender’s Lending Office. All payments received by the Administrative Agent after 2:00 p.m. shall be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue. If any payment to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected on computing interest or fees, as the case may be.64 (b)    (i)  Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing of Eurodollar Rate Loans (or, in the case of any Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, prior to 12:00 p.m. on the date of such Borrowing) that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender’s share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with Section 2.02 (or, in the case of a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, that such Lender has made such share available in accordance with and at the time required by Section 2.02) and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing, and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans. If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender’s Loan included in such Borrowing. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.(ii)    Payments by Borrower; Presumptions by Administrative Agent. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the time at which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the L/C Issuer hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Appropriate Lenders the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Appropriate Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Appropriate Lender, in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender, the L/C Issuer or the Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this subsection (b) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.(c)    Failure to Satisfy Conditions Precedent. If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in this Article 2, and such funds are not made available to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable Credit Extension set forth in Article 4 are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall promptly return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest.65 (d)    Obligations of Lenders Several; Dollar Denominated Credit Extensions. The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Revolving Credit Loans and Incremental Term Loans, to fund participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans and to make payments pursuant to Section 10.04(c) are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan, to fund any such participation or to make any payment under Section 10.04(c) on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan, to purchase its participation or to make its payment under Section 10.04(c).  Loans and Letters of Credit shall be denominated in Dollars. (e)    Funding Source. Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner.(f)    Insufficient Funds. If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, L/C Borrowings, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, toward payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, toward payment of principal and L/C Borrowings then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and L/C Borrowings then due to such parties.Section 2.13    Sharing of Payments by Lenders.  If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of (a) Obligations in respect of any of the Facilities due and payable to such Lender hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such time in excess of its ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Obligations due and payable to such Lender at such time to (ii) the aggregate amount of the Obligations in respect of the Facilities due and payable to all Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such time) of payments on account of the Obligations in respect of the Facilities due and payable to all Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such time obtained by all the Lenders at such time or (b) Obligations in respect of any of the Facilities owing (but not due and payable) to such Lender hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such time in excess of its ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Obligations owing (but not due and payable) to such Lender at such time to (ii) the aggregate amount of the Obligations in respect of the Facilities owing (but not due and payable) to all Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such time) of payment on account of the Obligations in respect of the Facilities owing (but not due and payable) to all Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such time obtained by all of the Lenders at such time, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and subparticipations in L/C Obligations and Swing Line Loans of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of Obligations in respect of the Facilities then due and payable to the Lenders or owing (but not due and payable) to the Lenders, as the case may be, provided that:66 (i)    if any such participations or subparticipations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations or subparticipations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and(ii)    the provisions of this Section shall not be construed to apply to (A) any payment made by or on behalf of the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender), (B) the application of Cash Collateral provided for in Section 2.15, or (C) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or subparticipations in L/C Obligations or Swing Line Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this Section shall apply unless such purchase is made by the Borrower pursuant to Section 10.06(b)(vii)).The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable Law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.Section 2.14    Incremental Facilities. (a)    The Borrower may by written notice to the Administrative Agent elect to increase the existing Revolving Credit Commitments (any such increase, the “Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments”) and/or incur one or more new term loan commitments (the “Incremental Term Loan Commitments”), by an amount (1) not to exceed, in the aggregate, the greater of (x) $300,000,000 and (y) an amount such that the pro forma Senior Secured Leverage Ratio would not exceed 2.50:1.00 as of the Increased Amount Date and (2) not less than, individually, $25,000,000.(b)    Each such notice shall specify (i) the date (each, an “Increased Amount Date”) on which the Borrower proposes that the Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments or Incremental Term Loan Commitments, as applicable, shall be effective, which shall be a date not less than 10 Business Days after the date on which such notice is delivered to the Administrative Agent (or such shorter period of time as may be agreed to by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion); and (ii) the identity of each Lender or other Person, which must be an Eligible Assignee (each, an “Incremental Revolving Loan Lender” or “Incremental Term Loan Lender,” as applicable) to whom the Borrower proposes any portion of such Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments or Incremental Term Loan Commitments, as applicable, be allocated and the amounts of such allocations. Any Lender approached to provide all or a portion of the Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments or Incremental Term Loan Commitments, as applicable, may elect or decline, in its sole discretion, to provide an Incremental Revolving Credit Commitment or Incremental Term Loan Commitment.  Any Incremental Term Loans made on an Increased Amount Date shall be designated a separate series (a “Series”) of Incremental Term Loans for all purposes of this Agreement or, if made on terms identical to any existing Series of Incremental Term Loans, may constitute a part of such Series of Incremental Term Loans.67 (c)    The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders promptly upon receipt of the Borrower’s notice of each Increased Amount Date and in respect thereof (i) the Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments and the Incremental Revolving Loan Lenders or the Series of Incremental Term Loan Commitments and the Incremental Term Loan Lenders of such Series, as applicable and (ii) in the case of each notice to any applicable Revolving Credit Lender, the respective interests in such Revolving Credit Lender’s Revolving Credit Loans, in each case subject to the assignments contemplated by this Section.(d)    Such Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments or Incremental Term Loan Commitments shall become effective as of such Increased Amount Date; provided that:(i)    (x) no Default or Event of Default shall exist on such Increased Amount Date before or after giving effect to such Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments or Incremental Term Loan Commitments, as applicable and the extensions of credit to be made thereunder on such date and (y) the representations and warranties of the Borrower and each other Loan Party contained in Article V hereof shall be true and correct in all material respects (except that any representation and warranty that is qualified as to “materiality,” “Material Adverse Effect” or similar language shall be true and correct (after giving effect to any qualification therein) on and as of such date, except in each case to the extent that such representations and warranties specifically refer to an earlier date, in which case they shall be true and correct as of such earlier date); provided that, in the case of Incremental Term Loans incurred to finance a Permitted Acquisition, this clause (i) shall be limited to the representations and warranties of the Borrower and each other Loan Party set forth in Sections 5.01(a), 5.01(b), 5.02(a), 5.02(b)(i), 5.02(c), 5.14, 5.19, 5.20, 5.21, 5.22 and 5.23;(ii)    the Borrower shall be in pro forma compliance with each of the covenants set forth in Section 7.11 as of the last day of the most recently completed Measurement Period and as of the Increased Amount Date; (iii)    the Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments or Incremental Term Loan Commitments, as applicable, shall be effected pursuant to one or more Joinder Agreements executed and delivered by the Borrower, the Incremental Revolving Loan Lender(s) or Incremental Term Loan Lender(s), as applicable, and the Administrative Agent, each of which shall be recorded in the Register (and each Incremental Revolving Loan Lender and Incremental Term Loan Lender shall be subject to the requirements set forth in Section 3.01); (iv)    the Incremental Facilities shall rank pari passu in right of security with the Revolving Credit Facility; (v)    all reasonable fees and out-of-pocket expenses owing to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders (other than a Defaulting Lender) in respect of the Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments and Incremental Term Loan Commitments shall have been paid; and 68 (vi)    the Borrower shall deliver or cause to be delivered legal opinions, officer’s certificates and such other documents (including, if applicable, the Mortgages and related documents required pursuant to Section 6.11(b) or modifications of any Mortgages and title insurance endorsements or policies) reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent in connection with any such transaction.(e)    On any Increased Amount Date on which Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments are effected, subject to the satisfaction of the foregoing terms and conditions, (i) each of the existing Revolving Credit Lenders shall assign to each of the Incremental Revolving Loan Lenders, and each of the Incremental Revolving Loan Lenders shall purchase from each of the existing Revolving Credit Lenders, at the principal amount thereof (together with accrued interest), such interests in the Revolving Credit Loans outstanding on such Increased Amount Date as shall be necessary in order that, after giving effect to all such assignments and purchases, such Revolving Credit Loans will be held by existing Revolving Credit Lenders and Incremental Revolving Loan Lenders ratably in accordance with their Revolving Credit Commitments after giving effect to the addition of such Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments to the Revolving Credit Commitments, (ii) each Incremental Revolving Credit Commitment shall be deemed for all purposes a Revolving Credit Commitment and each Loan made thereunder (an “Incremental Revolving Loan”) shall be deemed, for all purposes, a Revolving Credit Loan and (iii) each Incremental Revolving Loan Lender shall become a Lender with respect to the Incremental Revolving Credit Commitment and all matters relating thereto. (f)    On any Increased Amount Date on which any Incremental Term Loan Commitments of any Series are effective, subject to the satisfaction of the foregoing terms and conditions, (i) each Incremental Term Loan Lender of such Series shall make a Loan to the Borrower (an “Incremental Term Loan”) in an amount equal to its Incremental Term Loan Commitment of such Series and (ii) each Incremental Term Loan Lender of such Series shall become a Lender hereunder with respect to the Incremental Term Loan Commitment of such Series and the Incremental Term Loans of such Series made pursuant thereto.(g)    The terms, provisions and documentation of the Incremental Term Loans and Incremental Term Loan Commitments of any Series shall be, (i) except as otherwise set forth herein, as agreed in the Joinder Agreement between the Borrower, the applicable Incremental Term Loan Lenders providing such Incremental Term Loan Commitments and the Administrative Agent and (ii) subject to the limitations in clauses (A) and (B) below, not more restrictive taken as a whole to the Borrower and the other Loan Parties than those applicable to (1) any other Facility at the time of incurrence of such Incremental Term Loan Facility, unless such other terms apply only after the latest Maturity Date of each other Facility at the time of incurrence of such Incremental Term Loans or (2) the Revolving Credit Facility unless, in each case, such other terms relate only to mandatory prepayments, amortization, pricing or fees.  In any event, (A) the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of all Incremental Term Loans of any Series shall be no shorter than 36 months and (B) the applicable Incremental Term Loan Maturity Date of each Series shall be no shorter than the latest final maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility at the time of incurrence of such Incremental Term Loans.69 (h)    The terms and provisions of the Incremental Revolving Loans shall be identical to the Revolving Loans; provided that if the Incremental Revolving Loan Lenders require an interest rate in excess of the interest rate then applicable to the Revolving Facility, the interest rate on the Revolving Facility shall be increased to equal such required rate without further consent of the affected Lenders. (i)    Each Joinder Agreement may, without the consent of any other Lenders, effect such amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the opinion of the Administrative Agent, to effect the provisions of this Section 2.14. (j)    This Section 2.14 shall supersede any provisions in Section 2.13 or Section 10.01 to the contrary.Section 2.15    Cash Collateral. (a)    Certain Credit Support Events. Upon the request of the Administrative Agent or the L/C Issuer (i) if the L/C Issuer has honored any full or partial drawing request under any Letter of Credit and such drawing has resulted in an L/C Borrowing or (ii) if, as of the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, any L/C Obligation for any reason remains outstanding, the Borrower shall, in each case, immediately Cash Collateralize all L/C Obligations in an amount equal to 105% of the then Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations. At any time that there shall exist a Defaulting Lender, immediately upon the request of the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or the Swing Line Lender, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to cover all Fronting Exposure (after giving effect to Section 2.16(a)(iv) and any Cash Collateral provided by the Defaulting Lender).(b)    Grant of Security Interest. All Cash Collateral (other than credit support not constituting funds subject to deposit) shall be maintained in blocked, non-interest bearing deposit accounts at a bank selected by the Borrower and reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent.  The Borrower, and to the extent provided by any Lender, such Lender, hereby grants to (and subjects to the control of) the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and the Lenders (including the Swing Line Lender), and agrees to maintain, a first priority security interest in all such cash, deposit accounts and all balances therein, and all other property so provided as Cash Collateral pursuant hereto, and in all proceeds of the foregoing, all as security for the obligations to which such Cash Collateral may be applied pursuant to Section 2.15(c). If at any time the Administrative Agent determines that Cash Collateral is subject to any right or claim of any Person other than the Administrative Agent as herein provided, or that the total amount of such Cash Collateral is less than the applicable Fronting Exposure and other obligations secured thereby, the Borrower or the relevant Defaulting Lender will, promptly upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay or provide to the Administrative Agent additional Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to eliminate such deficiency.(c)    Application. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Cash Collateral provided under any of this Section 2.15 or Sections 2.03, 2.04, 2.05, 2.16 or Section 8.02 in respect of Letters of Credit or Swing Line Loans shall be held and applied to the satisfaction of the specific L/C Obligations, Swing Line Loans, obligations to fund participations therein (including, as to Cash Collateral provided by a Defaulting Lender, any interest accrued on such obligation) and other obligations for which the Cash Collateral was so provided, prior to any other application of such property as may be provided for herein. 70 (d)    Release. Cash Collateral (or the appropriate portion thereof) provided to reduce Fronting Exposure or other obligations shall be released promptly following (i) the elimination of the applicable Fronting Exposure or other obligations giving rise thereto (including by the termination of Defaulting Lender status of the applicable Lender (or, as appropriate, its assignee following compliance with Section 10.06(b)(viii))) or (ii) the Administrative Agent’s good faith determination that there exists excess Cash Collateral; provided that (x) Cash Collateral furnished by or on behalf of a Loan Party shall not be released during the continuance of an Event of Default (and following application as provided in this Section 2.15 may be otherwise applied in accordance with Section 8.03), and (y) the Person providing Cash Collateral and the L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender, as applicable, may agree that Cash Collateral shall not be released but instead held to support future anticipated Fronting Exposure or other obligations.Section 2.16    Defaulting Lenders. (a)    Adjustments. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as that Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable Law:(i)    Waivers and Amendments. That Defaulting Lender’s right to approve or disapprove any amendment, modification, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in the definitions of Required Lenders, Required Revolving Credit Lenders and Required Incremental Term Loan Lenders and, in addition, Defaulting Lenders shall not be permitted to vote with respect to any other amendment, modification, waiver or consent pursuant to Section 10.01 or otherwise direct the Administrative Agent pursuant to the terms hereof or of the other Loan Documents; provided that any amendment, modification, waiver or consent requiring the consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender which affects such Defaulting Lender differently than other affected Lenders shall require the consent of such Defaulting Lender.(ii)    Reallocation of Payments. Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of that Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Article 8 or otherwise, and including any amounts made available to the Administrative Agent by that Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 10.08), shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by that Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder; second, to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by that Defaulting Lender to the L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender hereunder; third, if so determined by the Administrative Agent or requested by the L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender, to be held as Cash Collateral for future funding obligations of that Defaulting Lender of any participation in any Swing Line Loan or Letter of Credit; fourth, as the Borrower may request (so long as no Default or Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which that Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent; fifth, if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to be held in a non-interest bearing deposit account and released in order to satisfy obligations of that Defaulting Lender to fund Loans under this Agreement; sixth, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders, the L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender, the L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender against that Defaulting Lender as a result of that Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; seventh, so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against that Defaulting Lender as a result of that Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and eighth, to that Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans or L/C Borrowings in respect of which that Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share and (y) such Loans or L/C Borrowings were made at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of, and L/C Borrowings owed to, all non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of, or L/C Borrowings owed to, that Defaulting Lender. Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section 2.16(a)(ii) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by that Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto. 71 (iii)    Certain Fees. That Defaulting Lender (x) shall not be entitled to receive a commitment fee pursuant to Section 2.09(a) for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and the Borrower shall not be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender) and (y) shall be limited in its right to receive Letter of Credit Fees as provided in Section 2.03(h).(iv)    Reallocation of Applicable Percentages to Reduce Fronting Exposure. During any period in which there is a Defaulting Lender in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility, for purposes of computing the amount of the obligation of each Revolving Credit Lender that is not a Defaulting Lender to acquire, refinance or fund participations in Letters of Credit or Swing Line Loans pursuant to Sections 2.03 and 2.04, the “Applicable Percentage” of each Revolving Credit Lender that is not a Defaulting Lender in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility shall be computed without giving effect to the Revolving Credit Commitment of that Defaulting Lender; provided that (i) each such reallocation shall be given effect only if, at the date the applicable Revolving Credit Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, no Default or Event of Default exists; and (ii) the aggregate obligation of each Revolving Credit Lender that is not a Defaulting Lender to acquire, refinance or fund participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans shall not exceed the positive difference, if any, of (x) the Revolving Credit Commitment of that Revolving Credit Lender that is not a Defaulting Lender minus (y) the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Revolving Credit Loans of such Revolving Credit Lender plus such Revolving Credit Lender’s Applicable Percentage of the Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations plus such Revolving Credit Lender’s Applicable Percentage of all Swing Line Loans.72 (b)    Defaulting Lender Cure. If the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Swing Line Lender and the L/C Issuer agree in writing in their sole discretion that a Defaulting Lender should no longer be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any Cash Collateral), that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders (and shall pay to such other Lenders any break funding costs that such other Lenders may incur as a result of such purchase) or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans to be held on a pro rata basis by the Revolving Credit Lenders in accordance with their Applicable Percentages of the Revolving Credit Facility (without giving effect to Section 2.16(a)(iv)), whereupon that Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Revolving Credit Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Revolving Credit Lender’s having been a Defaulting Lender.ARTICLE 3.TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITYSection 3.01    Taxes. (a)    Payments Free of Taxes; Obligation to Withhold; Payments on Account of Taxes.  (i)         Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall to the extent permitted by applicable Laws be made free and clear of and without reduction or withholding for any Taxes. If, however, applicable Laws require the Loan Party or the Administrative Agent to withhold or deduct any Tax, such Tax shall be withheld or deducted in accordance with such Laws as determined by the Loan Party or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, upon the basis of the information and documentation to be delivered pursuant to subsection (e) below.(ii)    If the Loan Party or the Administrative Agent shall be required to withhold or deduct any Taxes, including both United States Federal backup withholding and withholding taxes, from any payment, then (A) the Administrative Agent shall withhold or make such deductions as are determined by the Administrative Agent to be required based upon the information and documentation it has received pursuant to subsection (e) below, (B) the Administrative Agent shall timely pay the full amount withheld or deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority, and (C) to the extent that the withholding or deduction is made on account of Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after any required withholding or the making of all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent, Lender or L/C Issuer, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such withholding or deduction been made.73 (b)    Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower. Without limiting the provisions of subsection (a) above, the Loan Parties shall timely pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Laws, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of Other Taxes.(c)    Tax Indemnifications.  (i)    Without limiting the provisions of subsection (a) or (b) above, the Loan Parties shall, and do hereby, jointly and severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender and the L/C Issuer, and shall make payment in respect thereof within ten days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) withheld or deducted by the Loan Party or the Administrative Agent or paid by the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, and any reasonable out of pocket expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. The Borrower shall also, and does hereby, indemnify the Administrative Agent, and shall make payment in respect thereof within ten days after demand therefor, for any amount which a Lender or the L/C Issuer for any reason fails to pay indefeasibly to the Administrative Agent as required by clause (ii) of this subsection. A certificate as to the amount of any such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or the L/C Issuer (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or the L/C Issuer, shall be conclusive absent manifest error (so long as such certificate is prepared in a commercially reasonable manner in accordance with applicable Law).(ii)    Without limiting the provisions of subsection (a) or (b) above, each Lender and the L/C Issuer shall, and does hereby, severally indemnify:(A)        the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, and shall make payment in respect thereof within ten days after demand therefor, against any and all Taxes and any and all related losses, claims, liabilities, penalties, interest and expenses (including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for the Borrower or the Administrative Agent) incurred by or asserted against the Borrower or the Administrative Agent by any Governmental Authority as a result of the failure by such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, to deliver, or as a result of the inaccuracy or similar deficiency of, any documentation required to be delivered by such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, to the Borrower or the Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection (e)(ii); and 74 (B)    the Administrative Agent, and shall make payment in respect thereof within ten days after demand therefor, against (x) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Loan Parties to do so), (y) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority and (z) any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s or L/C Issuer’s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 10.06(d) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register. Each Lender and the L/C Issuer hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, under this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this clause (ii). The agreements in this clause (ii) shall survive the resignation and/or replacement of the Administrative Agent, any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender or the L/C Issuer, the termination of the Aggregate Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other Obligations.(d)    Evidence of Payments. Upon request by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, after any payment of Taxes by the Borrower or by the Administrative Agent to a Governmental Authority as provided in this Section 3.01, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent or the Administrative Agent shall deliver to the Borrower, as the case may be, the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of any return required by Laws to report such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be.(e)    Status of Lenders; Tax Documentation.  (i)    For purposes of this Section 3.01(e), the term “Lender” includes any L/C Issuer. Each Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and to the Administrative Agent, at the time or times prescribed by applicable Laws or when reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable Laws or by the taxing authorities of any jurisdiction and such other reasonably requested information as will permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, to determine (A) whether or not payments made hereunder or under any other Loan Document are subject to Taxes, (B) if applicable, the required rate of withholding or deduction, and (C) such Lender’s entitlement to any available exemption from, or reduction of, applicable Taxes in respect of all payments to be made to such Lender by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise to establish such Lender’s status for withholding tax purposes in the applicable jurisdiction. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding sentence, the delivery, completion and execution of documentation and other requested information described in this subsection (e)(i) (and not, for the avoidance of doubt, otherwise described in subsection(e)(ii)) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such delivery, completion or execution would subject the Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.75 (ii)    Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, on or prior to the date on which a Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), but only to the extent it is legally entitled to do so,(A)    any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent executed originals of IRS Form W-9 or such other documentation or information prescribed by applicable Laws or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements; and(B)    each Foreign Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be reasonably requested by the recipient), whichever of the following is applicable:(1)    in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “interest” article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “business profits” or “other income” article of such tax treaty,(2)    executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI,(3)    in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not (A) a “bank” within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (B) a “10 percent shareholder” of the Borrower within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or (C) a “controlled foreign corporation” described in section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a “U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate”) and (y) executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN, or76 (4)    to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed originals of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-2 or H-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner together with the executed originals of the applicable IRS Forms.(iii)    If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.  Solely for purposes of this clause (iii), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.(iv)    Each Lender shall promptly (A) notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of any change in circumstances which would modify or render invalid any claimed exemption or reduction or if any form or certification it previously delivered becomes obsolete or inaccurate or expires and (B) update any such form or certification or notify the Borrower and Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.(f)    Treatment of Certain Refunds. At no time shall the Administrative Agent have any obligation to file for or otherwise pursue on behalf of a Lender or the L/C Issuer, or have any obligation to pay to any Lender or the L/C Issuer, any refund of Taxes withheld or deducted from funds paid for the account of such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be. If the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer determines, in its sole discretion exercised reasonably, that it has received a refund of any Indemnified Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section, it shall pay to the Borrower an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section with respect to the Indemnified Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, related to the receipt of such refund and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund), provided that the Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer in the event the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This subsection shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this subsection, in no event will the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer be required to pay any amount to the Borrower pursuant to this subsection the payment of which would place the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer in a less favorable after-Tax position than the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer would have been in if the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid.77 Section 3.02    Illegality.  If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to the Eurodollar Rate, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, (i) any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Eurodollar Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies or to convert Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended and (ii) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or maintaining Base Rate Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate, the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate, in each case until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, (x) the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all Eurodollar Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans or (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or maintaining Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate), the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate, in each case, either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted. Section 3.03    Inability to Determine Rates. If the Required Lenders determine that for any reason in connection with any request for a Eurodollar Rate Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof that (a) deposits are not being offered to banks in the London interbank Eurodollar market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Eurodollar Rate Loan, (b) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan or in connection with an existing or proposed Base Rate Loan or (c) the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, (x) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended and (y) in the event of a determination described in the preceding sentence with respect to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate, the utilization of the Eurodollar Rate component in determining the Base Rate shall be suspended, in each case until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.78 Section 3.04    Increased Costs; Reserves on Eurodollar Rate Loans. (a)    Increased Costs Generally. If any Change in Law shall:(i)    impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement contemplated by Section 3.04(e)) or the L/C Issuer;(ii)    subject the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer to any Tax (except for Indemnified Taxes covered by Section 3.01 and the imposition of, or any change in the rate of, any Tax described in clause (a)(ii) or clause (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Tax) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitment, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; or(iii)    impose on any Lender or the L/C Issuer or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Rate Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein; and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or any Lender of making, continuing or maintaining any Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan), or to increase the cost to such Lender or the L/C Issuer of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of Credit), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer, the Borrower will pay to the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered; provided, that the Borrower shall not be obligated to pay any such compensation unless the Lender or L/C Issuer requesting such compensation also is requesting compensation as a result of such Change in Law from other similarly situated customers under agreements relating to similar credit transactions that include provisions similar to this Section 3.04(a).79 (b)    Capital Requirements. If any Lender or the L/C Issuer determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or the L/C Issuer or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender’s or the L/C Issuer’s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s or the L/C Issuer’s capital or on the capital of such Lender’s or the L/C Issuer’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the L/C Issuer, to a level below that which such Lender or the L/C Issuer or such Lender’s or the L/C Issuer’s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s or the L/C Issuer’s policies and the policies of such Lender’s or the L/C Issuer’s holding company with respect to capital adequacy and liquidity), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer or such Lender’s or the L/C Issuer’s holding company for any such reduction suffered; provided, that the Borrower shall not be obligated to pay any such compensation unless the Lender or L/C Issuer requesting such compensation also is requesting compensation as a result of such Change in Law from other similarly situated customers under agreements relating to similar credit transactions that include provisions similar to this Section 3.04(b).(c)    Certificates for Reimbursement. A certificate of a Lender or the L/C Issuer setting forth in reasonable detail the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) of this Section and delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within ten days after receipt thereof.(d)    Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the L/C Issuer to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s or the L/C Issuer’s right to demand such compensation, provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or the L/C Issuer pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than six months prior to the date that such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender’s or the L/C Issuer’s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the six-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).(e)    Reserves on Eurodollar Rate Loans. The Borrower shall pay to each Lender, as long as such Lender shall be required to maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including Eurodollar funds or deposits (currently known as “Eurodollar liabilities”), additional interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Eurodollar Rate Loan equal to the actual costs of such reserves allocated to such Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive and binding), which shall be due and payable on each date on which interest is payable on such Loan, provided the Borrower shall have received at least ten days’ prior notice (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of such additional interest from such Lender; provided, that the Borrower shall not be obligated to pay any such additional interest unless the Lender requesting such additional interest also is requesting additional interest from other similarly situated customers under agreements relating to similar credit transactions that include provisions similar to this Section 3.04(e). If a Lender fails to give notice ten days prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date, such additional interest shall be due and payable ten days from receipt of such notice.80 Section 3.05    Compensation for Losses. Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of:(a)    any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise);(b)    any failure by the Borrower to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower (in the case of a borrowing, for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan); or(c)    any assignment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.14(b) or Section 10.13;including any foreign exchange losses or loss of anticipated profits and any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained or from the performance of any foreign exchange contract. The Borrower shall also pay any customary and reasonable administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing. For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under this Section 3.05, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Eurodollar Rate Loan made by it at the Eurodollar Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the London or other offshore interbank market for Dollars for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Eurodollar Rate Loan was in fact so funded. A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender, as specified in this Section, delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error.Section 3.06    Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.    (a)  Designation of a Different Lending Office. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.04, or the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender, the L/C Issuer, or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender or the L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 3.01, or if any Lender gives a notice pursuant to Section 3.02, then such Lender or the L/C Issuer shall, as applicable, use reasonable efforts to designate a different Lending Office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender or the L/C Issuer, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.01 or 3.04, as the case may be, in the future, or eliminate the need for the notice pursuant to Section 3.02, as applicable, and (ii) in each case, would not subject such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender or the L/C Issuer in connection with any such designation or assignment.81 (b)    Replacement of Lenders.

In this connection, the Administrative Agent, as “collateral agent” and any co-agents, sub-agents and attorneys-in-fact appointed by the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 9.05 for purposes of holding or enforcing any Lien on the Collateral (or any portion thereof) granted under the Collateral Documents, or for exercising any rights and remedies thereunder (at the direction of the Administrative Agent), shall be entitled to the benefits of all provisions of this Article 9 and Article 10 (including Section 10.04(c)), as though such co-agents, sub-agents and attorneys-in-fact were the “collateral agent” under the Loan Documents, as if set forth in full herein with respect thereto; provided that to the extent the L/C Issuer is entitled to indemnification under this Section 9.01 solely in connection with its role as the L/C Issuer, only the Revolving Credit Lenders shall be required to indemnify the L/C Issuer in accordance with this Section 9.01.123 Section 9.02    Rights as a Lender. Any Agent shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not an Agent hereunder, and the term “Lender” or “Lenders” shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as such Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not an Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.Section 9.03    Exculpatory Provisions. No Agent shall have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Agents:(a)    shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing;(b)    shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except (in the case of the Administrative Agent) discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents); provided that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent to liability that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable Law, including for the avoidance of doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any Debtor Relief Law or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any Debtor Relief Law; and(c)    shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as such Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Sections 10.01 and Section 8.02) or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until it shall have received written notice from a Lender, an L/C Issuer or the Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such Default and stating that such notice is a “notice of default.”124 No Agent or any of its Related Parties shall be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or the creation, perfection or priority of any Lien purported to be created by the Collateral Documents, (v) the value or the sufficiency of any Collateral or (vi) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article 4 or elsewhere herein, other than, in the case of the Administrative Agent, to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.Section 9.04    Reliance. Each Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. Each Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, or the issuance of a Letter of Credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or the L/C Issuer, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender or the L/C Issuer unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender or the L/C Issuer prior to the making of such Loan or the issuance of such Letter of Credit. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.Section 9.05    Delegation of Duties. The Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any sub-agents except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and nonappealable judgment that the Administrative Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such sub agents.125 Section 9.06    Resignation of Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders, the L/C Issuer and the Borrower. Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the Borrower, to appoint a successor, which shall be a financial institution with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such financial institution with an office in the United States. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may on behalf of the Lenders and the L/C Issuer appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above; provided that if the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that no qualifying Person has accepted such appointment, then such resignation shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice and (a) the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (except that in the case of any collateral security held by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders or the L/C Issuer under any of the Loan Documents, the retiring Administrative Agent shall continue to hold such collateral security until such time as a successor Administrative Agent is appointed) and (b) all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender and the L/C Issuer directly, until such time as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided for above in this Section. Upon the acceptance of a successor’s appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or retired) Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this Section). The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After the retiring Administrative Agent’s resignation hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article and Section 10.04 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring Administrative Agent was acting as Administrative Agent.Any resignation by the entity serving as Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section shall also constitute its resignation as the L/C Issuer and Swing Line Lender, if applicable.  Upon the acceptance of a successor’s appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor may agree to succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring L/C Issuer and Swing Line Lender, if applicable.  In connection with any such agreement to succeed to the retiring L/C Issuer the successor L/C Issuer, if applicable, shall issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession or make other arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the retiring L/C Issuer to effectively assume the obligations of the retiring L/C Issuer with respect to such Letters of Credit.126 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the failure of any successor to agree to succeed to the retiring L/C Issuer and/or Swing Line Lender, shall not affect the resignation of the retiring L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender, as the case may be.  The retiring L/C Issuer shall retain all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the L/C Issuer hereunder with respect to all Letters of Credit outstanding as of the effective date of its resignation as L/C Issuer and all L/C Obligations with respect thereto (including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Loans or fund risk participations in Unreimbursed Amounts pursuant to Section 2.03(c)) but shall have no obligation to issue additional Letters of Credit or to amend, extend or otherwise modify any existing Letters of Credit.  The retiring Swing Line Lender shall retain all the rights of the Swing Line Lender provided for hereunder with respect to Swing Line Loans made by it and outstanding as of the effective date of such resignation, including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Loans or fund risk participations in outstanding Swing Line Loans pursuant to Section 2.04(c) but shall have no obligation to make any additional Swing Line Loans. Section 9.07    Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Lenders. Each Lender and the L/C Issuer acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender and the L/C Issuer also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.Section 9.08    No Other Duties, Etc. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none of the Arrangers or the Agents shall have any powers, duties or responsibilities under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, except in its capacity, as applicable, as the Administrative Agent, a Lender or the L/C Issuer hereunder.Section 9.09    Administrative Agent May File Proofs of Claim. In case of the pendency of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or any other judicial proceeding relating to any Loan Party, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan or L/C Obligation shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered (but not obligated), by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise:(a)    to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans, L/C Obligations and all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders, the L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders, the L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders, the L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.03(h) and (i), 2.09 and 10.04) allowed in such judicial proceeding; and(b)    to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;127 and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender and the L/C Issuer to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders and the L/C Issuer, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.09 and 10.04.Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender or the L/C Issuer any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Lender or the L/C Issuer to authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender or the L/C Issuer in any such proceeding.Section 9.10    Collateral and Guaranty Matters. Each Lender (including in its capacities as a potential Cash Management Bank and as a potential Hedge Bank) and the L/C Issuer irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent, at its option and in its discretion:(a)    to release any Lien to the extent securing the Obligations on any property granted to or held by the Administrative Agent under any Loan Document (i) upon termination of the Aggregate Commitments and payment in full of all Obligations (other than (A) contingent indemnification obligations as to which no claim has been asserted and (B) obligations and liabilities under Secured Cash Management Agreements and Secured Hedge Agreements), the expiration or termination of all Letters of Credit (other than Letters of Credit which have been Cash Collateralized or as to which other arrangements satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer shall have been made) and the termination and payment in full of all obligations and liabilities under Secured Cash Management Agreements and Secured Hedge Agreements in respect of which the Administrative Agent has received notice pursuant to Section 9.11 (other than any such agreements as to which other arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the applicable Cash Management Bank or Hedge Bank have been made), (ii) that is sold as part of or in connection with any sale permitted hereunder or that constitutes a disposition of Receivables Program Assets permitted pursuant to Section 7.05(l) or (iii) if approved, authorized or ratified in writing in accordance with Section 10.01; (b)    to release any Guarantor from its Guarantee of the Obligations under the Collateral Agreement (i) upon termination of the Aggregate Commitments and payment in full of all Obligations (other than (A) contingent indemnification obligations as to which no claim has been asserted and (B) obligations and liabilities under Secured Cash Management Agreement and Secured Hedge Agreements), the expiration or termination of all Letters of Credit (other than Letters of Credit which have been Cash Collateralized or as to which other arrangements satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer shall have been made) and the termination and payment in full of all obligations and liabilities under Secured Cash Management Agreements and Secured Hedge Agreements in respect of which the Administrative Agent has received notice pursuant to Section 9.11 (other than any such agreements as to which other arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the applicable Cash Management Bank or Hedge Bank have been made) or (ii) if approved, authorized or ratified in writing in accordance with Section 10.01;128 (c)    to release any Guarantor from its Guarantee of the Obligations and all Liens granted by any such Guarantor, and all pledges of Equity Interests in any such Guarantor (provided, if such Guarantor becomes an Excluded Subsidiary then such release shall be limited to 35% of such voting Equity Interests) under the Collateral Agreement if such Person ceases to be a Subsidiary (or becomes an Immaterial Subsidiary or an Excluded Subsidiary) as a result of a transaction permitted hereunder (unless such Person continues to guarantee the 2022 Senior Notes or the 2021 Senior Notes); and (d)    to subordinate any Lien on any property granted to or held by the Administrative Agent under any Loan Document, to the extent securing the Obligations, to the holder of any Lien on such property that is permitted by Section 7.01(i).Upon request by the Administrative Agent at any time, the Required Lenders will confirm in writing the Administrative Agent’s authority to release or subordinate its interest in particular types or items of Collateral, or to release any Guarantor from its Guarantee of the Obligations under the Collateral Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.10. In each case as specified in this Section 9.10, the Administrative Agent will, at the Borrower’s expense, execute and deliver to the applicable Loan Party such documents as such Loan Party may reasonably request to evidence the release of such item of Collateral from the assignment and security interest granted under the Collateral Documents or to subordinate its interest in such item, or to release such Guarantor from its Guarantee of the Obligations under the Collateral Agreement, in each case in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents and this Section 9.10.Section 9.11    Secured Cash Management Agreements and Secured Hedge Agreements. No Cash Management Bank or Hedge Bank that obtains the benefits of the Collateral Agreement or any Collateral by virtue of the provisions hereof or of the Collateral Agreement or any Collateral Document shall have any right to notice of any action or to consent to, direct or object to any action hereunder or under any other Loan Document or otherwise in respect of the Collateral (including the release or impairment of any Collateral) other than in its capacity as a Lender and, in such case, only to the extent expressly provided in the Loan Documents. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article 9 to the contrary, the Administrative Agent shall not be required to verify the payment of, or that other satisfactory arrangements have been made with respect to, Obligations arising under Secured Cash Management Agreements and Secured Hedge Agreements unless the Administrative Agent has received written notice of such Obligations, together with such supporting documentation as the Administrative Agent may request, from the applicable Cash Management Bank or Hedge Bank, as the case may be.ARTICLE 10.MISCELLANEOUSSection 10.01    Amendments, Etc. No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, and no consent to any departure by the Borrower or any other Loan Party therefrom, shall be effective unless in writing signed by the Required Lenders and the Borrower or the applicable Loan Party, as the case may be, and acknowledged by the Administrative Agent (or signed by the Administrative Agent on behalf of and with the written consent of the Required Lenders), and each such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given;

It is understood that posting such amendment or Schedule 7.02(r)(i) Update, as applicable, electronically on IntraLinks/IntraAgency or another relevant website with notice of such posting by the Administrative Agent to the Required Lenders shall be deemed adequate receipt of notice thereof.Section 10.02    Notices; Effectiveness; Electronic Communication.

The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer, each Lender and the Related Parties of each of them from all losses, costs, expenses and liabilities resulting from the reliance by such Person on each notice purportedly given by or on behalf of the Borrower except to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Person.  All telephonic communications with the Administrative Agent may be recorded by the Administrative Agent, and each of the parties hereby consents to such recording.Section 10.03    No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies; Enforcement.

The obligations of the Lenders under this subsection (c) are subject to the provisions of Section 2.12(d).(d)    Waiver of Consequential Damages, Etc. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower shall not assert, and hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof.

The agreements in this Section 10.04 shall survive the resignation of the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and the Swing Line Lender, the replacement of any Lender, the termination of the Aggregate Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all the other Obligations.Section 10.05    Payments Set Aside. To the extent that any payment by or on behalf of the Borrower is made to the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or any Lender, or the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or any Lender exercises its right of setoff, and such payment or the proceeds of such setoff or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or such Lender in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or otherwise, then (a) to the extent of such recovery, the obligation or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such setoff had not occurred and (b) each Lender and the L/C Issuer severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent upon demand its applicable share (without duplication) of any amount so recovered from or repaid by the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such payment is made at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Effective Rate from time to time in effect.

Each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Loans or the Commitment assigned, except that this clause (ii) shall not (A) apply to the Swing Line Lender’s rights and obligations in respect of Swing Line Loans or (B) prohibit any Lender from assigning all or a portion of its rights and obligations among separate Facilities on a non-pro rata basis.137 (iii)    Required Consents. No consent shall be required for any assignment except to the extent required by subsection (b)(i)(B) of this Section and, in addition:(A)        the consent of the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required unless (1) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of such assignment or (2) such assignment is to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund; provided that the Borrower shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment unless it shall object thereto by written notice to the Administrative Agent within five Business Days after having received notice thereof in the case of assignments of any Incremental Term Loans and ten Business Days after having received notice thereof in the case of assignments of the Revolving Credit Facility; (B)    the consent of the Administrative Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required for assignments in respect of (1) any Incremental Term Loan Commitment or any Revolving Credit Commitment if such assignment is to a Person that is not a Lender with a Commitment in respect of the applicable Facility, an Affiliate of such Lender or an Approved Fund with respect to such Lender or (2) any Incremental Term Loan to a Person that is not a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund; and(C)    the consent of the L/C Issuer and the Swing Line Lender (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required for any assignment in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility.(iv)    Assignment and Assumption. The parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee in the amount of $3,500; provided, however, that the Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, elect to waive such processing and recordation fee in the case of any assignment. The assignee, if it is not a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire.(v)    No Assignment to Certain Persons. No such assignment shall be made (A) to the Borrower or any of the Borrower’s Affiliates or Subsidiaries, except as provided below in clause (vii) or (B) to a Defaulting Lender or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Person who, upon becoming a Lender hereunder, would constitute any of the foregoing Persons described in this clause (B).(vi)    No Assignment to Natural Persons.

In connection with any Incremental Term Loans repurchased and cancelled pursuant to this Section 10.06, the Administrative Agent is authorized to make appropriate entries in the Register to reflect any such cancellation.139 (viii)    Certain Additional Payments. In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments to the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with the consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Loans previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon) and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro rata share of all Loans and participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans in accordance with its Applicable Percentage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under applicable Law without compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs.Subject to acceptance and recording in the Register thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection (c) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.01, 3.04, 3.05, and 10.04 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment. Upon request, the Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and deliver a Note to the assignee Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this subsection shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with subsection (d) of this Section.(c)    Register. The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower (and such agency being solely for tax purposes), shall maintain at the Administrative Agent’s Office a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts of the Loans and L/C Obligations owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the “Register”).  Upon its receipt of a duly completed and executed Assignment and Assumption, the Administrative Agent shall record the information contained therein in the Register.  The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. In addition, the Administrative Agent shall maintain on the Register information regarding the designation, and revocation of designation, of any Lender as a Defaulting Lender. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and any Lender (with respect to such Lender’s entry), at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.140 (d)    Participations. Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural person, a Defaulting Lender or the Borrower or any of the Borrower’s Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a “Participant”) in all or a portion of such Lender’s rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or Loans (including such Lender’s participations in L/C Obligations and/or Swing Line Loans) owing to it); provided that (A) such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (C) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuer shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement; provided, further, that any bank that is a Farm Credit Lender that (a) has purchased a participation from any Lender that is a Farm Credit Lender in the minimum amount of $5,000,000 on or after the Closing Date, (b) is, by written notice to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (a “Voting Participant Notification”), designated by such Lender as being entitled to be accorded the rights of a voting participant hereunder (any such bank so designated, a “Voting Participant”) and (c) receives the prior written consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to become a Voting Participant (such consent to be required only to the extent and under the circumstances it would be required if such Voting Participant were to become a Lender pursuant to an assignment in accordance with Section 10.06(b)(iii)), shall be entitled to vote (and the voting rights of such Lender from whom it purchased such participation shall be correspondingly reduced), on a dollar for dollar basis, as if such Voting Participant were a Lender under the applicable Facility with a Commitment and/or Loans (as applicable) in an amount equal to the Dollar amount of the participation purchased, on any matter requiring or allowing such Lender from whom it purchased such participation, in its capacity as a Lender under such Facility, to provide or withhold its consent, or to otherwise vote on any proposed action. To be effective, each Voting Participant Notification shall, with respect to any Voting Participant, (i) state the full name of such Voting Participant, as well as all contact information required of an assignee as set forth in Exhibit E-2 hereto and (ii) state the dollar amount and the applicable Facility of the participation purchased.  The Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely on information contained in notices delivered pursuant to this paragraph.141 Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in the first proviso to Section 10.01 that affects such Participant. Subject to subsection (e) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04 and 3.05 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant shall also be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.08 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.13 as though it were a Lender.  Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as an non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower (such agency being solely for tax purposes), maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant’s interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the “Participant Register”); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant's interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations.  The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.(e)    Limitations upon Participant Rights. A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 3.01 or 3.04 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower’s prior written consent or except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a change in law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.01 if the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section 3.01(e) as though it were a Lender (provided that all forms required under Section 3.01(e) shall instead be delivered to the applicable Lender).(f)    Certain Pledges. Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.142 (g)    Resignation as L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender after Assignment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if at any time a Lender serving as L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender assigns all of its Revolving Credit Commitment and Revolving Credit Loans pursuant to subsection (b) above, such Lender may, (i) upon 30 days’ notice to the Borrower and the other Lenders, resign as the L/C Issuer and/or (ii) upon 30 days’ notice to the Borrower, resign as the Swing Line Lender. In the event of any such resignation as L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender, the Borrower shall be entitled to appoint from among the Lenders a successor L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender hereunder; provided, however, that no failure by the Borrower to appoint any such successor shall affect the resignation of the retiring entity as L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender, as the case may be.  If any entity serving as L/C Issuer resigns as L/C Issuer, it shall retain all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the L/C Issuer hereunder with respect to all Letters of Credit outstanding as of the effective date of its resignation as L/C Issuer and all L/C Obligations with respect thereto (including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Loans or fund risk participations in Unreimbursed Amounts pursuant to Section 2.03(c)). If the entity serving as Swing Line Lender resigns as Swing Line Lender, it shall retain all the rights of the Swing Line Lender provided for hereunder with respect to Swing Line Loans made by it and outstanding as of the effective date of such resignation, including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Loans or fund risk participations in outstanding Swing Line Loans pursuant to Section 2.04(c).  Upon the appointment of a successor L/C Issuer and/or Swing Line Lender and the acceptance of such appointment by such successor, (a) such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender, as the case may be and (b) the successor L/C Issuer shall issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession or make other arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the retiring L/C Issuer to effectively assume the obligations of such L/C Issuer with respect to such Letters of Credit.Section 10.07    Treatment of Certain Information; Confidentiality. Each of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuer agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its Affiliates and to its and its Affiliates’ respective partners, directors, officers, employees, agents, trustees, advisors and representatives (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority purporting to have jurisdiction over it (including any self-regulatory authority, such as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners), (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to any other party hereto, (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or under any other Loan Document or any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section, to (i) any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or any Eligible Assignee invited to be a Lender or (ii) any actual or prospective counterparty (or its advisors) to any swap or derivative transaction relating to the Borrower and its obligations, (g) with the consent of the Borrower, (h) on a confidential basis to (i) any rating agency in connection with rating the Borrower or its Subsidiaries or any Facility or (ii) the CUSIP Service Bureau or any similar agency in connection with the issuance and monitoring of CUSIP numbers with respect to any Facility or (i) to the extent such Information (x) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section or (y) becomes available to the Administrative Agent, any Lender, the L/C Issuer or any of their respective Affiliates on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrower. 143 For purposes of this Section, “Information” means all information received from the Borrower or any Subsidiary relating to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or any of their respective businesses other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the Borrower or any Subsidiary. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information.Each of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuer acknowledges that (a) the Information may include MNPI concerning the Borrower or a Subsidiary, as the case may be, (b) it has developed compliance procedures regarding the use of MNPI and (c) it will handle such MNPI in accordance with applicable Law, including United States Federal and state securities Laws.Section 10.08    Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender, the L/C Issuer and each of their respective Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, in whatever currency) at any time held and other obligations (in whatever currency) at any time owing by such Lender, the L/C Issuer or any such Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower against any and all of the obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Agreement or any other Loan Document to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, irrespective of whether or not such Lender or the L/C Issuer shall have made any demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and although such obligations of the Borrower may be contingent or unmatured or are owed to a branch or office of such Lender or the L/C Issuer different from the branch or office holding such deposit or obligated on such indebtedness; provided that in the event that any Defaulting Lender shall exercise any such right of setoff, (x) all amounts so set off shall be paid over immediately to the Administrative Agent for further application in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.16 and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and (y) the Defaulting Lender shall provide promptly to the Administrative Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the Obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as to which it exercised such right of setoff. The rights of each Lender, the L/C Issuer and their respective Affiliates under this Section are in addition to all other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that such Lender, the L/C Issuer or their respective Affiliates may have under applicable Law or otherwise. Each Lender and the L/C Issuer agrees to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent promptly after any such setoff and application; provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application.Section 10.09    Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid under the Loan Documents shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious interest permitted by applicable Law (the “Maximum Rate”). If the Administrative Agent or any Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the unpaid principal of the Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the Borrower. In determining whether the interest contracted for, charged, or received by the Administrative Agent or any Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather than interest, (b) exclude optional prepayments and the effects thereof and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the Obligations hereunder.144 Section 10.10    Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto in different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement and the other Loan Documents constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof that, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by facsimile or other electronic imaging means shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.Section 10.11    Survival of Representations and Warranties. All representations and warranties made hereunder and in any other Loan Document or other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and thereof. Such representations and warranties have been or will be relied upon by the Administrative Agent and each Lender, regardless of any investigation made by the Administrative Agent or any Lender or on their behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default at the time of any Credit Extension, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as any Loan or any other Obligation hereunder shall remain unpaid or unsatisfied or any Letter of Credit shall remain outstanding.Section 10.12    Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, then, to the fullest extent permitted by law, (a) the legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall not be affected or impaired thereby and (b) the parties shall endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions. The invalidity of a provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this Section 10.12, if and to the extent that the enforceability of any provisions in this Agreement relating to Defaulting Lenders shall be limited by Debtor Relief Laws, as determined in good faith by the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or the Swing Line Lender, as applicable, then such provisions shall be deemed to be in effect only to the extent not so limited.Section 10.13    Replacement of Lenders. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.04, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.01, or if any Lender shall have not consented to any proposed amendment, modification, termination, waiver or consent requiring the consent of all Lenders or all affected Lenders as contemplated by Section 10.01 and the consent of the Required Lenders, Required Revolving Credit Lenders or Required Incremental Term Loan Lenders, as applicable, has been obtained, or if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 10.06), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment), provided that:145 (a)    the Borrower shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the assignment fee specified in Section 10.06(b);(b)    such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans, L/C Advances, funded participations in Swing Line Loans, if any, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under Section 3.05) from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal, L/C Advances, funded participations in Swing Line Loans, if any, and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts);(c)    in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 3.04 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 3.01, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter;(d)    such assignment does not conflict with applicable Laws; and(e)    in the case of any such assignment resulting from a Lender becoming a non-consenting Lender, the applicable assignee shall have consented to the applicable amendment, modification, termination, waiver or consent.A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.  Each Lender and the L/C Issuer hereby agrees and acknowledges that, with regard to any Assignment and Acceptance necessary to effectuate any assignment of such Lender’s or the L/C Issuer’s interests hereunder in the circumstances contemplated by this Section 10.13, consent to such Assignment and Acceptance shall have been deemed to have been given if such Lender or the L/C Issuer has not responded within one Business Day of a request for such consent.

In connection with all aspects of each transaction contemplated hereby (including in connection with any amendment, waiver or other modification hereof or of any other Loan Document), the Borrower acknowledges and agrees that:  (i) (A) the arranging and other services regarding this Agreement provided by the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers, the Syndication Agent and the Documentation Agents are arm’s-length commercial transactions between the Borrower and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers, the Syndication Agent and the Documentation Agents, on the other hand, (B) the Borrower has consulted its own legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent it has deemed appropriate, and (C) the Borrower is capable of evaluating, and understands and accepts, the terms, risks and conditions of the transactions contemplated hereby and by the other Loan Documents; (ii) (A) the Administrative Agent and each of the Arrangers, the Syndication Agent and the Documentation Agents is and has been acting solely as a principal and, except as expressly agreed in writing by the relevant parties, has not been, is not, and will not be acting as an advisor, agent or fiduciary for the Borrower or any of its Affiliates, or any other Person and (B) neither the Administrative Agent nor any of the Arrangers, the Syndication Agent or the Documentation Agents has any obligation to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby except those obligations expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents; and (iii) the Administrative Agent and each of the Arrangers, the Syndication Agent and the Documentation Agents and their respective Affiliates may be engaged in a broad range of transactions that involve interests that differ from those of the Borrower and its Affiliates, and neither the Administrative Agent nor any of the Arrangers, the Syndication Agent or the Documentation Agents has any obligation to disclose any of such interests to the Borrower or its Affiliates. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Borrower hereby waives and releases any claims that it may have against the Administrative Agent and each of the Arrangers, the Syndication Agent and the Documentation Agents with respect to any breach or alleged breach of agency or fiduciary duty in connection with any aspect of any transaction contemplated hereby.Section 10.18    Electronic Execution of Assignments and Certain Other Documents.

L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)) (the “Act”), it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Borrower and each Guarantor, which information includes the name and address of the Borrower and each Guarantor and other information that will allow such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, to identify the Borrower and each Guarantor in accordance with the Act. The Borrower shall, and shall cause each Guarantor to, promptly following a request by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, provide all documentation and other information that the Administrative Agent or such Lender requests in order to comply with its ongoing obligations under applicable “know your customer” and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the Act.Section 10.20    Judgment Currency. If, for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court, it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder or any other Loan Document in one currency into another currency, the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Administrative Agent could purchase the first currency with such other currency on the Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is given.  The obligation of the Borrower in respect of any such sum due from it to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder or under the other Loan Documents shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency (the “Judgment Currency”) other than that in which such sum is denominated in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement (the “Agreement Currency”), be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, of any sum adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency, the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase the Agreement Currency with the Judgment Currency.  If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent or any Lender from the Borrower in the Agreement Currency, the Borrower agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, against such loss.Section 10.21    Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement.

provided that nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent or impair the rights of any of the Applicable Collateral Agent or any other First Lien Claimholder to (i) enforce this Agreement including Section 2.01(b) hereof and (ii) contest or support any other Person in contesting the enforceability of any Lien purporting to secure obligations not constituting First Lien Obligations.(b)Each First Lien Claimholder hereby agrees that if it shall obtain possession of any Shared Collateral or shall realize any proceeds or payment in respect of any Shared Collateral, pursuant to any First Lien Collateral Document or by the exercise of any rights available to it under applicable law or in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding or through any other exercise of remedies (including pursuant to any intercreditor agreement), at any time prior to the Discharge of each of the First Lien Obligations, then it shall hold such Shared Collateral, proceeds or payment in trust for the other First Lien Claimholders having a security interest in such Shared Collateral and promptly transfer any such Shared Collateral, proceeds or payment, as the case may be, to the Applicable Collateral Agent, to be distributed by such Applicable Collateral Agent in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.01(a) hereof, provided, however, that the foregoing shall not apply to any Shared Collateral purchased by any First Lien Claimholder for cash pursuant to any exercise of remedies permitted hereunder.(c)None of the Applicable Collateral Agent, any Applicable Representative or any other First Lien Claimholder shall be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Applicable Collateral Agent, such Applicable Representative or any other First Lien Claimholder with respect to any Collateral in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. 18 SECTION 2.04Automatic Release of Liens.(a)If, at any time any Shared Collateral is transferred to a third party or otherwise disposed of, in each case, in connection with any enforcement by the Applicable Collateral Agent in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, then (whether or not any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding is pending at the time) the Liens in favor of the other Collateral Agents for the benefit of each Series of First Lien Claimholders (or in favor of such other First Lien Claimholders if directly secured by such Liens) upon such Shared Collateral will automatically be released and discharged upon final conclusion of such disposition as and when, but only to the extent, such Liens of the Applicable Collateral Agent on such Shared Collateral are released and discharged; provided that any proceeds of any Shared Collateral realized therefrom shall be applied pursuant to Section 2.01 hereof.  If in connection with any such foreclosure or other exercise of remedies by the Applicable Collateral Agent, the Applicable Collateral Agent or related Applicable Representative of such Series of First Lien Obligations releases any guarantor from its obligation under a guarantee of the Series of First Lien Obligations for which it serves as agent prior to a Discharge of such Series of First Lien Obligations, such guarantor also shall be released from its guarantee of all other First Lien Obligations.  If in connection with any such foreclosure or other exercise of remedies by the Applicable Collateral Agent, the equity interests of any Person are foreclosed upon or otherwise disposed of and the Applicable Collateral Agent releases its Lien on the property or assets of such Person, then the Liens of each other Collateral Agent (or in favor of such other First Lien Claimholders if directly secured by such Liens) with respect to any Collateral consisting of the property or assets of such Person will be automatically released to the same extent as the Liens of the Applicable Collateral Agent are released; provided that any proceeds of any such equity interests foreclosed upon where the Applicable Collateral Agent releases its Lien on the assets of such Person on which another Series of First Lien Obligations holds a Lien on any of the assets of such Person (any such assets, the “Underlying Assets”) which Lien is released as provided in this sentence (any such Proceeds being referred to herein as “Equity Release Proceeds” regardless of whether or not such other Series of First Lien Obligations holds a Lien on such equity interests so disposed of) shall be applied pursuant to Section 2.01 hereof.(b)Without limiting the rights of the Applicable Collateral Agent under Section 4.02, each Collateral Agent and each Representative agrees to execute and deliver (at the sole cost and expense of the Grantors) all such authorizations and other instruments as shall reasonably be requested by the Applicable Collateral Agent to evidence and confirm any release of Shared Collateral, Underlying Assets or guarantee provided for in this Section.SECTION 2.05Certain Agreements with Respect to Bankruptcy or Insolvency Proceedings.(a)This Agreement shall continue in full force and effect notwithstanding the commencement of any proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code or any other Federal, state or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or similar law by or against any Grantor or any of its subsidiaries. 19 (b)If any Grantor shall become subject to a case (a “Bankruptcy Case”) under the Bankruptcy Code and shall, as debtor(s)-in-possession, move for approval of financing (“DIP Financing”) to be provided by one or more lenders (the “DIP Lenders”) under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code or the use of cash collateral under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code, each First Lien Claimholder (other than any Controlling Claimholder or any Representative of any Controlling Claimholder) agrees that it will not raise any objection to any such financing or to the Liens on the Shared Collateral securing the same (“DIP Financing Liens”) or to any use of cash collateral that constitutes Shared Collateral, unless a Representative of the Controlling Claimholders shall then oppose or object to such DIP Financing or such DIP Financing Liens or use of cash collateral (and (i) to the extent that such DIP Financing Liens are senior to the Liens on any such Shared Collateral for the benefit of the Controlling Claimholders, each Non-Controlling Claimholder will subordinate its Liens with respect to such Shared Collateral on the same terms as the Liens of the Controlling Claimholders (other than any Liens of any First Lien Claimholders constituting DIP Financing Liens) are subordinated thereto, and (ii) to the extent that such DIP Financing Liens rank pari passu with the Liens on any such Shared Collateral granted to secure the First Lien Obligations of the Controlling Claimholders, each Non-Controlling Claimholder will confirm the priorities with respect to such Shared Collateral as set forth herein), in each case so long as (A) the First Lien Claimholders of each Series retain the benefit of their Liens on all such Shared Collateral pledged to the DIP Lenders, including proceeds thereof arising after the commencement of such proceeding, with the same priority vis-à-vis all the other First Lien Claimholders (other than any Liens of the First Lien Claimholders constituting DIP Financing Liens) as existed prior to the commencement of the Bankruptcy Case, (B) the First Lien Claimholders of each Series are granted Liens on any additional collateral pledged to any First Lien Claimholders as adequate protection or otherwise in connection with such DIP Financing or use of cash collateral, with the same priority vis-à-vis the First Lien Claimholders as set forth in this Agreement (other than any Liens of any First Lien Claimholders constituting DIP Financing Liens), (C) if any amount of such DIP Financing or cash collateral is applied to repay any of the First Lien Obligations, such amount is applied pursuant to Section 2.01(a) of this Agreement, and (D) if any First Lien Claimholders are granted adequate protection with respect to the First Lien Obligations subject hereto, including in the form of periodic payments, in connection with such use of cash collateral, the proceeds of such adequate protection are applied pursuant to Section 2.01(a) of this Agreement; provided that the First Lien Claimholders of each Series shall have a right to object to the grant of a Lien to secure the DIP Financing over any Collateral subject to Liens in favor of the First Lien Claimholders of such Series or its Representative that shall not constitute Shared Collateral (unless such Collateral fails to constitute Shared Collateral because the Lien in respect thereof constitutes a Declined Lien with respect to such First Lien Claimholders or their Representative or Collateral Agent); provided, further, that the First Lien Claimholders receiving adequate protection shall not object to any other First Lien Claimholder receiving adequate protection comparable to any adequate protection granted to such First Lien Claimholders in connection with a DIP Financing or use of cash collateral.(c)If any First Lien Claimholder is granted adequate protection (A) in the form of Liens on any additional collateral, then each other First Lien Claimholder shall be entitled to seek, and each First Lien Claimholder will consent and not object to, adequate protection in the form of Liens on such additional collateral with the same priority vis-à-vis the First Lien Claimholders as set forth in this Agreement, (B) in the form of a superpriority or other administrative claim, then each other First Lien Claimholder shall be entitled to seek, and each First Lien Claimholder will consent and not object to, adequate protection in the form of a pari passu superpriority or administrative claim or (C) in the form of periodic or other cash payments, then the proceeds of such adequate protection must be applied to all First Lien Obligations pursuant to Section 2.01. 20 SECTION 2.06Reinstatement.In the event that any of the First Lien Obligations shall be paid in full and such payment or any part thereof shall subsequently, for whatever reason (including an order or judgment for disgorgement of a preference under Title 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, or any similar law, or the settlement of any claim in respect thereof), be required to be returned or repaid, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be fully applicable thereto until all such First Lien Obligations shall again have been paid in full in cash.  This Section 2.06 shall survive termination of this Agreement.SECTION 2.07Insurance and Condemnation Awards.As among the First Lien Claimholders, the Applicable Collateral Agent (acting at the direction of the Applicable Representative), shall have the right, but not the obligation, to adjust or settle any insurance policy or claim covering or constituting Shared Collateral in the event of any loss thereunder and to approve any award granted in any condemnation or similar proceeding affecting the Shared Collateral.  To the extent any Collateral Agent or any other First Lien Claimholder receives proceeds of such insurance policy and such proceeds are not permitted or required to be returned to any Grantor under the applicable First Lien Documents, such proceeds shall be turned over to the Applicable Collateral Agent for application as provided in Section 2.01 hereof.SECTION 2.08Refinancings.The First Lien Obligations of any Series may, subject to Section 5.14, be Refinanced, in whole or in part, in each case, without notice to, or the consent (except to the extent a consent is otherwise required to permit the Refinancing transaction under any First Lien Document) of any First Lien Claimholder of any other Series, all without affecting the priorities provided for herein or the other provisions hereof; provided that the Representative and Collateral Agent of the holders of any such Refinancing Indebtedness shall have executed a Joinder Agreement on behalf of the holders of such Refinancing Indebtedness.  If such Refinancing Indebtedness is intended to constitute a Replacement Credit Agreement, the Company shall so state in its Designation.SECTION 2.09Gratuitous Bailee/Agent for Perfection.(a)The Applicable Collateral Agent shall be entitled to hold any Possessory Collateral constituting Shared Collateral. 21 (b)Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Collateral Agent agrees to hold any Possessory Collateral constituting Shared Collateral and any other Shared Collateral from time to time in its possession or control (or in the possession or control of its agents or bailees) as gratuitous bailee for the benefit of each other First Lien Claimholder (such bailment being intended, among other things, to satisfy the requirements of Sections 8-106(d)(3), 8-301(a)(2) and 9-313(c) of the UCC) and any assignee, solely for the purpose of perfecting the security interest granted in such Shared Collateral, if any, pursuant to the applicable First Lien Collateral Documents, in each case, subject to the terms and conditions of this Section 2.09.  Solely with respect to any Deposit Accounts constituting Shared Collateral under the control (within the meaning of Section 9-104 of the UCC) of any Collateral Agent, each such Collateral Agent agrees to also hold control over such Deposit Accounts as gratuitous agent for each other First Lien Claimholder and any assignee solely for the purpose of perfecting the security interest in such Deposit Accounts, subject to the terms and conditions of this Section 2.09.(c)No Collateral Agent shall have any obligation whatsoever to any First Lien Claimholder to ensure that the Possessory Collateral and Control Collateral is genuine or owned by any of the Grantors or to preserve rights or benefits of any Person except as expressly set forth in this Section 2.09.  The duties or responsibilities of each Collateral Agent under this Section 2.09 shall be limited solely to holding any Possessory Collateral constituting Shared Collateral or any other Shared Collateral in its possession or control as gratuitous bailee (and with respect to Deposit Accounts, as gratuitous agent) in accordance with this Section 2.09 and delivering the Possessory Collateral constituting Shared Collateral as provided in Section 2.09(e) below.(d)None of the Collateral Agents or any of the First Lien Claimholders shall have by reason of the First Lien Documents, this Agreement or any other document a fiduciary relationship in respect of the other Collateral Agents or any other First Lien Claimholder, and each Collateral Agent and each First Lien Claimholder hereby waives and releases the other Collateral Agents and First Lien Claimholders from all claims and liabilities arising pursuant to any Collateral Agent’s role under this Section 2.09 as gratuitous bailee with respect to the Possessory Collateral constituting Shared Collateral or any other Shared Collateral in its possession or control (and with respect to the Deposit Accounts, as gratuitous agent).(e)At any time the Applicable Collateral Agent is no longer the Applicable Collateral Agent, such outgoing Applicable Collateral Agent shall deliver the remaining Possessory Collateral constituting Shared Collateral in its possession (if any) together with any necessary endorsements (which endorsement shall be without recourse and without any representation or warranty), first, to the then Applicable Collateral Agent to the extent First Lien Obligations remain outstanding and second, to the applicable Grantor to the extent no First Lien Obligations remain outstanding (in each case, so as to allow such Person to obtain possession or control of such Shared Collateral) or to whomever may be lawfully entitled to receive the same.  The outgoing Applicable Collateral Agent further agrees to take all other action reasonably requested by the then Applicable Collateral Agent at the expense of the Company in connection with the then Applicable Collateral Agent obtaining a first-priority security interest in the Shared Collateral.SECTION 2.10Amendments to First Lien Collateral Documents.(a)Without the prior written consent of each other Collateral Agent, each Collateral Agent agrees that no First Lien Collateral Document may be amended, restated, amended and restated, supplemented, replaced or Refinanced or otherwise modified from time to time or entered into to the extent such amendment, supplement, Refinancing or modification, or the terms of any new First Lien Collateral Document, would be prohibited by, or would require any Grantor to act or refrain from acting in a manner that would violate, any of the terms of this Agreement. 22 (b)In determining whether an amendment to any First Lien Collateral Document is permitted by this Section 2.10, each Collateral Agent may conclusively rely on an officer’s certificate of the Company stating that such amendment is permitted by this Section 2.10.SECTION 2.11Similar Liens and Agreements.(a)Subject to Section 2.11(b) below, the parties hereto agree that it is their intention that the Collateral be identical for all First Lien Claimholders; provided, that this provision will not be violated with respect to any particular Series if the First Lien Document for such Series prohibits the Collateral Agent for that Series from accepting a Lien on such asset or property or such Collateral Agent otherwise expressly declines to accept a Lien on such asset or property (any such prohibited or declined Liens with respect to a particular Series, a “Declined Lien”).  In furtherance of, but subject to, the foregoing, the parties hereto agree, subject to the other provisions of this Agreement:(i)upon request by any Collateral Agent, to cooperate in good faith (and to direct their counsel to cooperate in good faith) from time to time in order to determine the specific items included in the Shared Collateral and the steps taken to perfect their respective Liens thereon and the identity of the respective parties obligated under the Credit Agreement Documents and the Other First Lien Documents; and(ii)that the documents and agreements creating or evidencing the Liens on Shared Collateral securing the Credit Agreement Obligations and the Other First Lien Obligations shall, subject to the terms and conditions of Section 5.02, be in all material respects the same forms of documents as one another, except that the documents and agreements creating or evidencing the Liens securing the Other First Lien Obligations may contain additional provisions as may be necessary or appropriate to establish the intercreditor arrangements among the various separate classes of creditors holding Other First Lien Obligations and to address any Declined Lien.(b)Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or any other First Lien Documents to the contrary, Collateral consisting of cash and cash equivalents pledged to secure reimbursement obligations in respect of letters of credit shall solely secure and shall be applied as specified in the Credit Agreement or Other First Lien Agreement, as applicable, pursuant to which such letters of credit were issued and will not constitute Shared Collateral.ARTICLE III.EXISTENCE AND AMOUNTS OF LIENS AND OBLIGATIONS 23 Whenever any Applicable Collateral Agent or any Applicable Representative shall be required, in connection with the exercise of its rights or the performance of its obligations hereunder, to determine the existence or amount of any First Lien Obligations of any Series, or the Shared Collateral subject to any Lien securing the First Lien Obligations of any Series, it may request that such information be furnished to it in writing by each other Representative or each other Collateral Agent and shall be entitled to make such determination or not make any determination on the basis of the information so furnished; provided, however, that if a Representative or a Collateral Agent shall fail or refuse reasonably promptly to provide the requested information, the requesting Applicable Collateral Agent or Applicable Representative shall be entitled to make any such determination or not make any determination by such method as it may, in the exercise of its good faith judgment, determine, including by reliance upon a certificate of the Company.  Each Applicable Collateral Agent and each Applicable Representative may rely conclusively, and shall be fully protected in so relying, on any determination made by it in accordance with the provisions of the preceding sentence (or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction) and shall have no liability to any Grantor, any First Lien Claimholder or any other person as a result of such determination.ARTICLE IV.THE APPLICABLE COLLATERAL AGENTSECTION 4.01Authority.(a)Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, nothing herein shall be construed to impose any fiduciary or other duty on any Applicable Collateral Agent to any Non-Controlling Claimholder or give any Non-Controlling Claimholder the right to direct any Applicable Collateral Agent, except that each Applicable Collateral Agent shall be obligated to distribute proceeds of any Shared Collateral in accordance with Section 2.01 hereof.(b)In furtherance of the foregoing, each Non-Controlling Claimholder acknowledges and agrees that the Applicable Collateral Agent shall be entitled, for the benefit of the First Lien Claimholders, to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of or deal with any Shared Collateral as provided herein and in the First Lien Collateral Documents, as applicable, without regard to any rights to which the Non-Controlling Claimholders would otherwise be entitled as a result of the First Lien Obligations held by such Non-Controlling Claimholders.  Without limiting the foregoing, each Non-Controlling Claimholder agrees that none of the Applicable Collateral Agent, the Applicable Representative or any other First Lien Claimholder shall have any duty or obligation first to marshal or realize upon any type of Shared Collateral (or any other Collateral securing any of the First Lien Obligations), or to sell, dispose of or otherwise liquidate all or any portion of such Shared Collateral (or any other Collateral securing any First Lien Obligations), in any manner that would maximize the return to the Non-Controlling Claimholders, notwithstanding that the order and timing of any such realization, sale, disposition or liquidation may affect the amount of proceeds actually received by the Non-Controlling Claimholders from such realization, sale, disposition or liquidation.  Each of the First Lien Claimholders waives any claim it may now or hereafter have against any Collateral Agent or Representative of any other Series of First Lien Obligations or any other First Lien Claimholder of any other Series arising out of (i) any actions which any such Collateral Agent, Representative or any First Lien Claimholder represented by it take or omit to take (including actions with respect to the creation, perfection or continuation of Liens on any Collateral, actions with respect to the foreclosure upon, sale, release or depreciation of, or failure to realize upon, any of the Collateral and actions with respect to the collection of any claim for all or any part of the First Lien Obligations from any account debtor, guarantor or any other party) in accordance with the First Lien Collateral Documents or any other agreement related thereto or in connection with the collection of the First Lien Obligations or the valuation, use, protection or release of any security for the First Lien Obligations; provided that nothing in this clause (i) shall be construed to prevent or impair the rights of any Collateral Agent or Representative to enforce this Agreement, (ii) any election by any Applicable Representative or any holders of First Lien Obligations, in any proceeding instituted under the Bankruptcy Code, of the application of Section 1111(b) of the Bankruptcy Code or (iii) subject to Section 2.05, any borrowing, or grant of a security interest or administrative expense priority under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code or any equivalent provision of any other Bankruptcy Law, by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as debtor-in-possession.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Applicable Collateral Agent shall not (i) accept any Shared Collateral in full or partial satisfaction of any First Lien Obligations pursuant to Section 9-620 of the Uniform Commercial Code of any jurisdiction,  24 without the consent of each Representative representing holders of First Lien Obligations for whom such Collateral constitutes Shared Collateral or (ii) “credit bid” for or purchase (other than for cash) Shared Collateral at any public, private or judicial foreclosure upon such Shared Collateral, without the consent of each Representative representing holders of First Lien Obligations for whom such Collateral constitutes Shared Collateral.SECTION 4.02Power-of-Attorney.Each Non-Controlling Representative and Collateral Agent that is not the Applicable Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of each other First Lien Claimholder of the Series for whom it is acting, hereby irrevocably appoints the Applicable Collateral Agent and any officer or agent of the Applicable Collateral Agent, which appointment is coupled with an interest with full power of substitution, as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full irrevocable power and authority in the place and stead of such Non-Controlling Representative, Collateral Agent or First Lien Claimholder, to take any and all appropriate action and to execute any and all documents and instruments which may be necessary to accomplish the purposes of this Agreement, including the exercise of any and all remedies under each First Lien Collateral Document with respect to Shared Collateral and the execution of releases in connection therewith.ARTICLE V.MISCELLANEOUSSECTION 5.01Integration/Conflicts.This Agreement, together with the other First Lien Documents and the First Lien Collateral Documents, represents the entire agreement of each of the Grantors and the First Lien Claimholders with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersedes any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof and thereof.  There are no promises, undertakings, representations or warranties by any Representative, Collateral Agent or First Lien Claimholder relative to the subject matter hereof and thereof not expressly set forth or referred to herein or therein.  In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and the provisions of the First Lien Documents the provisions of this Agreement shall govern and control. 25 SECTION 5.02Effectiveness; Continuing Nature of this Agreement; Severability.This Agreement shall become effective when executed and delivered by the parties hereto.  This is a continuing agreement and the First Lien Claimholders of any Series may continue, at any time and without notice to any First Lien Claimholder of any other Series, to extend credit and other financial accommodations and lend monies to or for the benefit of the Company or any Grantor constituting First Lien Obligations in reliance hereon.  Each Representative and each Collateral Agent, on behalf of itself and each other First Lien Claimholder represented by it, hereby waives any right it may have under applicable law to revoke this Agreement or any of the provisions of this Agreement.  The terms of this Agreement shall survive, and shall continue in full force and effect, in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding.  Any provision of this Agreement that is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.  The parties hereto shall endeavor in good-faith negotiations to replace any invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to those of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions.  All references to the Company or any other Grantor shall include the Company or such Grantor as debtor and debtor in possession and any receiver, trustee or similar person for the Company or any other Grantor (as the case may be) in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding.  This Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force and effect with respect to any Representative or Collateral Agent and the First Lien Claimholders represented by such Representative or Collateral Agent and their First Lien Obligations, on the date on which no First Lien Obligations of such First Lien Claimholders are any longer secured by, or required to be secured by, any of the Collateral pursuant to the terms of the applicable First Lien Documents, subject to the rights of the First Lien Claimholders under Section 2.06; provided, however, that such termination shall not relieve any such party of its obligations incurred hereunder prior to the date of such termination.SECTION 5.03Amendments; Waivers.(a)No amendment, modification or waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed to be made unless the same shall be in writing signed on behalf of each party hereto or its authorized agent and each waiver, if any, shall be a waiver only with respect to the specific instance involved and shall in no way impair the rights of the parties making such waiver or the obligations of the other parties to such party in any other respect or at any other time.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and the other Grantors shall not have any right to consent to or approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement except to the extent their rights and obligations are adversely affected.(b)Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any First Lien Claimholder, any Representative and Collateral Agent may become a party hereto by execution and delivery of a Joinder Agreement in accordance with Section 5.14 of this Agreement and upon such execution and delivery, such Representative and Collateral Agent and the Other First Lien Claimholders and Other First Lien Obligations of the Series for which such Representative and Collateral Agent is acting shall be subject to the terms hereof. 26 (c)Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any other Representative or First Lien Claimholder, the Applicable Collateral Agent may effect amendments and modifications to this Agreement to the extent necessary to reflect any incurrence of any Other First Lien Obligations in compliance with the Credit Agreement and the other First Lien Documents.SECTION 5.04Information Concerning Financial Condition of the Grantors and their Subsidiaries.The Representative and Collateral Agent and the other First Lien Claimholders of each Series shall each be responsible for keeping themselves informed of (a) the financial condition of the Grantors and their Subsidiaries and all endorsers and/or guarantors of the First Lien Obligations and (b) all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the First Lien Obligations.  The Representative and Collateral Agent and the other First Lien Claimholders of each Series shall have no duty to advise the Representative, Collateral Agent or First Lien Claimholders of any other Series of information known to it or them regarding such condition or any such circumstances or otherwise.  In the event the Representative or Collateral Agent or any of the other First Lien Claimholders, in its or their sole discretion, undertakes at any time or from time to time to provide any such information to the Representative, Collateral Agent or First Lien Claimholders of any other Series, it or they shall be under no obligation:(a)to make, and such Representative and Collateral Agent and such other First Lien Claimholders shall not make, any express or implied representation or warranty, including with respect to the accuracy, completeness, truthfulness or validity of any such information so provided;(b)to provide any additional information or to provide any such information on any subsequent occasion;(c)to undertake any investigation; or(d)to disclose any information, which pursuant to accepted or reasonable commercial finance practices, such party wishes to maintain confidential or is otherwise required to maintain confidential.SECTION 5.05Submission to Jurisdiction; Certain Waivers.Each of the Company, each other Grantor, each Collateral Agent and each Representative, on behalf of itself and each other First Lien Claimholder represented by it, hereby irrevocably and unconditionally:(a)submits for itself and its property in any legal action or proceeding relating to this Agreement and the First Lien Collateral Documents (whether arising in contract, tort or otherwise) to which it is a party, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect thereof, to the exclusive (subject to Section 5.05(c) below) general jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York sitting in the Borough of Manhattan, the courts of the United States for the Southern District of New York sitting in the Borough of Manhattan, and appellate courts from any thereof; 27 (b)agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding shall be heard and determined in such New York state court or, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in such federal court;(c)agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law and that nothing in this Agreement or any other First Lien Document shall affect any right that any Collateral Agent, Representative or other First Lien Claimholder may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other First Lien Document against such Grantor or any of its assets in the courts of any jurisdiction;(d)waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other First Lien Collateral Document in any court referred to in Section 5.05(a) (and irrevocably waives to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court);(e)consents to service of process in any such proceeding in any such court by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the applicable party at its address provided in accordance with Section 5.07 (and agrees that nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any part
