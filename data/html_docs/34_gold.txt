(a)                                 Subject to and upon the terms and conditions herein set forth, each Lender severally agrees to make a term loan (each a Loan and, collectively, the Loans) to the Borrower, on the Closing Date, which Loans (i) may, at the option of the Borrower, be incurred and maintained as, and/or converted into, ABR Loans or LIBOR Loans and (ii) may be repaid in accordance with the provisions hereof and shall be repaid in full on the Maturity Date.  Amounts repaid or prepaid in respect of the Loans may not be reborrowed.
 
(b)                                 The Borrower shall use the proceeds from the Loans for the repayment of indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Agreement, to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and for general corporate purposes of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries.
 
13





 
2.2                               Minimum Amount of Each Borrowing; Maximum Number of Borrowings.
 
The aggregate principal amount of each Borrowing of Loans shall be in a multiple of $100,000 and shall not be less than the Minimum Borrowing Amount. More than one Borrowing may occur on any date; provided that at no time shall there be outstanding more than four (4) Borrowings of LIBOR Loans under this Agreement.
 
2.3                               Notice of Borrowing. (a)       To request the Loans to be made hereunder on the Closing Date, the Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent at an office of the Administrative Agent set forth for the Administrative Agent in Section 12.2(a)(ii), (i) the written Notice of Borrowing (including an electronic writing) prior to 12:00 Noon (New York time) at least two Business Days prior to the proposed day of the Borrowing of LIBOR Loans and (ii) the written Notice of Borrowing (including an electronic writing) prior to 12:00 Noon (New York time) on the Business Day prior to the proposed day of the Borrowing of ABR Loans. Such Notice of Borrowing shall be irrevocable and shall specify (i) the aggregate principal amount of the Loans to be made pursuant to such Borrowing, (ii) the date of Borrowing (which shall be a Business Day), (iii) whether the Borrowing shall consist of ABR Loans or LIBOR Loans, (iv) if such Borrowing shall consist of LIBOR Loans, the LIBOR Period to be initially applicable thereto and (v) the number and location of the account to which funds are to be disbursed. The Administrative Agent shall promptly give each Lender written notice (or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing) of the matters covered by the Notice of Borrowing.
 
(b)                                 Without in any way limiting the obligation of the Borrower to confirm in writing any notice it may give hereunder by telephone, the Administrative Agent may act prior to receipt of written confirmation without liability upon the basis of such telephonic notice believed by the Administrative Agent in good faith to be from an Authorized Officer of the sole manager of the Borrower. In each such case the Borrower hereby waives the right to dispute the Administrative Agents record of the terms of any such telephonic notice.
 
2.4                               Disbursement of Funds.
 
(a)                                 No later than 12:00 Noon (New York time) on the Closing Date, each Lender will make available its pro rata portion of the Borrowing requested to be made on such date in an amount equal to its Commitment in the manner provided below.
 
(b)                                 Each Lender shall make available all amounts it is to fund under the Borrowing on the Closing Date in immediately available funds to the Administrative Agent at an office of the Administrative Agent from time to time notified by the Administrative Agent to the Lenders (but initially the office set forth for the Administrative Agent in Section 12.2(a)(ii)), and the Administrative Agent will make available to the Borrower by depositing such funds as specified in the Notice of Borrowing, the aggregate of the amounts so made available. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified by any Lender prior to the Closing Date that such Lender does not intend to make available to the Administrative Agent its portion of the Borrowing to be made on such date, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such amount available to the Administrative Agent on such date, and the Administrative Agent, in reliance upon such assumption, may (in its sole discretion and without any obligation to do so) make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount.  If such corresponding amount
 
14





 
is not in fact made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender and the Administrative Agent has made available same to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such corresponding amount from such Lender. If such Lender does not pay such corresponding amount forthwith upon the Administrative Agents demand therefor, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower, and the Borrower shall immediately pay such corresponding amount to the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover from such Lender or the Borrower, as the case may be, interest on such corresponding amount in respect of each day from the date such corresponding amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower to the date such corresponding amount is recovered by the Administrative Agent, at a rate per annum equal to (i) if paid by such Lender, at the Federal Funds Effective Rate or (ii) if paid by the Borrower, the then-applicable rate of interest, calculated in accordance with Section 2.8, for the respective Loans.
 
(c)                                  Nothing in this Section 2.4 shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill its commitments hereunder or to prejudice any rights that the Borrower may have against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder (it being understood, however, that no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to fulfill its commitments hereunder).
 
2.5                               Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt.

(c)                                  The Administrative Agent shall maintain the Register pursuant to Section 12.6, and a sub-account for each Lender, in which Register and sub-accounts (taken together) shall be recorded (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Type of each Loan made and the LIBOR Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder from the Borrower and each Lenders share thereof.
 
(d)                                 The entries made in the Register and accounts and subaccounts maintained pursuant to paragraphs (b) and (c) of this Section shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations of the Borrower therein recorded; provided that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such account, such Register or such subaccount, as applicable, or any error therein, shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay (with applicable interest) the Loans made to the Borrower by such Lender in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. In the event that there is an inconsistency between the accounts maintained by a Lender pursuant to Section 2.5(b)
 
15





 
and the Register maintained by the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 12.6, the said Register shall prevail.
 
(e)                                  All payments to be made by the Administrative Agent to any Lender hereunder shall be made in accordance with the payment instructions of such Lender set forth on the signature page of such Lender hereunder or, if such Lender is an Assignee, set forth in the Assignment and Assumption of such Lender.
 
(f)                                   Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by a promissory note.  In such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to the order of such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) and in a form approved by the Administrative Agent.  Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 12.6) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns).

(a)                                 The Borrower shall have the option on any Business Day to convert all or a portion equal to at least the Minimum Borrowing Amount of the outstanding principal amount of Loans made to the Borrower of one Type into a Borrowing or Borrowings of another permitted Type or to continue the outstanding principal amount of any LIBOR Loans as LIBOR Loans for an additional LIBOR Period; provided that (i) no partial continuation of LIBOR Loans shall reduce the outstanding principal amount of LIBOR Loans made pursuant to a single Borrowing to less than the Minimum Borrowing Amount, (ii) ABR Loans may not be converted into LIBOR Loans, if a Default or Event of Default is in existence on the date of the proposed conversion and the Administrative Agent has or the Required Lenders have determined in its or their sole discretion not to permit such conversion, (iii) LIBOR Loans may not be continued as LIBOR Loans for an additional LIBOR Period if a Default or Event of Default is in existence on the date of the proposed continuation and the Administrative Agent has or the Required Lenders have determined in its or their sole discretion not to permit such continuation, (iv) no LIBOR Period in excess of one month may be selected for any LIBOR Loan if a Default or Event of Default is in existence on the date of the proposed continuation and the Administrative Agent has or the Required Lenders have determined in its or their sole discretion not to permit such longer LIBOR Period, (v) Borrowings resulting from continuations or conversions pursuant to this Section 2.6 shall be limited in number as provided in Section 2.2 and (vi) the outstanding principal amount of a Loan of one Type may not be converted into a Borrowing of another permitted Type until the end of the current LIBOR Period for such Loan. Each such continuation or conversion shall be effected by the Borrower by giving the Administrative Agent at the location set forth in Section 12.2 prior to 12:00 Noon (New York time) at least three Business Days prior written notice substantially in the form of Exhibit B (or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing) (each a Notice of Continuation) specifying the Loans to be so continued or converted, the Type of Loans to be continued or converted into and, if such Loans are to be converted or continued as LIBOR Loans, the LIBOR Period to be initially applicable thereto. The Administrative Agent shall give each Lender notice as promptly as practicable of
 
16





 
any such proposed continuation or conversion affecting any of its Loans. This Section 2.6 shall not be construed to permit the Borrower to change the currency of any Borrowing.
 
(b)                                 If any Default or Event of Default is in existence at the time of any proposed continuation of any LIBOR Loans and the Administrative Agent has or the Required Lenders have determined in its or their sole discretion not to permit such continuation, such LIBOR Loans shall be automatically converted on the last day of the current LIBOR Period into ABR Loans.
 
(c)                                  If upon the expiration of any LIBOR Period, the Borrower has failed to elect a new LIBOR Period to be applicable thereto as provided in paragraph (a) above, the Borrower shall be deemed to have elected to convert such Borrowing of LIBOR Loans, as the case may be, into a Borrowing of ABR Loans, as the case may be, effective as of the expiration date of such current LIBOR Period.
 
2.7                               Pro Rata Borrowings.
 
The Borrowing of Loans under this Agreement shall be made by the Lenders pro rata on the basis of their respective Commitment Percentages. It is understood that no Lender shall be responsible for any default by any other Lender in its obligation to make Loans hereunder and that each Lender shall be obligated to make the Loans provided to be made by it hereunder, regardless of the failure of any other Lender to fulfill its commitments hereunder.

(b)                                 The unpaid principal amount of each LIBOR Loan shall bear interest from the date of the Borrowing thereof until maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise and both before and after default and judgment) at a rate per annum that shall at all times be equal to the Applicable Margin for LIBOR Loans plus the relevant LIBOR.

(c)                                  if any LIBOR Period would otherwise expire on a day that is not a Business Day, such LIBOR Period shall expire on the next succeeding Business Day; provided that if any LIBOR Period in respect of a LIBOR Loan would otherwise expire on a day that is not a Business Day but is a day of the month after which no further Business Day occurs in such month, such LIBOR Period shall expire on the next preceding Business Day; and

(ii)                                  at any time, that the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall incur increased costs or reductions in the amounts received or receivable hereunder with respect to any Loans (other than any such increase or reduction attributable to (A) Taxes, (B) Other Taxes, (C) taxes excluded by Section 5.3(a)(i) or Section 5.3(a)(ii) or (D) taxes excluded by Section 5.3(b)) because of (x) any change since the date hereof in any applicable law, governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order (or in the interpretation or administration thereof and including the introduction of any new law or governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order), such as, for example, but not limited to, a change in official reserve requirements (including any reserve requirements specified under regulations issued from time to time by the F.R.S. Board and then applicable to assets or liabilities consisting of and including Eurocurrency Liabilities as therein defined or the imposition of any tax on the Administrative Agent or any Lender on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto), and/or (y) with respect to LIBOR Loans only, other circumstances affecting the London interbank market; or
 
(iii)                               at any time, that the making or continuance of any LIBOR Loan has become unlawful by compliance by such Lender in good faith with any law, governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order (or would conflict with any such governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order not having the force of law even though the failure to comply therewith would not be unlawful), or has become impracticable as a result of a contingency occurring after the date hereof that materially and adversely affects the London interbank market;
 
then, and in any such event, the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall within a reasonable time thereafter give notice (if by telephone confirmed in writing) to the Borrower and, as the case may be, to the Administrative Agent of such determination (which notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to each of the other Lenders). Thereafter (x) in the case of clause (i) above, LIBOR Loans shall no longer be available from such Lender (and such Lenders obligation to make such Loans shall be suspended) until such time as such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent, the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such

notice by the Administrative Agent no longer exist (which notice such Lender agrees to give at such time when such circumstances no longer exist), and the Notice of Borrowing or any Notice of Continuation given by the Borrower with respect to LIBOR Loans that have not yet been incurred shall be deemed, with respect to such Lender only, to be the Notice of Borrowing or a Notice of Continuation for ABR Loans, (y) in the case of clause (ii) above, the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent or such Lender, within five (5) days after receipt of written demand therefor, such additional amounts (in the form of an increased rate of, or a different method of calculating, interest or otherwise as such Lender in its reasonable discretion shall determine) as shall be required to compensate the Administrative Agent or such Lender for such increased costs or reductions in amounts receivable hereunder (it being agreed that a written notice as to the additional amounts owed to the Administrative Agent or such Lender, showing in reasonable detail the basis for the calculation thereof, submitted to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall, absent clearly demonstrable error, be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto, provided that the determination of such additional amounts shall be made in good faith (and not on an arbitrary or capricious basis) and consistent with similarly situated customers of the applicable Lender (after consideration of such factors as such Lender then reasonably determines to be relevant)) and (z) in the case of clause (iii) above, the Borrower shall take one of the actions specified in Section 2.10(b) as promptly as possible and, in any event, within the time period required by law.
 
(b)                                 At any time that any LIBOR Loan is affected by the circumstances described in Section 2.10(a)(ii) or 2.10(a)(iii), the Borrower may (and in the case of a LIBOR Loan affected pursuant to Section 2.10(a)(iii) shall) either (i) if the affected LIBOR Loan is then being made pursuant to a Credit Event or Borrowing by way of conversion into a LIBOR Loan, cancel said Credit Event or Borrowing by giving the Administrative Agent telephonic notice (confirmed promptly in writing) thereof on the same date that the Borrower was notified by a Lender pursuant to Section 2.10(a)(ii) or 2.10(a)(iii), or (ii) if the affected LIBOR Loan is then outstanding, upon at least three Business Days notice to the Administrative Agent, require the affected Lender to convert each such LIBOR Loan into an ABR Loan; provided that if more than one Lender is affected at any time, then all affected Lenders must be treated in the same manner pursuant to this Section 2.10(b).
 
(c)                                  If, after the date hereof, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy or liquidity requirements, or any change therein, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority, or compliance by a Lender or its parent with any request or directive made or adopted after the date hereof regarding capital adequacy or liquidity requirements (whether or not having the force of law) of any such Governmental Authority, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lenders or its parents capital or assets as a consequence of such Lenders commitments or obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Lender or its parent could have achieved but for such adoption, effectiveness, change or compliance (taking into consideration such Lenders or its parents policies with respect to capital adequacy and liquidity requirements), then within five (5) days after written demand (as described below) by such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or its parent for such reduction, it being understood and agreed, however, that a Lender shall not be entitled to such compensation as a result of such Lenders compliance with, or pursuant to any request or directive to comply with, any such law,

rule or regulation as in effect on the date hereof. Each Lender, upon determining that any additional amounts will be payable pursuant to this Section 2.10(c) (provided that such determination of additional amounts shall be made in good faith (and not on an arbitrary or capricious basis) and consistent with similarly situated customers of the applicable Lender (after consideration of such factors as such Lender then reasonably determines to be relevant)), will give prompt written notice thereof to the Borrower, which notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis of the calculation of such additional amounts (it being agreed that a written notice as to the additional amounts owed to the Administrative Agent or such Lender, showing in reasonable detail the basis for the calculation thereof, submitted to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall, absent clearly demonstrable error, be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto, provided that the determination of such additional amounts shall be made in good faith (and not on an arbitrary or capricious basis) and consistent with similarly situated customers of the applicable Lender (after consideration of such factors as such Lender then reasonably determines to be relevant), although the failure to give any such notice shall not, subject to Section 2.13, release or diminish the Borrowers obligations to pay additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.10(c) upon receipt of such notice.
 
(d)                                 For purposes of this Section 2.10, and notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and all requests, rules, requirements, guidelines and directives thereunder or issued in connection therewith or in implementation thereof and (ii) all requests, rules, guidelines, requirements and directives promulgated by the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (or any successor or similar authority) or the United States or foreign regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to Basel III, shall in each case shall be deemed to have been enacted, adopted and issued after the date hereof, regardless of the date enacted, adopted, issued or implemented.
 
Subject to Section 2.13, the provisions of this Section 2.10 shall survive the repayment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.
 
2.11                        Compensation.
 
If (a) any payment of principal of any LIBOR Loan, or any continuation of any LIBOR Loan, is made by the Borrower (or a replacement Lender in the case of Section 12.7) to or for the account of a Lender other than on the last day of the LIBOR Period pursuant to Section 2.5, 2.6, 2.10, 5.1 or 12.7, as a result of acceleration of the maturity of the Loans pursuant to Article 10 or for any other reason, (b) any Borrowing of LIBOR Loans is not made as a result of a withdrawn Notice of Borrowing, (c) any ABR Loan is not converted into a LIBOR Loan as a result of a withdrawn Notice of Continuation, (d) any LIBOR Loan is not continued as a LIBOR Loan as a result of a withdrawn Notice of Continuation or (e) any prepayment of principal of any LIBOR Loan is not made as a result of a withdrawn notice of prepayment pursuant to Section 5.1(a), the Borrower shall, after receipt of a written request by such Lender (which request shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for requesting such amount), pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender any amounts required to compensate such Lender for any additional losses, costs or expenses that such Lender may reasonably incur as a result of such payment, failure to convert, failure to continue or failure to prepay, including any loss, cost or expense (excluding loss of anticipated profits) actually incurred by reason of the liquidation or
 
21





 
reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by any Lender to fund or maintain such LIBOR Loan.
 
2.12                        Change of Lending Office.
 
If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.10, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 5.3, then such Lender shall, if requested by the Borrower, use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.10 or 5.3, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender.  The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
 
2.13                        Notice of Certain Costs.
 
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent any notice required by Section 2.10, 2.11 or 5.3 is given by the Administrative Agent or any Lender more than 180 days after the Administrative Agent or such Lender has knowledge (or should have had knowledge) of the occurrence of the event giving rise to the additional cost, reduction in amounts, loss, tax or other additional amounts described in such Sections (provided that no Lender shall be deemed to have knowledge of any such event referred to in Section 2.10(d) prior to the incurrence of any such additional cost, reduction in amounts, loss, tax or other additional amounts), then the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall not be entitled to compensation under Section 2.10, 2.11 or 5.3, as the case may be, for any such amounts incurred or accruing prior to the giving of such notice.
 
2.14                        Defaulting Lenders.

(a)                                 The Borrower shall have the right to prepay any Borrowing, without premium or penalty, in whole or in part at any time and from time to time. Such prepayment of Loans shall be subject to the following conditions: (i) the Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent written notice substantially in the form of Exhibit C (or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing) of its intent to make such prepayment, the amount of such prepayment and (in the case of LIBOR Loans) the specific Borrowing(s) to be prepaid, which notice shall be given by the Borrower no later than 10:00 a.m. (New York time) three Business Days prior to the date of such prepayment and shall promptly be transmitted by the Administrative Agent to each of the Lenders; (ii) each partial prepayment of Loans shall be in an amount that is a multiple of $100,000 and in an aggregate principal amount of at least $5,000,000; provided that no partial prepayment of LIBOR Loans made pursuant to a single Borrowing shall reduce the outstanding LIBOR Loans made pursuant to such Borrowing to an amount less than the Minimum Borrowing Amount for LIBOR Loans; and (iii) any prepayment of LIBOR Loans pursuant to this Section 5.1(a) on any day other than the last day of a LIBOR Period applicable thereto shall be subject to compliance by the Borrower with the applicable provisions of Section 2.11. Each prepayment of a Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing.

Such payments shall be made in immediately available funds at the office of the Administrative Agent from time to time notified by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower (but initially the office set forth for the Administrative Agent in Section 12.2(a)(ii)), it being understood that written or facsimile notice by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent to make a payment from the funds in its account at an office of the Administrative Agent shall constitute the making of such payment to the extent of such funds held in such account. The Administrative Agent will thereafter cause to be distributed on the
 
23





 
same day (if payment was actually received by the Administrative Agent prior to 2:00 p.m. (New York time) on such day, otherwise the next Business Day) like funds relating to the payment of principal or interest ratably to the Lenders entitled thereto. A payment shall be deemed to have been made by the Administrative Agent on the date on which it is required to be made under this Agreement if the Administrative Agent has, on or before such date, taken steps to make such payment in accordance with the regulations or operating procedures of the clearing or settlement system used by the Administrative Agent in order to make such payment.
 
(b)                                 Any payments under this Agreement that are made later than 12:00 Noon (New York time) shall be deemed to have been made on the next succeeding Business Day. Whenever any payment to be made hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the due date thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and, with respect to payments of principal, interest shall be payable during such extension at the applicable rate in effect immediately prior to such extension.
 
5.3                               Net Payments.
 
(a)                                 All payments made by the Borrower under this Agreement shall be made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for or on account of, any current or future income or other taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or withholdings, now or hereafter imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by any Governmental Authority, excluding (i) any net income taxes and franchise taxes (imposed in lieu of net income taxes) imposed on the Administrative Agent or any Lender, (ii) any such taxes attributable to the failure of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to comply with Section 5.3(c) and (iii) any such taxes imposed on the Administrative Agent or any Lender as a result of a current or former connection between the Administrative Agent or such Lender and the jurisdiction of the Governmental Authority imposing such tax or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein (other than any such connection arising solely from the Administrative Agent or such Lender having executed, delivered or performed its obligations or received a payment under, or enforced, this Agreement) (Taxes) except to the extent that such deduction or withholding is required by any applicable law, as modified by the administrative practice of any relevant Governmental Authority then in effect. If any such Taxes are required to be withheld from any amounts payable to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder, the Borrower shall:
 
(A)                               promptly notify the Administrative Agent of such requirement;
 
(B)                               promptly pay to the relevant Governmental Authority when due the full amount required to be deducted or withheld (including the full amount of Taxes required to be deducted or withheld from any additional amount paid by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent or such Lender under this Section 5.3(a);
 
(C)                               as promptly as possible thereafter, forward to the Administrative Agent and such Lender an official receipt (or a certified copy), or other documentation reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and such Lender, evidencing such payment to such Governmental Authority; and
 
24





 
(D)                               pay to the Administrative Agent or such Lender, in addition to the payment to which the Administrative Agent or such Lender is otherwise entitled under this Agreement, such additional amount as is necessary to ensure that the net amount actually received by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, after deduction or withholding for any such Taxes, will equal the full amount the Administrative Agent or such Lender would have received had no such deduction or withholding been required.
 
If the Borrower fails to pay to the relevant Governmental Authority when due any Taxes that it was required to deduct or withhold under this Section 5.3(a) in respect of any payment to or for the benefit of the Administrative Agent or any Lender under this Agreement or fails to furnish the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as applicable, with the documentation referred to in this Section 5.3(a) when required to do so, the Borrower shall forthwith on demand fully indemnify the Administrative Agent or such Lender for any incremental taxes, interest, costs or penalties that may become payable by the Administrative Agent or such Lender as a result of such failure.
 
The Borrowers obligations under this Section 5.3(a) shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.
 
(b)                                 Notwithstanding Section 5.3(a), the Borrower shall not be required to indemnify or pay any additional amounts in respect of withholding tax applicable to any amount payable under this Agreement pursuant to Section 5.3(a) above to any Non-U.S. Lender, except if any such Loans were assigned, participated or transferred to such Non-U.S. Lender at the request or with the consent of the Borrower or were assigned, participated or transferred to such Non-U.S. Lender following the occurrence of and during the continuance of an Event of Default pursuant to Section 10.1 or 10.5. The Borrower shall not be required to indemnify or pay any additional amounts in respect of any U.S. federal withholding Taxes imposed under FATCA.
 
(c)                                  Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of Tax with respect to payments made under this Agreement shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding.  In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 5.3(c)(i) and (c)(ii) below) shall not be required if in the Persons reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Person to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Person. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing:
 
(i)                                     The Administrative Agent and each Lender that is a United States person, as defined under Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code, shall deliver to the Borrower 
 
25





 
and, as the case may be, the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Person becomes a party under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 certifying that such Person is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax;
 
(ii)                                  Each Non-U.S. Lender shall:
 
(A)                               deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent two copies of either (x) in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender claiming exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code with respect to payments of portfolio interest, United States Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN, (together with a certificate representing that such Non-U.S. Lender is not a bank for purposes of Section 881(c) of the Code, is not a 10-percent shareholder (within the meaning of Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the Code) of the Borrower and is not a controlled foreign corporation related to the Borrower (within the meaning of Section 864(d)(4) of the Code)), or (y) Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI, in each case properly completed and duly executed by such Non-U.S. Lender claiming complete exemption from, or reduced rate of, U.S. Federal withholding tax on payments by the Borrower under this Agreement;
 
(B)                               to the extent such Non-U.S. Lender is not the beneficial owner, deliver executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8IMY, accompanied by Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI, W-8BEN, W-9, a certificate described in clause (A), and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Non-U.S. Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Non-U.S. Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Non-U.S. Lender may provide the certificate described in clause (A) on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner;
 
Each Lender and the Administrative Agent agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and, as the case may be, the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so. Each Person that shall become a Participant pursuant to Section 12.6 or a Lender pursuant to Section 12.6 shall, upon the effectiveness of the related transfer, be required to provide all the forms and statements required pursuant to this Section 5.3(c), provided that in the case of a Participant such Participant shall furnish all such required forms and statements to the Lender from which the related participation shall have been purchased.
 
(d)                                 If the Borrower determines in good faith that a reasonable basis exists for contesting any Taxes for which indemnification has been demanded hereunder, the relevant Lender or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, shall cooperate with the Borrower in challenging such Taxes at the Borrowers expense if so requested by the Borrower. If any Lender or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, receives a refund of, or credit for, a Tax for which a
 
26





 
payment has been made by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement, which refund or credit in the good faith judgment of such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, is attributable to such payment made by the Borrower, then the Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, shall reimburse the Borrower for such amount as the Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, determines to be the proportion of the refund or credit as will leave it, after such reimbursement, in no better or worse position than it would have been in if the payment had not been required. A Lender or Administrative Agent shall claim any refund or credit that it determines is available to it, unless it concludes in its reasonable discretion that it would be adversely affected by making such a claim. Neither such Lender nor the Administrative Agent shall be obliged to disclose any information regarding its tax affairs or computations to the Borrower in connection with this paragraph (d) or any other provision of this Section 5.3.
 
(e)                                  Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent for any taxes (but, in the case of any Taxes or Other Taxes, only to the extent that the Borrower has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Taxes or Other Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so) attributable to such Lender that are paid or payable by the Administrative Agent in connection with this Agreement and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  The indemnity under this Section 5.3(e) shall be paid within ten (10) days after the Administrative Agent delivers to the applicable Lender a certificate stating the amount of taxes so paid or payable by the Administrative Agent.  Such certificate shall be conclusive of the amount so paid or payable absent manifest error.
 
(f)                                   If a payment made to a Lender under this Agreement or any related loan document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lenders obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.  Solely for purposes of this clause (f), FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
 
5.4                               Computations of Interest and Fees.
 
(a)                                 All interest and fees hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, except that interest computed by reference to the ABR at times when the ABR is based on the prime rate of the Administrative Agent shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). The applicable ABR or LIBOR rate
 
27





 
shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
 
(b)                                 All interest payments to be made under this Agreement shall be paid without allowance or deduction for deemed re-investment or otherwise, both before and after maturity and before and after default and/or judgment, if any, until payment of the amount on which such interest is accruing, and interest will accrue on overdue interest, if any.
 
(c)                                  The amount of costs and expenses required to be paid or reimbursed by the Borrower pursuant to Section 12.5 or any other provision of this Agreement shall bear interest until paid, as well after as before demand, default, maturity and judgment, at the highest rate provided for in Section 2.8(c).
 
(d)                                 If interest is not paid on the indebtedness of the Borrower to the Lenders hereunder, or any part thereof, as and when interest is due and payable hereunder, unpaid interest shall bear interest until paid, as well after as before demand, default, maturity and judgment, at the rates provided for in Section 2.8(c).

ARTICLE 11 THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT
 
Each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent as its agent and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.
 
The bank serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and such bank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder.  The agency hereby created shall in no way impose any duties or obligations upon the Administrative Agent in its individual capacity as a Lender hereunder.
 
The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise in writing as directed by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 12.1), and (c) except as expressly set forth herein, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 12.1) or in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by a final and non-appealable judgment. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower or a Lender, and the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or in connection herewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article 6 or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.
 
To the extent required by any applicable law, the Administrative Agent may withhold from any payment to any Lender an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding Tax.  If the Internal Revenue Service or any other Governmental Authority asserts a claim that the Administrative Agent did not properly withhold Tax from amounts paid to or for the account of 
 
46





 
any Lender because the appropriate form was not delivered or was not properly executed or because such Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in circumstance which rendered the exemption from, or reduction of, withholding Tax ineffective or for any other reason, or if the Administrative Agent reasonably determines that a payment was made to a Lender pursuant to this Agreement without deduction of applicable withholding tax from such payment, such Lender shall indemnify the Administrative Agent fully for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the Administrative Agent as Tax or otherwise, including any penalties or interest and together with all expenses (including legal expenses, allocated internal costs and out-of-pocket expenses) incurred.
 
The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
 
The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.
 
Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Administrative Agent as provided in this paragraph, the Administrative Agent may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders and the Borrower. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, with the consent of the Borrower (not to be unreasonably withheld; provided that no such consent of the Borrower shall be required if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing), to appoint a successor. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent which shall be a bank with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such bank. Whether or not a successor Administrative Agent shall have been appointed, such resignation shall become effective in accordance with such retiring Administrative Agents notice. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent. The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After the Administrative Agents resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 12.5 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and
 
47





 
their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as Administrative Agent.
 
Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.
 
In case of the pendency of any proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code, and any other liquidation, conservatorship, bankruptcy, assignment for the benefit of creditors, moratorium, rearrangement, receivership, insolvency, reorganization, or similar debtor relief laws of the United States or other applicable jurisdictions from time to time in effect relative to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered by the Lenders (but not obligated) by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise:
 
(a)   to file a verified statement pursuant to rule 2019 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure that, in its sole opinion, complies with such rules disclosure requirements for entities representing more than one creditor;

(c)   to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;
 
and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due to the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.8 and 12.5.  To the extent that the payment of any such compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due to the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.8 and 12.5 out of the estate in any such proceeding, shall be denied for any reason, payment of the same shall be secured by a Lien 
 
48





 
on, and shall be paid out of, any and all distributions, dividends, money, securities and other properties that the Lenders may be entitled to receive in such proceeding whether in liquidation or under any plan of reorganization or arrangement or otherwise.
 
Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the obligations or the rights of any Lender or to authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender in any such proceeding.
 
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Sole Bookrunner and the Sole Lead Arranger  named on the cover page of this Agreement shall not have any duties or liabilities under this Agreement, except in its capacity, if any, as a Lender.

12.6        Successors and Assigns; Participations and Assignments.
 
(a)           Assignments Generally.  The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that (i) the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any attempted assignment or transfer by the Borrower without such consent shall be null and void) and (ii) no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer its rights or obligations hereunder except in accordance 
 
53





 
with this Section 12.6. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants (to the extent provided in paragraph (c) of this Section 12.6) and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.
 
(b)           Assignments by Lenders.
 
(i)            Assignments Generally. Subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(ii) below, any Lender may assign to one or more assignees (the Assignee) all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of the Loans at the time owing to it) with the prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of:
 
(A)          the Borrower (provided that the Borrower shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment unless it shall object thereto by written notice to the Administrative Agent within fifteen (15) days after having received notice thereof), provided that no consent of the Borrower shall be required for an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender, an Approved Fund or, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, any other assignee; and
 
(B)          the Administrative Agent, provided that no consent of the Administrative Agent shall be required for an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund.
 
(ii)           Certain Conditions to Assignments.  Assignments shall be subject to the following additional conditions:
 
(A)          except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lenders Loans, the amount of the Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $5,000,000 (or, if less, the aggregate principal amount of such assigning Lenders Loans) unless each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent otherwise consent, provided that no such consent of the Borrower shall be required if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing;
 
(B)          each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement;
 
(C)          the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500; and
 
54





 
(D)          the Assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire.
 
(iii)          Effectiveness of Assignments.  Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to paragraph (b)(iv) of this Section 12.6, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption the Assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto (the Assignment Effective Date) and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.10, 2.11 and 12.5). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 12.6 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section 12.6.
 
(iv)          Maintenance of Register.  The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders and principal amount (and stated interest) of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the Register). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and any Lender (but only, in the case of a Lender, at the Administrative Agents office set forth for the Administrative Agent in Section 12.2(a)(ii) and with respect to any entry relating to such Lenders Commitments or Loans), at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
 
(v)           Acceptance of Assignments by Administrative Agent.  Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignees completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section 12.6 and any written consent to such assignment required by paragraph (b) of this Section 12.6, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information contained therein in the Register; provided that if either the assigning Lender or the assignee shall have failed to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.4(b), the Administrative Agent shall have no obligation to accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information therein in the Register unless and until such payment shall have been made in full, together with all accrued interest thereon. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph.
 
55

 




 
(vi)          No Assignment to the Borrower or its Affiliates. No assignment pursuant to this Section 12.6 shall be made to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates.
 
(vii)         No Assignment to Natural Persons.  No assignment shall be made to a natural person.
 
(c)           Participations.
 
(i)            Participations Generally.  Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (a Participant) in all or a portion of such Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of the Loans owing to it); provided that (A) such Lenders obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (C) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the second sentence of Section 12.1 that affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (c)(ii) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.10 and 2.11 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 12.8 as though it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a nonfiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participants interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Agreement (the Participant Register); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register to any Person (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participants interest in any Commitments, Loans or its other obligations under this Agreement) except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Loan or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations, which disclosure shall be made by the relevant lender directly and solely to the Internal Revenue Service (unless otherwise required by the Internal Revenue Service). The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.
 
(ii)           Limitations on Rights of Participants.  A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.10 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless
 
56





 
the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrowers prior written consent. No Participant shall be entitled to any benefits under Section 5.3 unless such Participant complies with Section 5.3(c).
 
(iii)          No Participation to Natural Persons.  No participation shall be sold to a natural person.
 
(d)           Certain Pledges.  Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including without limitation any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank or any other central bank having jurisdiction over such Lender, and this Section 12.6 shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.
 
12.7        Replacements of Lenders under Certain Circumstances.
 
If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.10, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 5.3, or if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, or if any Lender is affected in the manner described in Section 2.10(a)(iii) and as a result thereof any of the actions described in such Section is required to be taken, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 12.6) all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that (i) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such assignment, (ii) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (iii) the Borrower shall have paid the Administrative Agent the assignment fee specified in Section 12.6, (iv) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts), (v) in the case of any such assignment resulting from payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.10 or a claim for compensation under Section 2.11, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments and (vi) such assignment does not conflict with applicable law.  A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.
 
12.8        Adjustments; Set-off.
 
(a)           If any Defaulting Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.4(b), 12.5(b) or 12.8(c), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion and notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, (i) apply for the benefit of the Administrative Agent or any Lender any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative
 
57





 
Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lenders obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid, and/or (ii) hold any such amounts in a segregated account as cash collateral for, and application to, any future funding obligations of such Lender under such Sections; in the case of each of (i) and (ii) above, in any order as determined by the Administrative Agent in its discretion.
 
(b)           After the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, in addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided by law, each Lender shall have the right, without prior notice to the Borrower, any such notice being expressly waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law, upon any amount becoming due and payable by the Borrower hereunder (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) to set-off and appropriate and apply against such amount any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final), in any currency, and any other credits, indebtedness or claims, in any currency, in each case whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured, at any time held or owing by such Lender or any branch or agency thereof to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent after any such set-off and application made by such Lender, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application.
 
(c)           If any Finance Party shall obtain any payment or other recovery (whether voluntary, involuntary, by application of setoff or otherwise) on account of any Credit Event (other than pursuant to the terms of Section 2.10, 2.11 or 5.3) in excess of its pro rata share of payments obtained by all Finance Parties, such Finance Party shall purchase from the other Finance Parties such participations in Credit Events made by them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Finance Party to share the excess payment or other recovery ratably (to the extent such other Finance Parties were entitled to receive a portion of such payment or recovery) with each of them; provided that if all or any portion of the excess payment or other recovery is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Finance Party, the purchase shall be rescinded and each Finance Party which has sold a participation to the purchasing Finance Party shall repay to the purchasing Finance Party the purchase price to the ratable extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to such selling Finance Partys ratable share (according to the proportion of (a) the amount of such selling Finance Partys required repayment to the purchasing Finance Party to (b) total amount so recovered from the purchasing Finance Party) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Finance Party in respect of the total amount so recovered. The Borrower agrees that any Finance Party purchasing a participation from another Finance Party pursuant to this Section 12.8 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including pursuant to clause (b) above) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Finance Party were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation. If under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law any Finance Party receives a secured claim in lieu of a setoff to which this Section 12.8 applies, such Finance Party shall, to the extent practicable, exercise its rights in respect of such secured claim in a manner consistent with the rights of the Lenders entitled under this Section 12.8 to share in the benefits of any recovery on such secured claim.
 
58





 
12.9        Marshalling; Payments Set Aside.
 
Neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall be under any obligation to marshal any assets in favor of the Borrower or any other party or against or in payment of any or all of the Borrowers obligations hereunder. To the extent that the Borrower makes a payment or payments to the Administrative Agent or Lenders (or to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of Lenders), or the Administrative Agent or Lenders enforce any security interests or exercise their rights of setoff, and such payment or payments or the proceeds of such enforcement or setoff or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside and/or required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party under any bankruptcy law, any other provincial, state or federal law, common law or any equitable cause, then, to the extent of such recovery, the obligation or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied, and all Liens, rights and remedies therefor or related thereto, shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment or payments had not been made or such enforcement or setoff had not occurred.
 
12.10      Counterparts.
 
This Agreement may be executed by one or more of the parties to this Agreement on any number of separate counterparts (including by facsimile transmission), and all of said counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same instrument. A set of the copies of this Agreement signed by all the parties shall be lodged with the Borrower and the Administrative Agent.
 
12.11      Severability.
 
Any provision of this Agreement that is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.
 
12.12      Integration.
 
This Agreement represents the agreement of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders with respect to the subject matter hereof, and there are no promises, undertakings, representations or warranties by the Administrative Agent or any Lender relative to subject matter hereof not expressly set forth or referred to herein.
 
12.13      Governing Law.
 
THIS AGREEMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK AND THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES APPLICABLE THEREIN (EXCLUDING ANY CONFLICT OF LAWS RULE OR PRINCIPLE WHICH MIGHT REFER SUCH CONSTRUCTION TO THE LAWS OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION).

(d)           agrees that nothing herein shall affect the right to effect service of process in any other manner permitted by law or shall limit the right to sue in any other jurisdiction; and
 
(e)           waives, to the maximum extent not prohibited by law, any right it may have to claim or recover in any legal action or proceeding referred to in this Section 12.14 any special, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages.
 
12.15      Acknowledgements.
 
The Borrower hereby acknowledges that:
 
(a)           it has been advised by counsel in the negotiation, execution and delivery of this Agreement;

61





 
(b)           The Borrower acknowledges that the Administrative Agent and one or more of the Lenders may treat its Loans as part of a transaction that is subject to Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4 or Section 301.6112-1, and the Administrative Agent and such Lender or Lenders, as applicable, may file such IRS forms or maintain such lists and other records as they may determine is required by such Treasury Regulations.
