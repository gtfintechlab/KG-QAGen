Date applicable to such Lender in an amount (based in respect of any Advances to be denominated in a Committed Currency by reference to the Equivalent thereof in Dollars determined on the date of delivery of the applicable Notice of Borrowing) not
to exceed such Lenders Unused Tranche B Commitment. Each Tranche B Borrowing shall be in an amount not less than the Revolving Credit Borrowing Minimum or the Revolving Credit Borrowing Multiple in excess thereof and shall consist of Tranche B
Advances of the same Type and in the same currency made on the same day by the Tranche B Lenders ratably according to their respective Tranche B Commitments. Within the limits of each Tranche B Lenders Tranche B Commitment, any Borrower may
borrow under this Section 2.01(a)(ii), prepay pursuant to Section 2.10 and reborrow under this Section 2.01(a)(ii).  (iii)
Limit on Revolving Credit Advances denominated in Swiss Francs. The aggregate principal amount of Revolving Credit Advances denominated in Swiss Francs shall not exceed the Dollar Equivalent of $500,000,000 at any time outstanding. 
(b) Letters of Credit. Any Borrower may request any Issuing Bank to issue, and such Issuing Bank may, if in its reasonable discretion it
elects to do so, on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth and in reliance upon the agreements of the other Lenders set forth in this Agreement, to issue standby letters of credit (each, a Letter of Credit) denominated in
Dollars for the account of any Borrower or its specified Subsidiaries from time to time on any Business Day during the period from the Effective Date until 30 days before the latest Termination Date applicable to any Tranche A Lender in an aggregate
Available Amount (i) for all Letters of Credit not to exceed at any time the Letter of Credit Facility at such time, (ii) for all Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank not to exceed at any time the Letter of Credit Commitment of
such Issuing Bank and (iii) for each such Letter of Credit not to exceed an amount equal to the Unused Tranche A Commitments of the Tranche A Lenders having a Termination Date no earlier than the expiration date of such Letter of Credit at such
time. No Letter of Credit shall have an expiration date (including all rights of the applicable Borrower or the beneficiary to require renewal) later than the earlier of one year after the Issuance thereof (or one year after its renewal or
extension) and 10 Business Days before the latest Termination Date applicable to any Tranche A Lender. Within the limits referred to above, the Borrowers may from time to time request the Issuance of Letters of Credit under this
Section 2.01(b). Each letter of credit listed on Schedule 2.01(b) shall be deemed to constitute a Letter of Credit issued hereunder, and each Lender that is an issuer of such a Letter of Credit shall, for purposes of Section 2.03, be
deemed to be an Issuing Bank for each such letter of credit, provided than any renewal or replacement of any such letter of credit on or after the date hereof shall be re-issued by an Issuing Bank
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.  (c) The Term Advances. Each Term Lender severally agrees, on the terms and conditions
hereinafter set forth, to make advances (each, a Term Advance) denominated in Dollars to the Company on the Effective Date in an aggregate amount not to exceed such Lenders Term Commitment. The Term Borrowings shall consist
of Term Advances of the same Type made simultaneously by the Term Lenders ratably according to their Term Commitments. Amounts borrowed under this Section 2.01(c) and repaid or prepaid may not be reborrowed.

SECTION 2.02. Making the Advances. (a) Except as otherwise provided in
Section 2.03(c), each Borrowing shall be made on notice, given not later than (x) 1:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the third Business Day prior to the date of the proposed Borrowing in the case of a Revolving Credit Borrowing or Term
Borrowing consisting of Eurocurrency Rate Advances denominated in Dollars, (y) 1:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the fourth Business Day prior to the date of the proposed Borrowing in the case of a Revolving Credit Borrowing consisting of
Eurocurrency Rate Advances denominated in any Committed Currency, or (z) 1:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the date of the proposed Borrowing in the case of a Revolving Credit Borrowing or Term Borrowing consisting of Base Rate Advances, by any
Borrower to the Agent, which shall give to each Appropriate Lender prompt notice thereof by telecopier, email or other electronic transmission. Each such notice of a Borrowing (a Notice of Borrowing) shall be by telecopier, email
or other electronic transmission in substantially the form of Exhibit B hereto, specifying therein the requested (i) date of such Borrowing, (ii) Type of Advances comprising such Borrowing, (iii) aggregate amount of such
Borrowing, (iv) in the case of a Borrowing consisting of Eurocurrency Rate Advances, initial Interest Period and (v) in the case of a Revolving Credit Borrowing consisting of Eurocurrency Rate Advances, currency for each such Advance. Each
Appropriate Lender shall, before 2:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the date of such Borrowing, in the case of a Borrowing consisting of Advances denominated in Dollars, and before 11:00 A.M. (London time) on the date of such
Borrowing, in the case of a Revolving Credit Borrowing consisting of Eurocurrency Rate Advances denominated in any Committed Currency, make available for the account of its Applicable Lending Office to the Agent at the applicable Agents
Account, in same day funds, such Lenders ratable portion of such Borrowing. After the Agents receipt of such funds and upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in Article III, the Agent will make such funds available
to the Borrower requesting the Borrowing at the account specified in the wiring instructions in the applicable Notice of Borrowing or, if no account is so specified, at the Agents address referred to in Section 9.02. 
(b) Anything in subsection (a) above to the contrary notwithstanding, (i) the Borrowers may not select Eurocurrency Rate Advances for
any Revolving Credit Borrowing if the aggregate amount of such Revolving Credit Borrowing is less than the Revolving Credit Borrowing Minimum or if the obligation of the Lenders to make Eurocurrency Rate Advances shall then be suspended pursuant to
Section 2.08 or 2.12, (ii) the Company may not select Eurocurrency Rate Advances for any Term Borrowing if the aggregate amount of such Term Borrowing is less than $5,000,000 or if the obligation of the Lenders to make Eurocurrency Rate
Advances shall then be suspended pursuant to Section 2.08 or 2.12 and (iii) the Eurocurrency Rate Advances may not be outstanding as part of more than 10 separate Tranche A Borrowings, more than 10 separate Tranche B Borrowings or more
than six separate Term Borrowings.  (c) Each Notice of Borrowing shall be irrevocable and binding on the Borrower requesting the Borrowing.
In the case of any Borrowing that the related Notice of Borrowing specifies is to be comprised of Eurocurrency Rate Advances, such Borrower shall indemnify each Appropriate Lender against any loss, cost or expense incurred by such Lender as a result
of any failure to fulfill on or before the date specified in such Notice of Borrowing for such Borrowing the applicable conditions set forth in Article III, including, without limitation, any loss (excluding loss of anticipated profits), cost
or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Lender to fund the Advance to be made by such Lender as part of such Borrowing when such Advance, as a result of such failure, is not made
on such date.  (d) Unless the Agent shall have received notice from an Appropriate Lender prior to the time of any Borrowing under a
Facility under which such Lender has a Commitment that such Lender will not make available to the Agent such Lenders ratable portion of such Borrowing, the Agent may assume that such Lender has made such portion available to the Agent on the
date of such Borrowing in accordance with subsection (a) of this Section 2.02, as applicable, and the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower requesting the Borrowing on such date a corresponding amount.
If and to the extent that such Lender shall not have so made such ratable portion available to the Agent, such Lender and such Borrower severally agree to repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with interest
thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to such Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Agent, at (i) in the case of such Borrower, the higher of (A) the interest rate applicable at the time to the
Advances comprising such Borrowing and (B) the cost of funds incurred by the Agent in respect of such amount and (ii) in the case of such Lender, provided that the Agent has given notice to the applicable Borrower of such obligation as
soon as practicable but in any event not later than the Business Day following such funding by the Agent, (A) the Federal Funds Rate in the case of Advances denominated in Dollars or (B) the cost of funds incurred by the Agent in respect
of such amount in the case of Advances denominated in Committed Currencies. If such Lender shall repay to the Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so repaid shall constitute such Lenders Advance as part of such Borrowing for purposes
of this Agreement.

(e) The failure of any Lender to make the Advance to be made by it as part of any Borrowing
shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Advance on the date of such Borrowing, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the Advance to be made by such other Lender on
the date of any Borrowing.  SECTION 2.03. Issuance of and Drawings and Reimbursement Under Letters of Credit. (a) Request
for Issuance. (i) Each Letter of Credit shall be issued upon notice, given not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day prior to the date of the proposed Issuance of such Letter of Credit (or on such
shorter notice as the applicable Issuing Bank may agree), by any Borrower to any Issuing Bank, and such Issuing Bank shall give the Agent, prompt notice thereof. Each such notice by a Borrower of Issuance of a Letter of Credit (a Notice of
Issuance) shall be by telecopier, email or other electronic transmission, specifying therein the requested (A) date of such Issuance (which shall be a Business Day), (B) Available Amount of such Letter of Credit,
(C) expiration date of such Letter of Credit (which shall not be later than the earlier of (1) one year after the Issuance thereof (or one year after its renewal or extension) and (2) ten Business Days before the latest Termination
Date of Tranche A Lenders having Tranche A Commitments equal to an amount not less than the Available Amount of such Letter of Credit), (D) name and address of the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit and (E) form of such Letter of Credit,
such Letter of Credit shall be issued pursuant to such application and agreement for letter of credit as such Issuing Bank and the applicable Borrower shall agree for use in connection with such requested Letter of Credit (a Letter of
Credit Agreement). If the requested form of such Letter of Credit is acceptable to such Issuing Bank in its reasonable discretion (it being understood that any such form shall have only explicit documentary conditions to draw and shall not
include discretionary conditions), such Issuing Bank will, if in its reasonable discretion it elects to do so, and unless any Tranche A Lender gives prior notice to such Issuing Bank or the Agent that the applicable conditions of Article III would
not be satisfied at the time of such Issuance, upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in Section 3.03, make such Letter of Credit available to the applicable Borrower at its office referred to in Section 9.02 or as
otherwise agreed with such Borrower in connection with such Issuance. In the event and to the extent that the provisions of any Letter of Credit Agreement shall conflict with this Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement shall govern. 
(b) Participations. By the Issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing or decreasing the amount
thereof) and without any further action on the part of the applicable Issuing Bank or the Tranche A Lenders, such Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Tranche A Lender, and each Tranche A Lender hereby acquires from such Issuing Bank, a participation
in such Letter of Credit equal to such Tranche A Lenders Ratable Share of the Available Amount of such Letter of Credit. Each Borrower hereby agrees to each such participation. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Tranche
A Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Agent, for the account of such Issuing Bank, in same day funds, such Lenders Ratable Share of each drawing made under a Letter of Credit funded by such Issuing Bank and not
reimbursed by the applicable Borrower on the date made, or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to such Borrower for any reason, which amount will be advanced, and deemed to be a Tranche A Advance to such Borrower hereunder,
regardless of the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 3.03. Each Tranche A Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and
unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Tranche A Commitments,
and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Each Tranche A Lender further acknowledges and agrees that its participation in each Letter of Credit will be automatically adjusted to
reflect such Lenders Ratable Share of the Available Amount of such Letter of Credit at each time such Lenders Tranche A Commitment is amended pursuant to a Commitment Increase pursuant to Section 2.18, an assignment in accordance
with Section 9.07 or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement.  (c) Drawing and Reimbursement. The payment by an Issuing Bank of a
draft drawn under any Letter of Credit which is not reimbursed by the applicable Borrower on the date made shall constitute for all purposes of this Agreement the making by any such Issuing Bank of a Tranche A Advance, which shall be a Base Rate
Advance, in the amount of such draft, without regard to whether the making of such an Advance would exceed 
 








Jabil Credit Agreement

such Issuing Banks Unused Tranche A Commitment. Each Issuing Bank shall give prompt notice of each drawing under any Letter of Credit issued by it to the applicable Borrower and the Agent.
Upon written demand by such Issuing Bank, with a copy of such demand to the Agent and the applicable Borrower, each Tranche A Lender shall pay to the Agent such Lenders Ratable Share of such outstanding Tranche A Advance pursuant to
Section 2.03(b). Each Tranche A Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to make Tranche A Advances pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance
whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Tranche A Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset,
abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Promptly after receipt thereof, the Agent shall transfer such funds to such Issuing Bank. Each Tranche A Lender agrees to fund its Ratable Share of an outstanding Tranche A Advance on (i) the
Business Day on which demand therefor is made by such Issuing Bank, provided that notice of such demand is given not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on such Business Day, or (ii) the first Business Day next
succeeding such demand if notice of such demand is given after such time. If and to the extent that any Tranche A Lender shall not have so made the amount of such Tranche A Advance available to the Agent, such Tranche A Lender agrees to pay to the
Agent forthwith on demand such amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date of demand by any such Issuing Bank until the date such amount is paid to the Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate for its account or the account of such
Issuing Bank, as applicable. If such Tranche A Lender shall pay to the Agent such amount for the account of any such Issuing Bank on any Business Day, such amount so paid in respect of principal shall constitute a Tranche A Advance made by such
Lender on such Business Day for purposes of this Agreement, and the outstanding principal amount of the Tranche A Advance made by such Issuing Bank shall be reduced by such amount on such Business Day. 
(d) Letter of Credit Reports. Each Issuing Bank shall furnish (A) to the Agent (with a copy to the Company) on the last Business
Day of each month a written report summarizing Issuance and expiration dates of Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank during such month and drawings during such month under all Letters of Credit and (B) to the Agent (with a copy to the
Company) on the last Business Day of each calendar month a written report setting forth the average daily aggregate Available Amount during such calendar month of all Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank. 
(e) Failure to Make Advances. The failure of any Tranche A Lender to make the Advance to be made by it on the date specified in
Section 2.03(c) shall not relieve any other Tranche A Lender of its obligation hereunder to make its Advance on such date, but no Tranche A Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Tranche A Lender to make the Advance to be made
by such other Tranche A Lender on such date.  SECTION 2.04. Fees. (a) Facility Fee. The Company agrees to pay to the
Agent for the account of each Revolving Credit Lender a facility fee on the aggregate amount of such Lenders Revolving Credit Commitment(s) from the date hereof in the case of each Initial Lender and from the effective date specified in the
Assumption Agreement or in the Assignment and Assumption pursuant to which it became a Lender in the case of each other Revolving Credit Lender until the Termination Date applicable to such Lender at a rate per annum equal to the Applicable
Percentage in effect from time to time, payable in arrears quarterly on the last day of each March, June, September and December, commencing March 31, 2020, and on the later of the Termination Date applicable to such Lender and the date all
Advances made by such Lender are paid in full; provided that no Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive any facility fee in respect of its Revolving Credit Commitment(s) for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender
(and the Company shall not be required to pay such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender), other than a facility fee, as described above, on the aggregate principal amount of Advances funded by such
Defaulting Lender outstanding from time to time.  (b) Letter of Credit Fees. (i) Each Borrower shall pay to the Agent for the
account of each Tranche A Lender a commission on such Lenders Ratable Share of the average daily aggregate Available Amount of all Letters of Credit issued for the account of such Borrower and outstanding from time to time at a rate per annum
equal to the Applicable Margin for Eurocurrency Rate Advances under the Revolving Credit Facilities in effect from time to time during such calendar quarter, payable in arrears quarterly on the last day of each March, June, September and December,
commencing with the quarter ended March 31, 2020, and on the Termination Date applicable to such Lender; provided, that no Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive any commission in respect of Letters of Credit for any period
during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and the Borrowers shall not be required to pay such commission to that Defaulting Lender but shall pay such commission as set forth in Section 2.19); provided, further, that the
Applicable Margin shall be 2% above the Applicable Margin in effect upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default if such Borrower is required to pay default interest pursuant to Section 2.07(b).

(ii) Each Borrower shall pay to each Issuing Bank, for its own account, a
fronting fee equal to 0.125% of the Available Amount of each Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, payable in arrears quarterly on the last day of each March, June, September and December, commencing March 31, 2020, and such other
commissions, issuance fees, transfer fees and other fees and charges in connection with the Issuance or administration of each Letter of Credit as such Borrower and such Issuing Bank shall agree. 
(c) Agents Fees. The Company shall pay to the Agent for its own account such fees as may from time to time be agreed between the
Company and the Agent.  SECTION 2.05. Termination or Reduction of the Commitments. (a) Optional Ratable Termination or
Reduction. The Company shall have the right, upon at least three Business Days notice to the Agent, to terminate in whole or permanently reduce ratably in part the Unused Tranche A Commitments, the Unused Tranche B Commitments or the
Unissued Letter of Credit Commitments, provided that each partial reduction of a Facility (i) shall be in the aggregate amount of $10,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and (ii) shall be made ratably
among the Appropriate Lenders in accordance with their Commitments with respect to such Facility.  (b) Termination of Defaulting
Lender. The Company may terminate the Unused Tranche A Commitment and the Unused Tranche B Commitment of any Lender that is a Defaulting Lender (determined after giving effect to any reallocation of participations in Letters of Credit as
provided in Section 2.19) upon prior notice of not less than one Business Day to the Agent (which shall promptly notify the Lenders thereof), and in such event the provisions of Section 2.19(e) shall apply to all amounts thereafter paid by
any Borrower for the account of such Defaulting Lender under this Agreement (whether on account of principal, interest, facility fees, Letter of Credit commissions or other amounts), provided that (i) no Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing and (ii) such termination shall not be deemed to be a waiver or release of any claim any Borrower, the Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender may have against such Defaulting Lender. 
SECTION 2.06. Repayment of Advances and Letter of Credit Drawings. (a) Revolving Credit Advances. Each Borrower shall repay
to the Agent for the ratable account of each Revolving Credit Lender on the Termination Date applicable to such Lender the aggregate principal amount of the Revolving Credit Advances made to it and then outstanding. 
(b) Letter of Credit Drawings. The obligations of each Borrower under any Letter of Credit Agreement and any other agreement or
instrument relating to any Letter of Credit issued for the account of such Borrower shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, such Letter of Credit Agreement and such other
agreement or instrument under all circumstances, including, without limitation, the following circumstances (it being understood that any such payment by such Borrower is without prejudice to, and does not constitute a waiver of, any rights such
Borrower might have or might acquire as a result of the payment by any Issuing Bank of any draft or the reimbursement by such Borrower thereof, including as provided in Section 9.15): 
(i) any lack of validity or enforceability of this Agreement, any Note, any Letter of Credit Agreement, any Letter of Credit or
any other agreement or instrument relating thereto (all of the foregoing being, collectively, the L/C Related Documents); 
(ii) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the obligations of such
Borrower in respect of any L/C Related Document or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from all or any of the L/C Related Documents; 
(iii) the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or other right that such Borrower
may have at any time against any beneficiary or any transferee of a Letter of Credit (or any Persons for which any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), any Issuing Bank, the Agent, any Lender or any other Person, whether in
connection with the transactions contemplated by the L/C Related Documents or any unrelated transaction;

(iv) any statement or any other document presented under a Letter of Credit
proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; 
(v) payment by any Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or certificate that does not strictly
comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit;  (vi) any exchange, release or
non-perfection of any collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any guarantee, for all or any of the obligations of such Borrower in respect of the L/C Related
Documents; or  (vii) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing,
including, without limitation, any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, such Borrower or a guarantor. 
The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on the part of an Issuing Bank, such Issuing Bank
shall be deemed to have exercised reasonable care in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be
in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, an Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information
to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.

SECTION 2.07. Interest on Advances. (a) Scheduled Interest. Each Borrower
shall pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Advance made to it and owing to each Lender from the date of such Advance until such principal amount shall be paid in full, at the following rates per annum: 
(i) Base Rate Advances. During such periods as such Advance is a Base Rate Advance, a rate per annum equal at all times
to the sum of (x) the Base Rate in effect from time to time plus (y) the Applicable Margin in effect from time to time, payable in arrears quarterly on the last day of each March, June, September and December during such periods and
on the date such Base Rate Advance shall be Converted or paid in full.  (ii) Eurocurrency Rate Advances. During such
periods as such Advance is a Eurocurrency Rate Advance, a rate per annum equal at all times during each Interest Period for such Eurocurrency Rate Advance to the sum of (x) the Eurocurrency Rate for such Interest Period for such Eurocurrency
Rate Advance plus (y) the Applicable Margin in effect from time to time, payable in arrears on the last day of such Interest Period and, if such Interest Period has a duration of more than three months, on each day that occurs during
such Interest Period every three months from the first day of such Interest Period and on the date such Eurocurrency Rate Advance shall be Converted or paid in full. 
(b) Default Interest. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default under Section 6.01(a), the Agent may
with the consent, and upon the request, of the Required Lenders shall, require the Borrowers to pay interest (Default Interest) on (i) the unpaid principal amount of each Advance owing to each Lender, payable in arrears on
the dates referred to in clause (a)(i) or (a)(ii) above, at a rate per annum equal at all times to 2% per annum above the rate per annum required to be paid on such Advance pursuant to clause (a)(i) or (a)(ii) above and (ii) to the
fullest extent permitted by law, the amount of any interest, fee or other amount payable hereunder that is not paid when due, from the date such amount shall be due until such amount shall be paid in full, payable in arrears on the date such amount
shall be paid in full and on demand, at a rate per annum equal at all times to 2% per annum above the rate per annum required to be paid on Base Rate Advances pursuant to clause (a)(i) above; provided, however, that following
acceleration of the Advances pursuant to Section 6.01, Default Interest shall accrue and be payable hereunder whether or not previously required by the Agent. 
SECTION 2.08. Interest Rate Determination. (a) The Agent shall give prompt notice to the Company and the Appropriate Lenders of
the applicable interest rate determined by the Agent for purposes of Section 2.07(a)(i) or (ii).  (b) Subject to Section 2.21,
if, with respect to any Eurocurrency Rate Borrowing under any Facility, the Lenders owed at least 51% of the aggregate principal amount thereof notify the Agent that (i) they are unable to obtain matching deposits in the London inter-bank
market at or about 11:00 A.M. (London time) on the second Business Day before the making of a Borrowing in sufficient amounts to fund their respective Eurocurrency Rate Advances as a part of such Borrowing during its Interest Period or (ii) the
Eurocurrency Rate for any Interest Period for such Advances will not adequately reflect the cost to such Lenders of making, funding or maintaining their respective Eurocurrency Rate Advances for such Interest Period, the Agent shall forthwith so
notify the Company and the Appropriate Lenders, whereupon (A) the Borrower of such Eurocurrency Rate Advances will, on the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, (1) if such Eurocurrency Rate Advances are denominated in
Dollars, either (x) prepay such Advances or (y) Convert such Advances into Base Rate Advances and (2) if such Eurocurrency Rate Advances are denominated in any Committed Currency, either (x) prepay such Advances or
(y) exchange such Advances into an Equivalent amount of Dollars and Convert such Advances into Base Rate Advances and (B) the obligation of the Appropriate Lenders to make, or to Convert Advances into, Eurocurrency Rate Advances shall be
suspended until the Agent shall notify the Company and the Lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist.  (c) If
any Borrower shall fail to select the duration of any Interest Period for any Eurocurrency Rate Advances in accordance with the provisions contained in the definition of Interest Period in Section 1.01, the Agent will forthwith so
notify such Borrower and the Appropriate Lenders and such Advances will automatically, on the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, (i) if such Eurocurrency Rate Advances are denominated in Dollars, Convert into Base Rate
Advances and (ii) if such Eurocurrency Rate Advances are denominated in a Committed Currency, be exchanged for an Equivalent amount of Dollars and Convert into Base Rate Advances.

(d) On the date on which the aggregate unpaid principal amount of Eurocurrency Rate Advances
comprising any Revolving Credit Borrowing shall be reduced, by payment or prepayment or otherwise, to less than the Revolving Credit Borrowing Minimum, such Advances shall automatically (i) if such Eurocurrency Rate Advances are denominated in
Dollars, Convert into Base Rate Advances and (ii) if such Eurocurrency Rate Advances are denominated in a Committed Currency, be exchanged for an Equivalent amount of Dollars and Convert into Base Rate Advances. 
(e) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, (i) each Eurocurrency Rate Advance will automatically, on the
last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, (A) if such Eurocurrency Rate Advances are denominated in Dollars, be Converted into Base Rate Advances and (B) if such Eurocurrency Rate Advances are denominated in any Committed
Currency, be exchanged for an Equivalent amount of Dollars and be Converted into Base Rate Advances and (ii) the obligation of the Lenders to make, or to Convert Advances into, Eurocurrency Rate Advances shall be suspended. 
(f) Subject to Section 2.21, if the applicable Bloomberg screen is unavailable for determining the Eurocurrency Rate for any Eurocurrency
Rate Advances, and no other commercially available source providing quotations of the Eurocurrency Rate have been agreed by the Agent and the Company, 
(i) the Agent shall forthwith notify the applicable Borrower and the Appropriate Lenders that the interest rate cannot be
determined for such Eurocurrency Rate Advances,  (ii) each such Advance will automatically, on the last day of the then
existing Interest Period therefor, (A) if such Eurocurrency Rate Advance is denominated in Dollars, Convert into a Base Rate Advance and (B) if such Eurocurrency Rate Advance is denominated in any Committed Currency, be prepaid by the
applicable Borrower or be automatically exchanged for an Equivalent amount of Dollars and be Converted into a Base Rate Advance (or if such Advance is then a Base Rate Advance, will continue as a Base Rate Advance), and 
(iii) the obligation of the Appropriate Lenders to make Eurocurrency Rate Advances or to Convert Advances comprising a
Borrowing into Eurocurrency Rate Advances shall be suspended until the Agent shall notify the Company and the Appropriate Lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist. 
SECTION 2.09. Optional Conversion of Advances. The Borrower of any Advance made as a part of a Borrowing may on any Business Day, upon
notice given to the Agent not later than 1:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the third Business Day prior to the date of the proposed Conversion and subject to the provisions of Sections 2.08 and 2.12, Convert all or any portion of the
Advances made as a part of a Borrowing denominated in Dollars of one Type comprising the same Borrowing into Advances denominated in Dollars of the other Type; provided, however, that any Conversion of Eurocurrency Rate Advances into
Base Rate Advances shall be made only on the last day of an Interest Period for such Eurocurrency Rate Advances, any Conversion of Base Rate Advances into Eurocurrency Rate Advances shall be in an amount not less than the minimum amount specified in
Section 2.02(b), no Conversion of any Advances shall result in more separate Borrowings than permitted under Section 2.02(b) and each Conversion of Advances comprising part of the same Borrowing under any Facility shall be made ratably
among the Appropriate Lenders in accordance with their Commitments under such Facility. Each such notice of a Conversion shall, within the restrictions specified above, specify (i) the date of such Conversion, (ii) the Dollar denominated
Advances to be Converted, and (iii) if such Conversion is into Eurocurrency Rate Advances, the duration of the initial Interest Period for each such Advance. Each notice of Conversion shall be irrevocable and binding on the Borrower giving such
notice.  SECTION 2.10. Prepayments of Advances. (a) Optional. Each Borrower may, upon notice at least two Business
Days prior to the date of such prepayment, in the case of Eurocurrency Rate Advances, and not later than 1:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the date of such prepayment, in the case of Base Rate Advances, to the Agent stating the proposed date

interest to the date of such prepayment on the principal amount prepaid; provided, however, that (i) each partial prepayment of Revolving Credit Advances shall be in an aggregate principal amount of not less than the Revolving
Credit

Borrowing Minimum or a Revolving Credit Borrowing Multiple in excess thereof, (ii) each partial prepayment of Term Advances shall be in an aggregate principal amount of not less than
$10,000,000, (iii) in the event of any such prepayment of a Eurocurrency Rate Advance, such Borrower shall be obligated to reimburse the Lenders in respect thereof pursuant to Section 9.04(c) and (iv) each partial prepayment of Term
Advances shall be applied to the payments of Term Advances and the installments thereof as the Company may direct.  (b) Mandatory.
(i) Tranche A Facility. If, on any date, the Agent notifies the Company that, on any interest payment date, the sum of (A) all Tranche A Advances denominated in Dollars plus the aggregate Available Amount of all Letters of Credit then
outstanding plus (B) the Equivalent in Dollars (determined on the third Business Day prior to such interest payment date) of the aggregate principal amount of all Tranche A Advances denominated in Committed Currencies then outstanding exceeds
103% of the aggregate Tranche A Commitments on such date, the Borrowers shall, as soon as practicable and in any event within two Business Days after receipt of such notice, prepay the outstanding principal amount of any Tranche A Advances owing by
the Borrowers in an aggregate amount sufficient to reduce such sum to an amount not to exceed 100% of the aggregate Tranche A Commitments of the Lenders on such date; provided that if the Company has cash collateralized Letters of Credit in
accordance with Section 2.19(a), for purposes of this Section 2.10(b) the Available Amount of outstanding Letters of Credit shall be deemed to have been reduced by the amount of such cash collateral. 
(ii) Tranche B Facility. If, on any date, the Agent notifies the Company that, on any interest payment date, the sum of (A) all Tranche B
Advances denominated in Dollars plus (B) the Equivalent in Dollars (determined on the third Business Day prior to such interest payment date) of the aggregate principal amount of all Tranche B Advances denominated in Committed Currencies then
outstanding exceeds 103% of the aggregate Tranche B Commitments on such date, the Borrowers shall, as soon as practicable and in any event within two Business Days after receipt of such notice, prepay the outstanding principal amount of any Tranche
B Advances owing by the Borrowers in an aggregate amount sufficient to reduce such sum to an amount not to exceed 100% of the aggregate Tranche B Commitments of the Lenders on such date. 
(iii) Swiss Francs Usage. If, on any date, the Agent notifies the Company that, on any interest payment date, the Equivalent in Dollars
(determined on the third Business Day prior to such interest payment date) of the aggregate principal amount of all Revolving Credit Advances denominated in Swiss Francs then outstanding exceeds $500,000,000, the Borrowers shall, as soon as
practicable and in any event within two Business Days after receipt of such notice, prepay the outstanding principal amount of any Revolving Credit Advances denominated in Swiss Francs owing by the Borrowers in an aggregate amount sufficient to
reduce such aggregate principal by such excess on such date.  (iv) Each prepayment made pursuant to this Section 2.10(b) shall be made
together with any interest accrued to the date of such prepayment on the principal amounts prepaid and, in the case of any prepayment of a Eurocurrency Rate Advance on a date other than the last day of an Interest Period or at its maturity, any
additional amounts which the applicable Borrower shall be obligated to reimburse to the Lenders in respect thereof pursuant to Section 9.04(c). 
(v) The Agent shall calculate on the date of each Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Issuance and on each interest payment date the sum of
(A) the aggregate principal amount of all Advances denominated in Dollars plus the aggregate Available Amount of all Letters of Credit then outstanding plus (B) the Equivalent in Dollars (determined on the third Business Day prior to such
interest payment date) of the aggregate principal amount of all Advances denominated in Committed Currencies and shall give prompt notice (and in any event no later than thirty days) of any prepayment required under this Section 2.10(b) to the
Company and the Appropriate Lenders.  SECTION 2.11. Increased Costs. (a) If, due to either (i) the introduction or phase
in of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law, rule, guideline, decision, directive, treaty or regulation or (ii) the compliance with any guideline or request from any central bank or other governmental authority including, without
limitation, any agency of the European Union or similar monetary or multinational authority (whether or not having the force of law), there shall be any increase in the cost to any Lender of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining
Eurocurrency Rate Advances or of agreeing to issue or of issuing or maintaining or participating in Letters of Credit (excluding for purposes of this Section 2.11 any such increased costs resulting from (A) Indemnified Taxes,
(B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C)

Connection Income Taxes), then the Company shall from time to time, upon demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Agent), pay to the Agent for the account of such Lender
additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender for such increased cost; provided, however, that before making any such demand, each Lender agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and
regulatory restrictions) to designate a different Applicable Lending Office if the making of such designation would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such increased cost and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, be
otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender. A certificate as to the amount of such increased cost, submitted to the Company and the Agent by such Lender, shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. 
(b) If any Lender determines that compliance with any law or regulation or any guideline or request from any central bank or other governmental
authority (whether or not having the force of law), in each case, that comes into effect after the Effective Date, affects or would affect the amount of capital or liquidity required or expected to be maintained by such Lender or any corporation
controlling such Lender and that the amount of such capital or liquidity is increased by or based upon the existence of such Lenders commitment to lend or to issue or participate in Letters of Credit hereunder and other commitments of such
type or the Issuance or maintenance of or participation in the Letters of Credit (or similar contingent obligations), then, upon demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Agent), the Company shall pay to the Agent for the account of
such Lender, from time to time as specified by such Lender, additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender or such corporation in the light of such circumstances, to the extent that such Lender reasonably determines such increase in capital
or liquidity to be allocable to the existence of such Lenders commitment to lend or to issue or participate in Letters of Credit hereunder or to the Issuance or maintenance of or participation in any Letters of Credit. A certificate as to such
amounts submitted to the Company and the Agent by such Lender shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.  (c)
Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lenders right to demand such compensation; provided that the Company shall not be required to compensate a
Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Company of the change in law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions, and of such
Lenders intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the change in law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be
extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof). Such demand for compensation shall be in reasonable detail and shall certify that the claim for additional amounts referred to therein is generally consisten

 anything herein to the contrary, for the purposes of this Section 2.11, (i) the
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and all requests, rules, regulations, guidelines, interpretations or directives by a governmental authority thereunder or issued by a governmental authority in connection therewith (whether
or not having the force of law) and (ii) all requests, rules, regulations, guidelines, interpretations or directives promulgated by the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (or any successor or similar
authority) or the United States or foreign regulatory authorities (whether or not having the force of law), in case for this clause (ii) pursuant to Basel III, shall in each case be deemed to be a change in law regardless of the date enacted,
adopted, issued, promulgated or implemented.  SECTION 2.12. Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement
(other than Section 2.21), if any Lender shall notify the Agent that the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation, in each case, after the Effective Date, makes it unlawful, or any central bank or other
governmental authority asserts that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its Eurocurrency Lending Office to perform its obligations hereunder to make Eurocurrency Rate Advances in Dollars or any Committed Currency or to fund or maintain Eurocurrency
Rate Advances in Dollars or any Committed Currency hereunder, (a) each Eurocurrency Rate Advance will automatically, upon such notification (i) if such Eurocurrency Rate Advance is denominated in Dollars, be Converted into a Base Rate
Advance and (ii) if such Eurocurrency Rate Advance is denominated in any Committed Currency, be exchanged into an Equivalent amount of Dollars and be Converted into a Base Rate Advance and (b) the obligation of the Lenders to make
Eurocurrency Rate Advances or to Convert Advances into Eurocurrency Rate Advances shall be suspended until the Agent shall notify the Company and the Lenders that the 
 








Jabil Credit Agreement

circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist; provided, however, that before making any such notification, each Lender agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with its
internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to designate a different Eurocurrency Lending Office if the making of such designation would allow such Lender or its Eurocurrency Lending Office to continue to perform its obligations to make
Eurocurrency Rate Advances or to continue to fund or maintain Eurocurrency Rate Advances and would not, in the judgment of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender. 
SECTION 2.13. Payments and Computations. (a) Each Borrower shall make each payment hereunder (except with respect to principal of,
interest on, and other amounts relating to, Advances denominated in a Committed Currency), irrespective of any right of counterclaim or set-off, not later than 1:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the
day when due in Dollars to the Agent at the applicable Agents Account in same day funds. Each Borrower shall make each payment hereunder with respect to principal of, interest on, and other amounts relating to, Advances denominated in a
Committed Currency, irrespective of any right of counterclaim or set-off, not later than 1:00 P.M. (at the Payment Office for such Committed Currency) on the day when due in such Committed Currency to the
Agent, by deposit of such funds to the applicable Agents Account in same day funds. The Agent will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like funds relating to the payment of principal or interest, fees or commissions ratably (other than
amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.03, 2.04(b), 2.11, 2.14 or 9.04(c)) to the Appropriate Lenders for the account of their respective Applicable Lending Offices, and like funds relating to the payment of any other amount payable to any
Lender to such Lender for the account of its Applicable Lending Office, in each case to be applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Upon any Assuming Lender becoming a Lender hereunder as a result of a Commitment Increase pursuant to
Section 2.18 or an extension of the Termination Date pursuant to Section 2.20, and upon the Agents receipt of such Lenders Assumption Agreement and recording of the information contained therein in the Register, from and after
the applicable Increase Date or Anniversary Date, as the case may be, the Agent shall make all payments hereunder and under any Notes issued in connection therewith in respect of the interest assumed thereby to the Assuming Lender. Upon its
acceptance of an Assignment and Assumption and recording of the information contained therein in the Register pursuant to Section 9.07(c), from and after the effective date specified in such Assignment and Assumption, the Agent shall make all
payments hereunder and under the Notes in respect of the interest assigned thereby to the Lender assignee thereunder, and the parties to such Assignment and Assumption shall make all appropriate adjustments in such payments for periods prior to such
effective date directly between themselves.  (b) All computations of interest based on Citibanks announced base rate shall be made by
the Agent on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and all computations of interest based on the Eurocurrency Rate, the Federal Funds Rate or clauses (b) and (c) of the definition of Base Rate and of fees and Letter of
Credit commissions shall be made by the Agent on the basis of a year of 360 days (or, in each case of Advances denominated in Committed Currencies where market practice differs, in accordance with market practice), in each case for the actual number
of days (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest, fees or commissions are payable. Each determination by the Agent of an interest rate hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all
purposes, absent manifest error.  (c) Whenever any payment hereunder or under the Notes shall be stated to be due on a day other than a
Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest, fee or commission, as the case may be; provided,
however, that, if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of Eurocurrency Rate Advances to be made in the next following calendar month, such payment shall be made on the next preceding Business Day. 
(d) Unless the Agent shall have received notice from any Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Appropriate Lenders
hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment in full to the Agent on such date and the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each
Appropriate Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender. If and to the extent such Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the Agent, each Lender shall repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such amount
distributed to such Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to the Agent, at (i) the Federal Funds Rate in the case of Advances
denominated in Dollars or (ii) the cost of funds incurred by the Agent in respect of such amount in the case of Advances denominated in Committed Currencies.

(e) To the extent that the Agent receives funds for application to the amounts owing by any
Borrower under or in respect of this Agreement or any Note in currencies other than the currency or currencies required to enable the Agent to distribute funds to the Lenders in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.13, the Agent shall be
entitled to convert or exchange such funds into Dollars or into a Committed Currency or from Dollars to a Committed Currency or from a Committed Currency to Dollars, as the case may be, to the extent necessary to enable the Agent to distribute such
funds in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.13; provided that each Borrower and each of the Appropriate Lenders hereby agree that the Agent shall not be liable or responsible for any loss, cost or expense suffered by such
Borrower or such Lender as a result of any conversion or exchange of currencies affected pursuant to this Section 2.13(e) or as a result of the failure of the Agent to effect any such conversion or exchange; and provided further that the
Borrowers agree to indemnify the Agent and each Lender, and hold the Agent and each Lender harmless, for any and all losses, costs and expenses incurred by the Agent or any Lender for any conversion or exchange of currencies (or the failure to
convert or exchange any currencies) in accordance with this Section 2.13(e), absent gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on the part of the Agent or such Lender, respectively. 
SECTION 2.14. Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any Borrower to or for the account of any Lender or the Agent
hereunder or under the Notes shall be made, in accordance with Section 2.13 or the applicable provisions of such other documents, free and clear of and without deduction for any Taxes, except as required by applicable
law.    If any Withholding Agent shall be required by law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable Withholding Agent) to deduct or withhold any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder or under
any Note to any Lender or the Agent, (i) the applicable Withholding Agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant governmental authority in accordance
with applicable law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by such Borrower shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to
additional sums payable under this Section 2.14), such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made. 
(b) In addition, the Company shall pay any present or future stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or
similar levies that arise from any payment made hereunder or under the Notes hereunder or from the execution, delivery or registration of, performing under, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement or the Notes, except any such Taxes that are
Other Connection Taxes imposed with respect to an assignment (other than an assignment made pursuant to Section 9.18) (hereinafter referred to as Other Taxes). 
(c) Each Borrower shall (without duplication) indemnify each Lender and the Agent for and hold it harmless against the full amount of Taxes or
Other Taxes (including, without limitation, Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on amounts payable under this Section 2.14) imposed on or paid by such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or
with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant governmental authority other than such liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) attributable to the acts
of or failure to act by such Lender. This indemnification shall be made within 10 days from the date such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) makes written demand therefor. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered
to the Company by a Lender (with a copy to the Agent), or by the Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
(d) Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to
such Lender (but only to the extent that the Borrowers have not already indemnified the Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Borrowers to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lenders failure to
comply with the provisions of Section 9.07(d) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Agent in connection herewith, and
any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant governmental authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered
to any Lender by the Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender hereunder or otherwise payable by the Agent to the Lender from
any other source against any amount due to the Agent under this paragraph (d).

(e) Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes to a governmental authority
pursuant to this Section 2.14, each Borrower shall furnish to the Agent, at its address referred to in Section 9.02, the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing such payment to the extent such a receipt is issued therefor, or
other written proof of payment thereof that is reasonably satisfactory to the Agent.  (f) (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an
exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under this Agreement or the Notes shall deliver to the Borrowers and the Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by a Borrower or the Agent, such properly
completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by a Borrower or the Agent in writing as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by a
Borrower or the Agent in writing, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by a Borrower or the Agent as will enable such Borrower or the Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to
backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in
paragraphs (e)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) of this Section) shall not be required if in the Lenders reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or
expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.  (ii) Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, in the event that a Borrower is a U.S. Borrower,  (A) any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the
Borrowers and the Agent on or about the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of a Borrower or the Agent), executed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax; 
(B) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrowers and the Agent (in such
number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or about the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Company or the Agent), whichever of
the following is applicable:  (1) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which
the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under this Agreement, the Notes, or any other documents to be delivered hereunder, executed copies of Internal Revenue Service
Form W-8BEN or Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of,
U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the interest article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under this Agreement, the Notes, or any other documents to be delivered hereunder, Internal
Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of,
U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the business profits or other income article of such tax treaty; 
(2) executed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI; 
(3) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of
the Internal Revenue Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit E-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a bank within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A)
of the Internal Revenue Code, a 10 percent shareholder of such Borrower within the meaning of Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code, or a controlled foreign corporation related to such Borrower as
described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code (a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate) and (y) executed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or Internal
Revenue Service Form W-8BEN-E; or

(4) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed
copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8IMY, accompanied by Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI, Internal Revenue Service
Form W-8BEN, Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN-E, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit E-2 or Exhibit E-3, Internal Revenue Service Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial
owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax
Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit E-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner; 
(C) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrowers and the Agent (in such
number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or about the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrowers or the Agent), executed
copies of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law
to permit the Borrowers or the Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and  (D) If a payment
made to a Lender hereunder would be subject to United States federal withholding tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or
1472(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Company and the Agent, at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Company or the Agent, such documentation
prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Internal Revenue Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Company or the Agent as may be necessary for the Company or the Agent
to comply with its obligations under FATCA, to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lenders obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (D),
FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.  Each Lender agrees that if any form or
certification it previously delivered in relation to this Section 2.14 expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrowers and the Agent in writing of its legal
inability to do so  (g) If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes
as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity
payments made under this Section with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified party and
without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant governmental authority with respect to such refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over
pursuant to this paragraph (g) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant governmental authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required

net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the
indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes
that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.  SECTION 2.15. Sharing of Payments, Etc. If any Lender
shall obtain any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise) on account of the Advances owing to it (other than (x) as payment of an Advance made
by an Issuing Bank pursuant to the first sentence of Section 2.03(c) or (y) pursuant to Section 2.06, 2.11, 2.14, 2.19 or 9.04(c)) in excess of its pro rata share of payments on account of the Advances obtained by all the Lenders,
such Lender shall forthwith purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the Advances owing to them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share 
 








Jabil Credit Agreement

the excess payment ratably with each of them; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, such purchase
from each Lender shall be rescinded and such Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price to the extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to such Lenders ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the
amount of such Lenders required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered;
provided further that, so long as the maturity of the obligations under this Agreement and the Notes shall not have been accelerated, any excess payment received by any Appropriate Lender in respect of any Facility shall be shared on a
pro rata basis only with other Appropriate Lenders. Each Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section 2.15 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of
payment (including the right of set-off) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation.

evidencing the indebtedness of each Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Advance owing to such Lender from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder in respect of
Advances. Each Borrower agrees that upon notice by any Lender to such Borrower (with a copy of such notice to the Agent) to the effect that a Note is required or appropriate in order for such Lender to evidence (whether for purposes of pledge,
enforcement or otherwise) the Advances owing to, or to be made by, such Lender, such Borrower shall promptly execute and deliver to such Lender a Revolving Credit Note and a Term Note, as applicable, in substantially the form of Exhibits A-1 and A-2 hereto, respectively, payable to the order of such Lender in a principal amount equal to the Revolving Credit Commitment(s) and the Term Commitment, respectively,
of such Lender.  (b) The Register maintained by the Agent pursuant to Section 9.07(c) shall include a control account, and a
subsidiary account for each Lender, in which accounts (taken together) shall be recorded (i) the date and amount of each Borrowing made hereunder, the Type of Advances comprising such Borrowing and, if appropriate, the Interest Period
applicable thereto, (ii) the terms of each Assumption Agreement and each Assignment and Assumption delivered to and accepted by it, (iii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from each

(c) Entries made in good faith by the Agent in the Register pursuant to subsection (b) above, and by each Lender in its account or
accounts pursuant to subsection (a) above, shall be prima facie evidence of the amount of principal and interest due and payable or to become due and payable from each Borrower to, in the case of the Register, each Lender and, in
the case of such account or accounts, such Lender, under this Agreement, absent manifest error; provided, however, that the failure of the Agent or such Lender to make an entry, or any finding that an entry is incorrect, in the
Register or such account or accounts shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of any Borrower under this Agreement.  SECTION

SECTION 2.18. Increase in the Aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments. (a) The Company may, at any time but in any event not more

amount of $50,000,000 or an integral multiple thereof (each a Commitment Increase) to be effective as of a date that is at least 90 days prior to the latest scheduled Termination Date with respect to such Revolving Credit Facility
(the Increase Date) as specified in the related notice to the Agent; provided, however that (i) in no event shall the aggregate amount of the Commitment Increases at any time exceed $1,000,000,000 and

identified by the Company of the request by the Company for a Commitment Increase, which notice shall include (i) the proposed amount and Revolving Credit Facility of such requested Commitment Increase, (ii) the proposed Increase Date and

or (y) in the case of an Eligible Assignee, to assume an applicable Revolving Credit Commitment hereunder (the Commitment Date). Each Lender and Eligible Assignee that is willing to participate in such requested Commitment
Increase (each an Increasing Lender) shall, in its sole discretion, give written notice to the Agent on or prior to the Commitment Date of the amount by which it is willing to participate in such increase; provided,
however, that the applicable Revolving Credit Commitment of each such Eligible Assignee shall be in an amount of $10,000,000 or more. If the Lenders and such Eligible Assignees notify the Agent that they are willing to participate in such
increase by an aggregate amount that exceeds the amount of the requested Commitment Increase, the requested Commitment Increase shall be allocated among the Lenders willing to participate therein and such Eligible Assignees in such amounts as are
agreed between the Company and the Agent. Each Lenders and each Eligible Assignees proposed increased Tranche A Commitment shall be subject to the prior written approval of each Issuing Bank.

applicable Revolving Credit Commitment of each Increasing Lender for such requested Commitment Increase shall be so increased by such amount (or by the amount allocated to such Lender pursuant to Section 2.18(b)) as of such Increase Date;
provided, however, that the Agent shall have received on or before such Increase Date the following, each dated such date: 
(i) (A) certified copies of resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company or the Executive Committee of such Board
approving the Commitment Increase and the corresponding modifications to this Agreement and (B) an opinion of counsel for the Company (which may be in-house counsel), in form and substance satisfactory to

Company and the Agent (each an Assumption Agreement), duly executed by such Eligible Assignee, the Agent and the Company; and 
(iii) confirmation from each Increasing Lender of the increase in the amount of its applicable Revolving Credit Commitment in a
writing satisfactory to the Company and the Agent.  On each Increase Date, upon fulfillment of the conditions set forth in the immediately preceding
sentence of this Section 2.18(d), the Agent shall notify the Lenders (including, without limitation, each Assuming Lender) and the Company, on or before 1:00 P.M. (New York City time), by telecopier, of the occurrence of the Commitment Increase
to be effected on such Increase Date and shall record in the Register the relevant information with respect to each Increasing Lender and each Assuming Lender on such date. Each Increasing Lender and each Assuming Lender shall, before 2:00 P.M. (New
York City time) on the Increase Date, purchase at par that portion of outstanding applicable Revolving Credit Advances of the other applicable Revolving Credit Lenders or take such other actions as the Agent may determine to be necessary to cause
the applicable Revolving Credit Advances to be held pro rata by the Appropriate Lenders in accordance with the Commitments with respect to the applicable Revolving Credit Facility.

Section 2.19. Defaulting Lenders. (a) If any Letters of Credit are
outstanding at the time a Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, and the Tranche A Commitments have not been terminated in accordance with Section 6.01, then: 
(i) so long as no Default has occurred and is continuing, all or any part of the Available Amount of outstanding Letters of
Credit shall be reallocated among the Tranche A Lenders that are not Defaulting Lenders (non-Defaulting Lenders) in accordance with their respective Ratable Shares (disregarding any
Defaulting Lenders Tranche A Commitment) but only to the extent that (x) the sum of (A) the aggregate principal amount of all Tranche A Advances made by such non-Defaulting Lenders (in their
capacity as Tranche A Lenders) and outstanding at such time, plus (B) such non-Defaulting Lenders Ratable Shares (before giving effect to the reallocation contemplated herein) of the Available
Amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit, plus (C) the aggregate principal amount of all Tranche A Advances made by each Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.03(c) that have not been ratably funded by Lenders and outstanding at such time,
plus (D) such Defaulting Lenders Ratable Share of the Available Amount of such Letters of Credit, does not exceed the total of all non-Defaulting Lenders Tranche A Commitments and (y) the
sum of (A) the aggregate principal amount of all Tranche A Advances made by any non-Defaulting Lender (in its capacity as a Tranche A Lender) and outstanding at such time, plus (B) such non-Defaulting Lenders participation interest (after giving effect to the reallocation contemplated herein) in the Available Amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit and Tranche A Advances made by each
Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.03(c) that have not been ratably funded by Lenders, does not exceed such non-Defaulting Lenders Tranche A Commitment; subject to Section 9.20, no reallocation
hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a
non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such non-Defaulting Lenders increased exposure following such reallocation; 
(ii) if the reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the applicable Borrower
shall within two Business Days following notice by any Issuing Bank, cash collateralize such Defaulting Lenders Ratable Share of the Available Amount of such Letters of Credit (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause
(i) above), by paying cash collateral in such amount to such Issuing Bank; provided that, so long as no Default shall be continuing, such cash collateral shall be released promptly upon the earliest of (A) the reallocation of the
Available Amount of outstanding Letters of Credit among non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with clause (i) above, (B) the termination of the Defaulting Lender status of the applicable Lender or
(C) such Issuing Banks good faith determination that there exists excess cash collateral (in which case, the amount equal to such excess cash collateral shall be released); 
(iii) if the Ratable Shares of Letters of Credit of the non-Defaulting Lenders are
reallocated or cash collateralized pursuant to this Section 2.19(a), then the fees payable to the Tranche A Lenders pursuant to Section 2.04(b)(i) shall be adjusted in accordance with such
non-Defaulting Lenders Ratable Shares of the Letters of Credit that are not cash collateralized; or 
(iv) if any Defaulting Lenders Ratable Share of Letters of Credit is neither cash collateralized nor reallocated pursuant
to Section 2.19(a), then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of any Issuing Bank or any Lender hereunder, all letter of credit fees payable under Section 2.04(b)(i) with respect to such Defaulting Lenders Ratable Share of
Letters of Credit shall be payable to the applicable Issuing Bank until such Defaulting Lenders Ratable Share of Letters of Credit is cash collateralized and/or reallocated. 
(b) So long as any Tranche A Lender is a Defaulting Lender, no Issuing Bank shall be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit
unless it is satisfied that the related exposure will be 100% covered by the Tranche A Commitments of the non-Defaulting Lenders and/or cash collateral will be provided by the Borrowers in accordance with
Section 2.19(a), and participating interests in any such newly issued or increased Letter of Credit shall be allocated among non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent with Section 2.19(a)(i) (and
Defaulting Lenders shall not participate therein).  (c) No Revolving Credit Commitment of any Lender shall be increased or otherwise
affected, and, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Section 2.19, performance by any Borrower of its obligations shall not be excused or otherwise modified as a result of the operation of this Section 2.19. The rights and
remedies against a Defaulting Lender under this Section 2.19 are in addition to any other rights and remedies which any Borrower, the Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender may have against such Defaulting Lender.

(d) If each Borrower, the Agent and each Issuing Bank agree in writing in their reasonable
determination that a Defaulting Lender should no longer be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender, the Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein
(which may include arrangements with respect to any cash collateral), that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase that portion of outstanding Advances under a Revolving Credit Facility of the other Appropriate Lenders or take such other
actions as the Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the applicable Revolving Credit Advances and, in the case of the Tranche A Facility, funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit to be held on a pro rata basis by the
Appropriate Lenders in accordance with their Ratable Share (without giving effect to Section 2.19(a)), whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to
fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrowers while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from
Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from such Lenders having been a Defaulting Lender. 
(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any payment of principal, interest, fees, Letter of Credit
commissions or other amounts received by the Agent for the account of any Defaulting Lender under this Agreement (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Article VI or otherwise) shall be applied at such time or times as may be
determined by the Agent as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Agent hereunder; second, in the case of a Defaulting Lender that is a Tranche A Lender, to the payment on a pro rata basis
of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to any Issuing Bank hereunder; third, in the case of a Defaulting Lender that is a Tranche A Lender, if so determined by the Agent or requested by any Issuing Bank, to be held as cash collateral
for future funding obligations of such Defaulting Lender in respect of any participation in any Letter of Credit; fourth, as the Borrowers may request (so long as no Default exists), to the funding of any Advance in respect of which that
Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Agent; fifth, in the case of a Defaulting Lender that is a Revolving Credit Lender, if so determined by the Agent and the Borrowers,
to be held in the L/C Cash Deposit Account and released in order to satisfy obligations of such Defaulting Lender to fund Revolving Credit Advances under this Agreement; sixth, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders or the Issuing
Banks as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender or Issuing Bank against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement; seventh,
so long as no Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to any Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by such Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lenders
breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and eighth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any
Advance in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share, and (y) such Advances were made or the related Letters of Credit were issued at a time when the applicable conditions set forth in Article III were
satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Advances of all Non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Advances of such Defaulting Lender
and provided further that any amounts held as cash collateral for funding obligations of a Defaulting Lender shall be returned to such Defaulting Lender upon the termination of this Agreement and the satisfaction of such Defaulting Lenders
obligations hereunder. Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post cash collateral pursuant to this Section 2.19 shall be
deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.  SECTION 2.20. Extensions of
Termination Date. (a) Requests for Extension. The Company may, by notice to the Agent (who shall promptly notify the applicable Revolving Credit Lenders) not earlier than 60 days and not later than 35 days prior to the first, second

Termination Date then in effect with respect to such Lender.  (b) Lender Elections to Extend. Each Appropriate Lender, acting in its
sole and individual discretion, shall, by notice to the Agent given no later than the date (the Notice Date) that is 20 days prior to such Anniversary Date, advise the Agent whether or not such Lender agrees to such extension (and
each Appropriate Lender that determines not to so extend its Termination Date (a Non-Extending Lender) shall notify the Agent of such fact promptly after such determination (but in any event
no later than the Notice Date) and any Appropriate Lender that does not so advise the Agent on or before the Notice Date shall be deemed to be a Non-Extending Lender). The election of any Appropriate Lender to

agreed so to extend their Termination Date and the additional Revolving Credit Commitments of the Assuming Lenders shall be more than 50% of the aggregate amount of the Revolving Credit Commitments in respect of the applicable Facility in effect
immediately prior to the applicable Anniversary Date, then, effective as of such Anniversary Date, the Termination Date of each extending Appropriate Lender and of each Assuming Lender shall be extended to the date falling one year after the
Termination Date in effect for such Appropriate Lenders (except that, if such date is not a Business Day, such Termination Date as so extended shall be the next preceding Business Day) and each Assuming Lender shall thereupon become a Tranche
A Lender or Tranche B Lender, as applicable, for all purposes of this Agreement.  SECTION 2.21. LIBOR Successor

aggregate Available Amount over (b) the total amount of funds, if any, then held in the L/C Cash Deposit Account that the Agent determines to be free and clear of any such right and claim. Upon the drawing of any Letter of Credit, to the extent
funds are on deposit in the L/C Cash Deposit Account, such funds shall be applied to reimburse the Issuing Banks to the extent permitted by applicable law. After all such Letters of Credit shall have expired or been fully drawn upon and all other
obligations of the Borrowers hereunder and under the Notes shall have been paid in full, the balance, if any, in such L/C Cash Deposit Account shall be returned to the Borrowers.

ARTICLE VII 
GUARANTY  SECTION 7.01.
Unconditional Guaranty. The Company hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees the punctual payment when due, whether at scheduled maturity or on any date of a required prepayment or by acceleration, demand or otherwise, of
all obligations of each other Borrower now or hereafter existing under or in respect of this Agreement and the Notes (including, without limitation, any extensions, modifications, substitutions, amendments or renewals of any or all of the foregoing
obligations), whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, and whether for principal, interest, premiums, fees, indemnities, contract causes of action, costs, expenses or otherwise (such obligations being the Guaranteed
Obligations), and agrees to pay any and all expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable, documented and invoiced fees and expenses of counsel) incurred by the Agent or any Lender in enforcing any rights under this Agreement.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Companys liability shall extend to all amounts that constitute part of the Guaranteed Obligations and would be owed by such Borrower to the Agent or any Lender under or in respect of this
Agreement and the Notes but for the fact that they are unenforceable or not allowable due to the existence of a bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding involving such Borrower. 
SECTION 7.02. Guaranty Absolute. (a) The Company guarantees that the Guaranteed Obligations will be paid strictly in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement and the Notes, regardless of any law, regulation or order now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction affecting any of such terms or the rights of the Agent or any Lender with respect thereto. The obligations of
the Company under or in respect of this Guaranty are independent of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other obligations of any other Borrower under or in respect of this Agreement and the Notes, and a separate action or actions may be brought and
prosecuted against the Company to enforce this Guaranty, irrespective of whether any action is brought against any Borrower or whether any Borrower is joined in any such action or actions. The liability of the Company under this Guaranty shall be
irrevocable, absolute and unconditional irrespective of, and the Company hereby irrevocably waives any defenses (other than payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations) it may now have or hereafter acquire in any way relating to, any or all of the
following:  (a) any lack of validity or enforceability of this Agreement, any Note or any agreement or instrument relating
thereto;  (b) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Guaranteed
Obligations or any other obligations of any Borrower under or in respect of this Agreement and the Notes, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from this Agreement or any Note, including, without limitation, any increase in
the Guaranteed Obligations resulting from the extension of additional credit to any Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise; 
(c) any taking, exchange, release or non-perfection of any collateral, or any taking,
release or amendment or waiver of, or consent to departure from, any other guaranty, for all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations; 
(d) any manner of application of any collateral, or proceeds thereof, to all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any
manner of sale or other disposition of any collateral for all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other obligations of any Borrower under this Agreement and the Notes or any other assets of any Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries; 
(e) any change, restructuring or termination of the corporate structure or existence of any Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries;  (f) any failure of the Agent or any Lender to disclose to the Company any information relating to the
business, condition (financial or otherwise), operations, performance, properties or prospects of any Borrower now or hereafter known to the Agent or such Lender (the Company waiving any duty on the part of the Agent and the Lenders to disclose such
information); 
 








Jabil Credit Agreement
  
55
  





(g) the failure of any other Person to execute or deliver this Guaranty or
any other guaranty or agreement or the release or reduction of liability of the Company or other guarantor or surety with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations; or 
(h) any other circumstance (including, without limitation, any statute of limitations) or any existence of or reliance on any
representation by the Agent or any Lender that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, any Borrower or any other guarantor or surety. 
This Guaranty shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is
rescinded or must otherwise be returned by the Agent or any Lender or any other Person upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of any Borrower or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made. 
SECTION 7.03. Waivers and Acknowledgments. (a) The Company hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives promptness, diligence,
notice of acceptance, presentment, demand for performance, notice of nonperformance, default, acceleration, protest or dishonor and any other notice with respect to any of the Guaranteed Obligations and this Guaranty and any requirement that the
Agent or any Lender protect, secure, perfect or insure any Lien or any property subject thereto or exhaust any right or take any action against any Borrower or any other Person or any collateral. 
(b) The Company hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives any right to revoke this Guaranty and acknowledges that this
Guaranty is continuing in nature and applies to all Guaranteed Obligations, whether existing now or in the future.  (c) The
Company hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives (i) any defense arising by reason of any claim or defense based upon an election of remedies by the Agent or any Lender that in any manner impairs, reduces, releases or otherwise adversely
affects the subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution or indemnification rights of the Company or other rights of the Company to proceed against any Borrower, any other guarantor or any other Person or any collateral and (ii) any
defense based on any right of set-off or counterclaim against or in respect of the obligations of the Company hereunder. 
(d) The Company hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives any duty on the part of the Agent or any Lender to disclose to
the Company any matter, fact or thing relating to the business, condition (financial or otherwise), operations, performance, properties or prospects of any Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries now or hereafter known by the Agent or such Lender. 
(e) The Company acknowledges that it will receive substantial direct and indirect benefits from the financing arrangements
contemplated by this Agreement and the Notes and that the waivers set forth in Section 7.02 and this Section 7.03 are knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits. 
SECTION 7.04. Subrogation. The Company hereby unconditionally and irrevocably agrees not to exercise any rights that it may now have or
hereafter acquire against any Borrower or any other insider guarantor that arise from the existence, payment, performance or enforcement of the Companys obligations under or in respect of this Guaranty, including, without limitation, any right
of subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution or indemnification and any right to participate in any claim or remedy of the Agent or any Lender against any Borrower or any other insider guarantor or any collateral, whether or not such
claim, remedy or right arises in equity or under contract, statute or common law, including, without limitation, the right to take or receive from any Borrower or any other insider guarantor, directly or indirectly, in cash or other property or by set-off or in any other manner, payment or security on account of such claim, remedy or right, unless and until all of the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty shall have been
paid in full in cash, all Letters of Credit shall have expired or been terminated and the Commitments shall have expired or been terminated. If any amount shall be paid to the Company in violation of the immediately preceding sentence at any time
prior to the latest of (a) the payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty, (b) the latest Termination Date and (c) the latest date of expiration or termination of all
Letters of Credit, such amount shall be received and held in trust for the benefit of the Agent and the Lenders, shall be segregated

from other property and funds of the Company and shall forthwith be paid or delivered to the Agent in the same form as so received (with any necessary endorsement or assignment) to be credited
and applied to the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Notes, or to be held as collateral for any Guaranteed Obligations or
other amounts payable under this Guaranty thereafter arising. If (i) the Company shall make payment to the Agent or any Lender of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations, (ii) all of the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts
payable under this Guaranty shall have been paid in full in cash, (iii) the latest Termination Date shall have occurred and (iv) all Letters of Credit shall have expired or been terminated, the Agent and the Lenders will, at the
Companys request and expense, execute and deliver to the Company appropriate documents, without recourse and without representation or warranty, necessary to evidence the transfer by subrogation to the Company of an interest in the Guaranteed
Obligations resulting from such payment made by the Company pursuant to this Guaranty.  SECTION 7.05. Continuing Guaranty;
Assignments. This Guaranty is a continuing guaranty and shall (a) remain in full force and effect until the latest of (i) the payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty,
(ii) the latest Termination Date and (iii) the latest date of expiration or termination of all Letters of Credit, (b) be binding upon the Company, its successors and permitted assigns and (c) inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the Agent and the Lenders and their successors, permitted transferees and permitted assigns. Without limiting the generality of clause (c) of the immediately preceding sentence, the Agent or any Lender may assign or otherwise
transfer all or any portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, all or any portion of its Commitments, the Advances owing to it and the Note or Notes held by it) to any other Person, and such other
Person shall thereupon become vested with all the benefits in respect thereof granted to the Agent or such Lender herein or otherwise, in each case as and to the extent provided in Section 9.07. 
ARTICLE VIII  THE AGENT 
SECTION 8.01. Authorization and Authority. Each Lender hereby irrevocably appoints Citibank, N.A. to act on its behalf as the Agent
hereunder and authorizes the Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The
provisions of this Article are solely for the benefit of the Agent and the Lenders, and none of the Borrowers shall have rights as a third party beneficiary (other than with respect to Section 8.06) of any of such provisions. It is understood
and agreed that the use of the term agent herein or in any Note (or any other similar term) with reference to the Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of
any applicable law. Instead such term is used as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting parties. 
SECTION 8.02. Rights as a Lender. The Person serving as the Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a
Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Agent and the term Lender or Lenders shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person
serving as the Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, own securities of, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind
of business with the Borrowers or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders. 
SECTION 8.03. Duties of Agent; Exculpatory Provisions. (a) The Agents duties hereunder are solely ministerial and
administrative in nature and the Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Agent: 
(i) shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is
continuing; 
 








Jabil Credit Agreement
  
57
  





(ii) shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise
any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby that the Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be
expressly provided for herein); provided that the Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its reasonable opinion or the reasonable opinion of its counsel, may expose the Agent to liability or that is contrary to this Agreement or
applicable law, including for the avoidance of doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any debtor relief law or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a Defaulting Lender in violation
of any debtor relief law; and  (iii) shall not, except as expressly set forth herein, have any duty to disclose, and shall
not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Company or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. 
(b) The Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders
(or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Sections 9.01 or 6.01) or (ii) in the absence of its own gross
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct. The Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default or the event or events that give or may give rise to any Default unless and until the Company or any Lender shall have given notice to the
Agent describing such Default and such event or events.  (c) The Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or
inquire into (i) any statement, warranty, representation or other information made or supplied in or in connection with this Agreement or the Information Memorandum, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered
hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith or the adequacy, accuracy and/or completeness of the information contained therein, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or
conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement or any other agreement, instrument or document or the perfection or priority of any Lien
or security interest created or purported to be created hereby or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article III or elsewhere herein, other than (but subject to the foregoing clause (ii)) to confirm receipt of items
expressly required to be delivered to the Agent.  (d) Nothing in this Agreement shall require the Agent or any of its Related Parties to
carry out any know your customer or other checks in relation to any person on behalf of any Lender and each Lender confirms to the Agent that it is solely responsible for any such checks it is required to carry out and that it may not
rely on any statement in relation to such checks made by the Agent or any of its Related Parties.  (e) The Agent shall not be responsible
or have any liability for, or have any duty to ascertain, inquire into, monitor or enforce, compliance with the provisions hereof relating to Competitors. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Agent shall not (i) be obligated to
ascertain, monitor or inquire as to whether any Lender or Participant or prospective Lender or Participant is a Competitor or (ii) have any liability with respect to or arising out of any assignment or participation of Advances, or disclosure
of confidential information, to any Competitor.  SECTION 8.04. Reliance by Agent. The Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and
shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it
to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. The Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur
any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of an Advance, or the issuance of a Letter of Credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender, the Agent may presume
that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender unless an officer of the Agent responsible for the transactions contemplated hereby shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender prior to the making of such Advance or the issuance of
such Letter of Credit, and in the case of a Borrowing, such Lender shall not have made available to the Agent such Lenders ratable portion of such Borrowing. The Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrowers),
independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.

SECTION 8.05. Delegation of Duties. The Agent may perform any and all of its duties
and exercise its rights and powers hereunder by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Agent. The Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of
its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties. Each such sub-agent and the Related Parties of the Agent and each such
sub-agent shall be entitled to the benefits of all provisions of this Article VIII and Section 9.04 (as though such sub-agents were the Agent
hereunder) as if set forth in full herein with respect thereto.  SECTION 8.06. Resignation of Agent. (a) The Agent may at any
time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders and the Company. Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, with the consent of the Company (so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, and such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), to appoint a successor, which shall be a bank having a combined capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000 and with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any
such bank with an office in the United States. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its resignation (or such
earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the Resignation Effective Date), then the retiring Agent may (but shall not be obligated to), on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Agent meeting the qualifications
set forth above; provided that in no event shall any such successor Agent be a Defaulting Lender or a Competitor. Whether or not a successor has been appointed, such resignation shall become effective in accordance with such notice on the
Resignation Effective Date.  (b) If the Person serving as Agent is a Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (d) of the definition
thereof, the Required Lenders may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, by notice in writing to the Company and such Person remove such Person as Agent and, with the consent of the Company (so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, and such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), appoint a successor. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days (or such earlier day as
shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the Removal Effective Date), then such removal shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice on the Removal Effective Date. 
(c) With effect from the Resignation Effective Date or the Removal Effective Date (as applicable) (1) the retiring or removed Agent shall
be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the Notes (except that in the case of any collateral security held by the Agent on behalf of the Lenders or the Issuing Banks under the Agreement, the retiring or removed Agent shall
continue to hold such collateral security until such time as a successor Agent is appointed) and (2) except for any indemnity payments owed to the retiring or removed Agent, all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made
by, to or through the Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender directly, until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Agent as provided for above. Upon the acceptance of a successors appointment as Agent
hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring or removed Agent (other than any rights to indemnity payments owed to the retiring or removed Agent), and the retiring
or removed Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the Notes. The fees payable by the Company to a successor Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the
Company and such successor. After the retiring or removed Agents resignation or removal hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 9.04 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring or removed Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring or removed Agent was acting as Agent. 
(d) Any resignation by or removal of a Person acting as Agent pursuant to this Section shall, unless such Person shall notify the Borrowers and
the Lenders otherwise, also act to relieve such Person and its Affiliates of any obligation to advance or issue new, or extend existing, Letters of Credit where such advance, issuance or extension is to occur on or after the effective date of such
resignation. Upon the acceptance of a successors appointment as Agent hereunder, (i) such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Issuing Bank, (ii) the
retiring Issuing Bank shall be discharged 
 








Jabil Credit Agreement
  
59
  






from all of their respective duties and obligations hereunder and (iii) the successor Issuing Bank shall issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any,
outstanding at the time of such succession or make other arrangement satisfactory to the retiring Issuing Bank to effectively assume the obligations of the retiring Issuing Bank with respect to such Letters of Credit. 
SECTION 8.07. Non-Reliance on Agent and Other Lenders. Each Lender acknowledges that it has,
independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement.
Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to
make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any Note or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder. 
SECTION 8.08. Indemnification. (a) Each Lender severally agrees to indemnify the Agent (to the extent not reimbursed by the
Company) from and against such Lenders pro rata share (determined as provided below) of any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever that
may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against the Agent (in its capacity as such) in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any action taken or omitted by the Agent (in its capacity as such) under this Agreement (collectively,
the Indemnified Costs), provided that no Lender shall be liable for any portion of the Indemnified Costs resulting from the Agents gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without limitation of the foregoing, each
Lender agrees to reimburse the Agent promptly upon demand for its pro rata share of any out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable counsel fees) incurred by the Agent
(in its capacity as such) in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or
responsibilities under, this Agreement, to the extent that the Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by the Company. In the case of any investigation, litigation or proceeding giving rise to any Indemnified Costs, this Section 8.08(a)
applies whether any such investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought by the Agent, any Lender or a third party. For purposes of this Section 8.08(a), the Lenders respective pro rata shares of any amount shall be determined, at any
time, according to the sum of (i) the aggregate principal amount of the Advances outstanding at such time and owing to the respective Lenders, (ii) their respective Ratable Shares of the aggregate Available Amount of all Letters of Credit
outstanding at such time, (iii) the aggregate unused portions of their Term Commitments at such time, (iv) their respective Unused Tranche A commitments at such time and (v) their respective Unused Tranche B Commitments at such time.
 (b) Each Tranche A Lender severally agrees to indemnify the Issuing Banks (to the extent not promptly reimbursed by the Company) from and
against such Lenders Ratable Share of any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever that may be imposed on, incurred by, or
asserted against any such Issuing Bank (in its capacity as such) in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any action taken or omitted by such Issuing Bank (in its capacity as such) hereunder or in connection herewith;
provided, however, that no Tranche A Lender shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from such Issuing
Banks gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Tranche A Lender agrees to reimburse any such Issuing Bank promptly upon demand for its Ratable Share of any costs and expenses (including, without
limitation, reasonable, documented and invoiced fees and expenses of counsel) payable by the Company under Section 9.04, to the extent that such Issuing Bank is not promptly reimbursed for such costs and expenses by the Company. 
(c) The failure of any Lender to reimburse the Agent or any Issuing Bank promptly upon demand for its applicable share of any amount required
to be paid by the Lenders to the Agent as provided herein shall not relieve any other Appropriate Lender of its obligation hereunder to reimburse the Agent or any Issuing Bank for its applicable share of such amount, but no Lender shall be
responsible for the failure of any other Appropriate Lender to reimburse the Agent or any Issuing Bank for such other Lenders applicable share of such amount. Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of any Lender hereunder,
the agreement and obligations of each Lender contained in this Section 8.08 shall survive the payment in full of principal, interest and all other amounts payable hereunder and under the Notes. Each of the Agent and each Issuing Bank agrees to
return to the Appropriate Lenders their respective applicable shares of any amounts paid under this Section 8.08 that are subsequently reimbursed by the Company.

this Agreement or any Note; and (y) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by each Issuing Bank in addition to the Lenders required above to take such action, adversely affect the rights or obligations of the
Issuing Banks in their capacities as such under this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Defaulting Lender shall have any right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent hereunder (and any amendment, waiver
or consent which by its terms requires the consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender may be effected with the consent of the applicable Lenders other than Defaulting Lenders), except that (x) the Commitment of any Defaulting Lender may not
be increased or extended, nor amounts owing to such Lender reduced or the final maturity thereof extended, without the consent of such Lender and (y) any waiver, amendment or modification requiring the consent of all Lenders or each affected
Lender that by its terms affects any Defaulting Lender more adversely than other affected Lenders shall require the consent of such Defaulting Lender.

(b) Electronic Communications. Notices and other communications to the Lenders and
the Issuing Banks hereunder may be delivered or furnished by electronic communication (including e-mail and Internet or intranet websites) pursuant to procedures approved by the Agent, provided that the
foregoing shall not apply to notices to any Lender or Issuing Bank pursuant to Article II if such Lender or Issuing Bank, as applicable, has notified the Agent that it is incapable of receiving notices under such Article by electronic communication.
The Agent or the Borrowers may, in its discretion, agree to accept notices and other communications to it hereunder by electronic communications pursuant to procedures approved by it; provided that approval of such procedures may be limited
to particular notices or communications.  Unless the Agent otherwise prescribes, (i) notices and other communications sent to an e-mail address shall be deemed received upon the senders receipt of an acknowledgement from the intended recipient (such as by the return receipt requested function, as available, return e-mail or other written acknowledgement), and (ii) notices or communications posted to an Internet or intranet website shall be deemed received upon the deemed receipt by the intended recipient, at its e-mail address as described in the foregoing clause (i), of notification that such notice or communication is available and identifying the website address therefor; provided that, for both clauses
(i) and (ii) above, if such notice, email or other communication is not sent during the normal business hours of the recipient, such notice or communication shall be deemed to have been sent at the opening of business on the next business day

available to the Issuing Banks and the other Lenders by posting the Communications on Debt Domain, Intralinks, Syndtrak or a substantially similar electronic transmission system (the Platform). 
(ii) The Platform is provided as is and as available. The Agent Parties (as defined below) do not
warrant the adequacy of the Platform and expressly disclaim liability for errors or omissions in the Communications. No warranty of any kind, express, implied or statutory, including, without limitation, any warranty of merchantability, fitness for
a particular purpose, non-infringement of third-party rights or freedom from viruses or other code defects, is made by any Agent Party in connection with the Communications or the Platform. In no event shall
the Agent or any of its Related Parties (collectively, the Agent Parties) have any liability to any Borrower, any Lender or any other Person or entity for damages of any kind, including, without limitation, direct or indirect,
special, incidental or consequential damages, losses or expenses (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) arising out of any Borrowers or the Agents transmission of communications through the Platform, except to the extent resulting from
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of an Agent Party. Communications means, collectively, any notice, demand, communication, information, document or other material that any Borrower provides to the Agent pursuant to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated therein which is distributed to the Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank by means of electronic communications pursuant to this Section, including through the Platform. 
SECTION 9.03. No Waiver; Remedies. No failure on the part of any Lender or the Agent to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right
hereunder or under any Note shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right. The remedies herein provided are cumulative
and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law.  SECTION 9.04. Costs and Expenses. (a) The Company agrees to pay within ten
days of demand therefor all reasonable costs and expenses of the Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification and amendment of this Agreement, the Notes and the other documents to be delivered
hereunder, including, without limitation, (A) all computer, duplication, appraisal, consultant, and audit expenses and (B) the reasonable, documented and invoiced fees and expenses of counsel for the Agent with respect thereto and with
respect to advising the Agent as to its rights and responsibilities under this Agreement. The Company further

agrees to pay on demand all costs and expenses of the Agent and the Lenders, if any (including, without limitation, reasonable counsel fees and expenses), in connection with the enforcement
(whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of this Agreement, the Notes and the other documents to be delivered hereunder, including, without limitation, reasonable, documented and invoiced fees and expenses of counsel for the
Agent and each Lender in connection with the enforcement of rights under this Section 9.04(a).  (b) The Company agrees to indemnify
and hold harmless the Agent and each Lender and each of their Affiliates and their officers, directors, employees, agents and advisors (each, an Indemnified Party) from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities
and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable, documented and invoiced fees and expenses of counsel) incurred by or asserted or awarded against any Indemnified Party, in each case arising out of or in connection with or by reason of
(including, without limitation, in connection with any investigation, litigation or proceeding or preparation of a defense in connection therewith) (i) the Notes, this Agreement, any of the transactions contemplated herein or the actual or
proposed use of the proceeds of the Advances or Letters of Credit or (ii) the actual or alleged presence of Hazardous Materials on any property of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any Environmental Action relating in any way to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except, with respect to any Indemnified Party, to the extent such claim, damage, loss, liability or expense is determined in a final and non-appealable judgment by a court
of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such Indemnified Partys gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct. In the case of an investigation, litigation or other proceeding to which the indemnity in this Section 9.04(b)
applies, such indemnity shall be effective whether or not such investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought by the Company, its directors, equityholders or creditors or an Indemnified Party or any other Person, whether or not any Indemnified
Party is otherwise a party thereto and whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated. The Company also agrees not to assert any claim for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages against the Agent, any Lender, any
of their Affiliates, or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, attorneys and agents, on any theory of liability, arising out of or otherwise relating to the Notes, this Agreement, any of the transactions contemplated herein or the
actual or proposed use of the proceeds of the Advances. Without limiting the provisions of Section 2.14(c), this Section shall not apply with respect to Taxes other than any Taxes that represent losses, claims, damages, etc. arising from any non-Tax claim.  (c) If any payment of principal of, or Conversion of, any Eurocurrency Rate Advance is
made by any Borrower to or for the account of a Lender (i) other than on the last day of the Interest Period for such Advance, as a result of a payment or Conversion pursuant to Section 2.08, 2.09, 2.10 or 2.12, acceleration of the
maturity of the Notes pursuant to Section 6.01 or for any other reason, or by an Eligible Assignee to a Lender other than on the last day of the Interest Period for such Advance upon an assignment of rights and obligations under this Agreement
pursuant to Section 9.07 as a result of a demand by the Company pursuant to Section 9.18 or (ii) as a result of a payment or Conversion pursuant to Section 2.08, 2.10 or 2.12, such Borrower shall, upon demand by such Lender (with
a copy of such demand to the Agent), pay to the Agent for the account of such Lender any amounts required to compensate such Lender for any additional losses, costs or expenses that it may reasonably incur as a result of such payment or Conversion,
including, without limitation, any loss (excluding loss of anticipated profits), cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by any Lender to fund or maintain such Advance. If the amount
of the Committed Currency purchased by any Lender in the case of a Conversion or exchange of Advances in the case of Section 2.08, 2.09 or 2.12 exceeds the sum required to satisfy such Lenders liability in respect of such Advances, such
Lender agrees to remit to the applicable Borrower such excess.  (d) Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of the
Borrowers hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the Borrowers contained in Sections 2.11, 2.14 and 9.04 shall survive the payment in full of principal, interest and all other amounts payable hereunder and under the Notes. 
SECTION 9.05. Right of Set-off. Upon (i) the occurrence and during the continuance of any
Event of Default and (ii) the making of the request or the granting of the consent specified by Section 6.01 to authorize the Agent to declare the Advances due and payable pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.01, each Lender and
each of its Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other
indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender or such Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the Company or any Borrower against any and all of the obligations of the Company or any Borrower 
 








Jabil Credit Agreement

now or hereafter existing under this Agreement and the Note held by such Lender, whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement or such Note and although such
obligations may be unmatured. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Agent and the Company or the applicable Borrower after any such set-off and application, provided that the failure to give such
notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application. The rights of each Lender and its Affiliates under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including, without
limitation, other rights of set-off) that such Lender and its Affiliates may have.  SECTION 9.06.
Binding Effect. This Agreement shall become effective (other than Section 2.01, which shall only become effective upon satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth in Section 3.01) when it shall have been executed by the
Company and the Agent and when the Agent shall have been notified by each Initial Lender that such Initial Lender has executed it and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Company, the Agent and each Lender and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, except that neither the Company nor any other Borrower shall have the right to assign its rights hereunder or any interest herein without the prior written consent of all of the Lenders. 
SECTION 9.07. Assignments and Participations. (a) Successors and Assigns Generally. No Lender or Issuing Bank may assign or
otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder except (i) to an assignee in accordance with the provisions of Section 9.07(b), (ii) by way of participation in accordance with the provisions of Section 9.07(d), or
(iii) by way of pledge or assignment of a security interest subject to the restrictions of Section 9.07(f) (and any other attempted assignment or transfer by any party hereto shall be null and void). Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or
implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants to the extent provided in Section 9.07(d) and, to the extent expressly contemplated
hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Agent, the Lenders and the Issuing Banks) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement. 
(b) Assignments by Lenders and Issuing Banks. Any Lender or Issuing Bank may at any time assign to one or more assignees all or a
portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment (except that an Issuing Bank may only assign all or a portion of its Unissued Letter of Credit Commitment and not its issued Letters of Credit)
and the Advances at the time owing to it); provided that (in each case with respect to any Facility) any such assignment shall be subject to the following conditions: 
(i) Minimum Amounts. 
(A) in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lenders or Issuing Banks
Commitment and/or the Advances at the time owing to it (in each case with respect to any Facility) or contemporaneous assignments to related Approved Funds that equal at least the amount specified in Section 9.07(b)(i)(B) in the aggregate or in
the case of an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund, no minimum amount need be assigned; and 
(B) in any case not described in Section 9.07(b)(i)(A), the aggregate amount of the Commitment (which for this purpose
includes Advances outstanding and participations in Letters of Credit thereunder) or, if the applicable Commitment is not then in effect, the principal outstanding balance of the Advances of the assigning Lender or Issuing Bank subject to each such
assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Agent or, if Trade Date is specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade Date) shall not be less than
$10,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, unless each of the Agent and, so long as no Event of Default pursuant to Section 6.01(a) or (e) has occurred and is continuing, the Company otherwise consents (each such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).  (ii) Proportionate Amounts. Each partial
assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lenders or Issuing Banks rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Advance or the Commitment assigned, except that this clause
(ii) shall not prohibit any Lender from assigning all or a portion of its rights and obligations among separate Facilities on a non-pro rata basis. 
 








Jabil Credit Agreement

(iii) Required Consents. No consent shall be required for any
assignment except to the extent required by Section 9.07(b)(i)(B) and, in addition:  (A) the consent of the Company
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) shall be required unless (x) such assignment is to a financial institution and an Event of Default pursuant to Section 6.01(a) or (e) has occurred and is
continuing at the time of such assignment, or (y) such assignment is to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund; provided that the Company shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment unless it shall object
thereto by written notice to the Agent within ten Business Days after having received notice thereof;  (B) the consent of
the Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) shall be required if such assignment is to a Person that is not a Lender, an Affiliate of such Lender or an Approved Fund; and 
(C) the consent of each Issuing Bank (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) shall be required
for any assignment under the Tranche A Facility.  (iv) Assignment and Assumption. The parties to each assignment
shall execute and deliver to the Agent (with a copy to Company, if the Companys consent thereto is not otherwise required) an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500 (which may be waived or reduced
by the Agent in its sole discretion); provided that the Agent may, in its sole discretion, elect to waive or reduce such processing and recordation fee in the case of any assignment. The assignee, if it is not a Lender, shall deliver to the
Agent an Administrative Questionnaire.  (v) No Assignment to Certain Persons. No such assignment shall be made to
(A) the Company or any of the Companys Affiliates or Subsidiaries, (B) any Defaulting Lender or any of its Affiliates, or any Person who, upon becoming a Lender hereunder, would constitute any of the foregoing Persons described in
this clause (B) or (C) any Person that was a Competitor as of the Trade Date (in which case the provisions of Section 9.07(h) shall apply). 
(vi) No Assignment to Natural Persons. No such assignment shall be made to a natural Person (or holding company,
investment vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated for the primary benefit of, a natural Person).  (vii) Certain
Additional Payments. In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the
parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments to the Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations,
or other compensating actions, including funding, with the consent of the Company and the Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Advances previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and
assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Agent, each Issuing Bank and each other Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon), and
(y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro rata share of all Advances and participations in Letters of Credit in accordance with its Ratable Share. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and
obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under applicable law without compliance with the provisions of this clause (vii), then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of
this Agreement until such compliance occurs.  Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Agent pursuant to Section 9.07(c),
from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations
of a Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender or Issuing Bank thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this
Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all 
 








Jabil Credit Agreement
  
66
  






of the assigning Lenders or Issuing Banks rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender or Issuing Bank shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled
to the benefits of Sections 2.11 and 9.04 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment; provided, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no assignment
by a Defaulting Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lenders having been a Defaulting Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that
does not comply with this Section 9.07(b) shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with Section 9.07(d) (except in the event that such
assignment or transfer was to a person that was a Competitor as of the Trade Date (in which case the provisions of Section 9.07(h) shall apply)). 
(c) Register. The Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrowers, shall maintain at one of its offices in the United
States a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts of the Advances owing to, each Lender
and Issuing Bank pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the Register). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrowers, the Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name
is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender or an Issuing Bank, as the case may be, hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by any Borrower, any Lender (solely with
respect to its own interest in any Borrowing or Commitment) and any Issuing Bank, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. 
(d) Participations. 
(i) Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, the Company or the Agent, sell participations to any
Person (other than the Company, any of the Companys Affiliates, any natural Person, or a holding company, investment vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated for the primary benefit of, a natural Person, or, unless the Companys prior
consent is obtained and in accordance with the provisions of Section 9.07(h), a Competitor) (each buyer of a Participation, a Participant) in all or a portion of such Lenders rights and/or obligations under this
Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Advances owing to it); provided that (A) such Lenders obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the
other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, and (C) the Borrowers, the Agent and the Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lenders rights and obligations under this
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, each Lender shall be responsible for the indemnity under Section 8.08 with respect to any payments made by such Lender to its Participant(s). 
(ii) Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall
retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, waiver or consent of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the
Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in clause (a) of the first proviso of Section 9.01 that directly affects such Participant. The Borrowers agree that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of
Section 2.11 and 2.14 (it being understood that the documentation required under Section 2.14 shall be delivered by the Participant solely to the participating Lender) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest
by assignment pursuant to Section 9.07(b); provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to the provisions of Sections 9.18 as if it were an assignee under Section 9.07(b). To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also
shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.05 as though it were a Lender; provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.15 as though it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for
this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrowers, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each
Participants interest in the Note or other obligations under this Agreement or the Notes or any other documents to be delivered hereunder (the Participant Register); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all
or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participants interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any this Agreement or the
Notes or any other documents to be delivered hereunder) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is 
 








Jabil Credit Agreement
  
67
  






necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United
States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all
purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Agent (in its capacity as Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register. 
(e) Limitations upon Participant Rights. A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 2.11 and 2.14
than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Companys prior written consent. A Participant
that is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside of the United States shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.14 unless the Company is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for
the benefit of the Borrowers, to comply with Section 2.14(e) as though it were a Lender.  (f) Certain Pledges. Notwithstanding
any other provision set forth in this Agreement, any Lender may at any time create a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender (including, without limitation, any pledge or
assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank or any central bank having jurisdiction over such Lender) and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that, no such pledge or
assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender party hereto interest. 
(g) Resignation as Issuing Bank after Assignment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if at any time any Issuing
Bank assigns all of its Tranche A Commitments and Advances pursuant to Section 9.07(a), such Person may, upon 30 days notice to the Company and the Lenders, resign as Issuing Bank. In the event of any such resignation as Issuing
Bank, the Company shall be entitled to appoint from among the Tranche A Lenders a successor Issuing Bank hereunder; provided, however, that no failure by the Company to appoint any such successor shall affect the resignation of such
Person as Issuing Bank and any Lender so appointed agrees to serve as an Issuing Bank. If such Person resigns as Issuing Bank, it shall retain all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of an Issuing Bank hereunder with respect to all Letters of
Credit outstanding as of the effective date of its resignation as Issuing Bank and all unreimbursed Letter of Credit drawings with respect thereto. Upon the appointment of a successor Issuing Bank, (a) such successor shall succeed to and become
vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Issuing Bank and (b) the successor Issuing Bank shall issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such
succession or make other arrangements satisfactory to such Person to effectively assume the obligations of such Pe

h respect to any assignee or participant that becomes a Competitor after the applicable Determination Date (including as a result of the
delivery of a notice pursuant to, and/or the expiration of the notice period referred to in, the definition of Competitor), (x) such assignee or participant shall not retroactively be disqualified from becoming a Lender or participant
and (y) the execution by the Company of an Assignment and Assumption with respect to an assignee will not by itself result in such assignee no longer being considered a Competitor. Any assignment or participation in violation of this
Section 9.07(h) shall not be void, but the other provisions of this Section 9.07(h) shall apply. If any assignment is made or any participation is sold to any Competitor without the Companys prior written consent, or if any Person
becomes a Competitor after the applicable Determination Date, the Company may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to the applicable Competitor and the Agent, (A) terminate any Commitment of such Competitor and/or repay all obligations
of the Borrowers owing to such Competitor in connection with such Commitment and/or (B) require such Competitor to assign, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in this Section 9.07), all of its

 








Jabil Credit Agreement
  
68
  






interest, rights and obligations under this Agreement (including as a participant) to one or more Eligible Assignees at the lesser of (x) the principal amount thereof and (y) the amount
that such Competitor paid to acquire such interests, rights and obligations, in each case plus accrued interest, accrued fees and all other amounts (other than principal amounts) payable to it hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, Competitors (A) will not (x) have the right to receive information, reports or other materials provided to Lenders by the Borrowers, the Agent or any other Lender, (y) attend or participate in meetings
attended by the Lenders and the Agent, or (z) access any electronic site established for the Lenders or confidential communications from counsel to or financial advisors of the Agent or the Lenders and (B) (x) for purposes of any consent
to any amendment, waiver or modification of, or any action under, and for the purpose of any direction to the Agent or any Lender to undertake any action (or refrain from taking any action) under this Agreement, each Competitor will be deemed to
have consented in the same proportion as the Lenders that are not Competitors consented to such matter, and (y) for purposes of voting on any plan of reorganization or plan of liquidation pursuant to any debtor relief laws (a
Plan), each Competitor party hereto hereby agrees (1) not to vote on such Plan, (2) if such Competitor does vote on such Plan notwithstanding the restriction in clause (1) above, such vote will be deemed not to be
in good faith and shall be designated pursuant to Section 1126(e) of the Bankruptcy Code (or any similar provision in any other debtor relief laws), and such vote shall not be counted in determining whether the applicable class has
accepted or rejected such Plan in accordance with Section 1126(c) of the Bankruptcy Code (or any similar provision in any other debtor relief laws) and (3) not to contest any request by any party for a determination by the Bankruptcy Court
(or other applicable court of competent jurisdiction) effectuating clause (2) above. The Agent shall have the right, and the Company hereby expressly authorizes the Agent, to (A) post the list of Competitors provided by the Company and any
updates thereto from time to time (collectively, the Competitor List) on the Platform, including that portion of the Platform that is designated for public side Lenders and/or (B) provide the Competitor List to
each Lender requesting the same. The Agent shall not (x) be obligated to ascertain, monitor or inquire as to whether any Lender or participant is a Competitor or (y) have any liability with respect to any assignment or sale of a
participation to a Competitor.  SECTION 9.08. Confidentiality. Neither the Agent nor any Lender may disclose to any Person any
Company Information (as defined below), except that each of the Agent and each of the Lenders may disclose Company Information (a) to its and its Affiliates respective managers, administrators, trustees, partners, employees, officers,
directors, agents and advisors (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Company Information and such person shall have agreed to keep such Company Information
confidential on substantially the same terms as provided herein), (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority purporting to have jurisdiction over it (including any self-regulatory authority, such as the National Association of
Insurance Commissioners), (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process or requested by any self-regulatory authority, provided that, to the extent practicable and legally
permissible, the Company is given prompt written notice of such requirement or request prior to such disclosure and assistance (to the extent practicable and at the Companys expense) in obtaining an order protecting such information from
public disclosure, (d) to any other party to this Agreement, (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the enforcement of rights hereunder,
(f) subject to an agreement containing provisions no less restrictive than those of this Section 9.08, to (i) any assignee of or participant in, or any prospective assignee of or participant in, any of its rights or obligations under
this Agreement, (ii) any actual or prospective party (or its managers, administrators, trustees, partners, directors, officers, employees, agents, advisors and other representatives) to any swap, derivative or other transaction under which
payments are to be made by reference to the Company and its obligations, this Agreement or payments hereunder or to any credit insurance provider relating to the Company and its obligations hereunder, (iii) any rating agency, or (iv) the
CUSIP Service Bureau or any similar organization, (g) to the extent such Company Information (A) is or becomes generally available to the public on a non-confidential basis other than as a result of
a breach of this Section 9.08 by the Agent or such Lender, or (B) is or becomes available to the Agent or such Lender on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Company and not, to the knowledge of the Agent or such Lender, in
breach of such third partys obligations of confidentiality and (h) with the consent of the Company.  For purposes of this
Section, Company Information means all confidential, proprietary or non-public information received from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective businesses, other than any such information that is available to the Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Any Person
required to maintain the confidentiality of Company Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of
such Company Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information, but in no event less than a reasonable degree of care.

SECTION 9.09. Designated Subsidiaries. (a) Designation. The Company may
at any time, and from time to time, upon not less than 15 Business Days notice, notify the Agent that the Company intends to designate a Subsidiary as a Designated Subsidiary for purposes of this Agreement. On or after the date
that is 15 Business Days after such notice, upon delivery to the Agent and each Lender of a Designation Letter duly executed by the Company and the respective Subsidiary and substantially in the form of Exhibit D hereto, such Subsidiary shall
thereupon become a Designated Subsidiary for purposes of this Agreement and, as such, shall have all of the rights and obligations of a Borrower hereunder. The Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the Companys notice of such
pending designation by the Company and the identity of the respective Subsidiary. Following the giving of any notice pursuant to this Section 9.09(a), if the designation of such Designated Subsidiary obligates the Agent or any Lender to comply
with know your customer or similar identification procedures in circumstances where the necessary information is not already available to it, the Company shall, promptly upon the reasonable request of the Agent or any Lender, supply such
documentation and other evidence as is reasonably requested by the Agent or any Lender in order for the Agent or such Lender to carry out and be satisfied it has complied with the results of all necessary know your customer or other
similar checks under all applicable laws and regulations.  If the Company shall designate as a Designated Subsidiary hereunder any
Subsidiary not organized under the laws of the United States or any State thereof, any Lender may, with notice to the Agent and the Company, fulfill its Commitment by causing an Affiliate or branch of such Lender to act as the Lender in respect of
such Designated Subsidiary.  As soon as practicable after receiving notice from the Company or the Agent of the Companys intent to
designate a Subsidiary as a Designated Subsidiary, and in any event no later than five Business Days after the delivery of such notice, for a Designated Subsidiary that is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction other than of the United States or
a political subdivision thereof, any Lender that either (i) may not legally lend to, establish credit for the account of and/or do any business whatsoever with such Designated Subsidiary directly or through an Affiliate of such Lender as
provided in the immediately preceding paragraph or (ii) has internal policies in place that prohibit it from lending to, establishing credit for the account of and/or doing any business whatsoever with such Designated Subsidiary directly or
through an Affiliate of such Lender as provided in the immediately preceding paragraph (a Protesting Lender) shall so notify the Company and the Agent in writing. With respect to each Protesting Lender, the Company shall,
effective on or before the date that such Designated Subsidiary shall have the right to borrow hereunder, either (A) notify the Agent and such Protesting Lender that the Commitments of such Protesting Lender shall be terminated; provided
that such Protesting Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Advances and/or Letter of Credit reimbursement obligations, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it
hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Company or the relevant Designated Subsidiary (in the case of all other amounts) or (B) cancel its request to designate such
Subsidiary as a Designated Subsidiary hereunder.  (b) Termination. If so requested by the Company, upon the payment and
performance in full of all of the indebtedness, liabilities and obligations under this Agreement of any Designated Subsidiary then, so long as at the time no Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Issuance in respect of such Designated Subsidiary is
outstanding, such Subsidiarys status as a Designated Subsidiary shall terminate upon notice to such effect from the Agent to the Lenders (which notice the Agent shall give promptly, and only upon its receipt of a request therefor
from the Company). Thereafter, the Lenders shall be under no further obligation to make any Advance hereunder to such Designated Subsidiary. 
SECTION 9.10. Governing Law. This Agreement and the Notes and any claims, controversy, dispute or cause of action (whether in contract
or tort or otherwise) based upon, arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any Note and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the law of the State of New York.

SECTION 9.11. Execution in Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number
of counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by telecopier shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement. 
SECTION 9.12. Judgment. (a) If for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder
in Dollars into another currency, the parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent that they may effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be the spot rate of exchange that appears at 11:00 A.M. (London time), on the display page
applicable to the relevant currency on the Oanda website on the Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is given.  (b) If for
the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder in a Committed Currency into Dollars, the parties agree to the fullest extent that they may effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be the
spot rate of exchange that appears at 11:00 A.M. (London time), on the display page applicable to such Committed Currency on the Oanda website on the Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is given. 
(c) The obligation of any Borrower in respect of any sum due from it in any currency (the Primary Currency) to any Lender or
the Agent hereunder shall, notwithstanding any judgment in any other currency, be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be), of any sum adjudged to be so due in such
other currency, such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase the applicable Primary Currency with such other currency; if the amount of the applicable Primary Currency so purchased is less
than such sum due to such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) in the applicable Primary Currency, each Borrower agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be)
against such loss, and if the amount of the applicable Primary Currency so purchased exceeds such sum due to any Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) in the applicable Primary Currency, such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) agrees to
remit to such Borrower such excess.  SECTION 9.13. Jurisdiction, Etc. (a) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally agrees that it will not commence any action, litigation or proceeding of any kind or description, whether in law or equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any other party hereto or any Related Party of the
foregoing in any way relating to this Agreement or any Note or the transactions relating hereto or thereto, in any forum other than the courts of the State of New York sitting in New York County, and of the United States District Court of the
Southern District of New York, and any appellate court from any thereof, and each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the jurisdiction of such courts and agrees that all claims in respect of any such action, litigation
or proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York State court or, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in such federal court. Each of the pa

irrevocably waives such immunity in respect of its obligations under this Agreement. 
 








Jabil Credit Agreement
  
71
  





(b) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent
it may legally and effectively do so, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Notes in any New York State or federal court.
Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court. 
SECTION 9.14. Substitution of Currency. If a change in any Committed Currency occurs pursuant to any applicable law, rule or regulation
of any governmental, monetary or multi-national authority, this Agreement (including, without limitation, the definition of Eurocurrency Rate) will be deemed amended to the extent determined by the Agent (acting reasonably and in consultation with
the Company) to be necessary to reflect the change in currency and to put the Lenders and the Borrowers in the same position, so far as possible, that they would have been in if no change in such Committed Currency had occurred. 
SECTION 9.15. No Liability of the Issuing Banks. The Borrowers assume all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or
transferee of any Letter of Credit with respect to its use of such Letter of Credit. Neither an Issuing Bank nor any of its officers or directors shall be liable or responsible for: (a) the use that may be made of any Letter of Credit or any
acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee in connection therewith; (b) the validity, sufficiency or genuineness of documents, or of any endorsement thereon, even if such documents should prove to be in any or all respects invalid,
insufficient, fraudulent or forged; or (c) any other circumstances whatsoever in making or failing to make payment under any Letter of Credit, except that the applicable Borrower shall have a claim against such Issuing Bank, and such Issuing
Bank shall be liable to such Borrower, to the extent of any direct, but not consequential, damages suffered by such Borrower that such Borrower proves were caused by such Issuing Banks willful misconduct or gross negligence when determining
whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, such Issuing Bank may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without
responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary; provided that nothing herein shall be deemed to excuse such Issuing Bank if it acts with gross negligence or willful misconduct in accepting
such documents.  SECTION 9.16. Patriot Act Notice. Each Lender and the Agent (for itself and not on behalf of any Lender) hereby
notifies each Borrower that pursuant to the requirements of the Patriot Act, it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each Borrower, which information includes the name and address of each Borrower and other
information that will allow such Lender or the Agent, as applicable, to identify each Borrower in accordance with the Patriot Act. Each Borrower shall provide such information and take such actions as are reasonably requested by the Agent or any
Lenders in order to assist the Agent and the Lenders in maintaining compliance with the Patriot Act.  SECTION 9.17. Power of
Attorney. Each Designated Subsidiary of the Company, pursuant to the terms of its Designation Agreement, has authorized and appointed the Company as its
attorney-in-fact to execute and deliver (a) any amendment, waiver or consent in accordance with Section 9.01 on behalf of and in the name of such Subsidiary
and (b) any notice or other communication hereunder, on behalf of and in the name of such Subsidiary.  SECTION 9.18. Replacement
of Lenders. If (a) any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.11 or 2.14, (b) any Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any governmental authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to
Section 2.14, (c) any Lender asserts illegality pursuant to Section 2.12, (d) any Lender is a Defaulting Lender or (e) any Lender has not agreed to any amendment, waiver or consent for which (x) the consent of all of the Lenders
is required and (y) Lenders owed or holding at least 50% of the sum of all outstanding Revolving Credit Advances and Term Advances plus the aggregate Unused Tranche A Commitments and Unused Tranche B Commitments have agreed to such amendment,
waiver or consent, then the Company may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and
consents required by, Section 9.07), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an Eligible Assignee that shall assume such obligations (which Eligible Assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such
assignment), provided that (i) each such assignment shall be arranged by the Company after consultation with the Agent and shall be either an assignment of all of the rights and obligations of the assigning Lender under this

 








Jabil Credit Agreement
  
72
  






Agreement or an assignment of a portion of such rights and obligations made concurrently with another such assignment or other such assignments that together cover all of the rights and
obligations of the assigning Lender under this Agreement, (ii) no Lender shall be obligated to make any such assignment unless and until such Lender shall have received one or more payments from either the Borrowers or one or more Eligible
Assignees in an aggregate amount equal to the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Advances owing to such Lender, together with accrued interest thereon to the date of payment of such principal amount and all other amounts payable to such
Lender under this Agreement and (iii) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise,
the circumstances entitling the Company to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.  SECTION 9.19. No Fiduciary
Duties. Each Borrower agrees that in connection with all aspects of the transactions contemplated hereby and any communications in connection therewith, such Borrower and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Agent, the Issuing Banks, the
Lenders and their respective Affiliates, on the other hand, will have a business relationship that does not create, by implication or otherwise, any fiduciary duty on the part of the Agent, the Issuing Banks, the Lenders and or respective Affiliates
and no such duty will be deemed to have arisen in connection with any such transactions or communications.  SECTION 9.20.
Acknowledgement and Consent to Bail-In of Certain Financial Institutions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or in any other agreement, arrangement or understanding among any
such parties, each party hereto acknowledges and accepts that any liability of any party to any other party under or in connection with this Agreement may be subject to Bail-In Action by the relevant
Resolution Authority and acknowledges and accepts to be bound by the effect of:  (a) any Bail-In
Action in relation to any such liability, including (without limitation):  (i) a reduction in full or in part, in the
principal amount, or outstanding amount due (including any accrued but unpaid interest) in respect of any such liability; 
(ii) a conversion of all, or part of, such liability into shares or other instruments of ownership that may be 



SECTION 9.21. Waiver of Jury Trial. Each party hereto hereby
irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any right it may have to a trial by jury in any legal proceeding directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any Note or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby (whether based on contract, tort or any other theory). Each party hereto (a) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any other Person has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other Person
would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto have been induced to enter into this Agreement and any notes by, among other things, the mutual
waivers and certifications in this section.  IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be executed by their
respective officers thereunto duly authorized, as of the date first above written.
