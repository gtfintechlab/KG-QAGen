2.1.                            Commitment.  Each Lender severally agrees, from and including the date of this Agreement to the Facility Termination Date applicable to such Lender, on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, to make Loans to the Borrowers in Dollars or Committed Currencies; provided that, after giving effect to the making of each such Loan, such Lenders Outstanding Credit Exposure (based in respect of any Loans to be denominated in a Committed Currency by reference to the Equivalent thereof in Dollars determined on the date of determination of the Eurocurrency Base Rate applicable thereto) shall not exceed in the aggregate at any one time outstanding the amount of its Commitment.  Subject to the terms of this Agreement, the Borrowers may borrow, repay and reborrow under this Section 2.1.  The Commitment of each Lender to lend hereunder shall expire on the Facility Termination Date applicable to such Lender.
 
2.2.                            Required Payments.  All unpaid Obligations owed to each Lender by any Borrower shall be paid in full by such Borrower on the Facility Termination Date applicable to such Lender.
 
2.3.                            Ratable Loans.  Each Advance hereunder shall consist of Loans made from the several Lenders ratably in proportion to the ratio that their respective Commitments bear to the Aggregate Commitment.
 
2.4.                            Types of Advances.  The Advances denominated in Dollars may be Alternate Base Rate Advances or Eurocurrency Advances, or a combination thereof, selected by the
 
22





 
applicable Borrower in accordance with Sections 2.8 and 2.9.  The Advances denominated in a Committed Currency shall be Eurocurrency Advances, as selected by the applicable Borrower in accordance with Sections 2.8 and 2.9.
 
2.5.                            Facility Fee; Reductions in Aggregate Commitment.  The Parent agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a facility fee at a per annum rate equal to the Applicable Facility Fee Rate on such Lenders Commitment from the date hereof to the Facility Termination Date applicable to such Lender, payable on each Payment Date hereafter and on the Facility Termination Date applicable to such Lender, provided that the Parent shall not pay any facility fee nor shall any facility fee accrue in respect of a Defaulting Lenders unused Commitment so long as such Defaulting Lender is a Defaulting Lender.  The Parent may permanently reduce the Aggregate Commitment in whole, or in part ratably among the Lenders in a minimum aggregate amount of $5,000,000 or any integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, upon at least three (3) Business Days written notice to the Administrative Agent, which notice shall specify the amount of any such reduction, provided, however, that the amount of the Aggregate Commitment may not be reduced below the Aggregate Outstanding Credit Exposure.  All accrued facility fees shall be payable on the effective date of any termination of the obligations of the Lenders to make Credit Extensions hereunder.
 
2.6.                            Minimum Amount of Each Advance.  Each Advance shall be at least the Borrowing Minimum (and in multiples of the Borrowing Multiple if in excess thereof); provided, however, that (a) any Alternate Base Rate Advance may be in the amount of the unused Aggregate Commitment and (b) in no event shall more than six (6) Eurocurrency Advances be permitted to be outstanding at any time.
 
2.7.                            Principal Payments.  (a)  Optional.  The Borrowers may from time to time pay, without penalty or premium, all outstanding Alternate Base Rate Advances, or, in a minimum aggregate amount of $5,000,000 or any integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, any portion of the outstanding Alternate Base Rate Advances upon notice to the Administrative Agent by 11:00 a.m. (New York time) on the Business Day of the proposed prepayment.  The Borrowers may from time to time pay, subject to the payment of any funding indemnification amounts required by Section 3.4 but without penalty or premium, all outstanding Eurocurrency Advances, or, in a minimum aggregate amount of the Borrowing Minimum or any integral multiple of the Borrowing Multiple in excess thereof, any portion of an outstanding Eurocurrency Advance, upon two (2) Business Days prior notice to the Administrative Agent.
 
(b)                                 Mandatory.  (i)  If, on any date, the Administrative Agent notifies the Parent that, on any date of determination (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall be no less frequently than quarterly), the sum of (A) the aggregate principal amount of all Advances denominated in Dollars plus (B) the Equivalent in Dollars (determined on the third Business Day prior to such determination date) of the aggregate principal amount of all Advances denominated in Committed Currencies then outstanding exceeds 103% of the Aggregate Commitment on such date, the Borrowers shall, as soon as practicable and in any event within two Business Days after receipt of such notice, prepay the outstanding principal amount of any Advances owing by the Borrowers in an aggregate amount sufficient to reduce such sum to an amount not to exceed 100% of the Aggregate Commitment on such date.  The Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice of any prepayment required under this Section 2.7(b)(i) to the Parent and the Lenders, and
 
23





 
shall provide prompt notice to the Parent of any such notice of required prepayment received by it from any Lender.
 
(ii)                                  Each prepayment made pursuant to this Section 2.7(b) shall be made together with any interest accrued to the date of such prepayment on the principal amounts prepaid and, in the case of any prepayment of a Eurocurrency Advance on a date other than the last day of an Interest Period or at its maturity, any additional amounts which the applicable Borrower shall be obligated to reimburse to the Lenders in respect thereof pursuant to Section 3.4.
 
2.8.                            Method of Selecting Types and Interest Periods for New Advances.  The applicable Borrower shall select the Type of Advance and, in the case of each Eurocurrency Advance, the currency and Interest Period applicable thereto from time to time.  The applicable Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent irrevocable notice (a Borrowing Notice) not later than 12:00 p.m. (New York time) on the Borrowing Date of each Alternate Base Rate Advance and at least three (3) Business Days before the Borrowing Date for each Eurocurrency Advance, specifying:
 
(a)                                 the Borrowing Date of such Advance, which shall be a Business Day;
 
(b)                                 the aggregate amount and currency of such Advance;
 
(c)                                  the Type of Advance selected; and
 
(d)                                 in the case of each Eurocurrency Advance, the Interest Period applicable thereto, which shall end on or prior to the latest Facility Termination Date.
 
Each Lender shall, before 2:00 p.m. (New York time) on the applicable Borrowing Date, in the case of an Advance denominated in Dollars, and before 9:00 a.m. (New York time) on the applicable Borrowing Date, in the case of an Advance consisting of Eurocurrency Loans denominated in any Committed Currency, make available for the account of its applicable Lending Installation to the Administrative Agent at the applicable Administrative Agents Account, in same day funds, such Lenders ratable portion of such Advance.  After the Administrative Agents receipt of such funds, the Administrative Agent will make such funds available to the Borrower requesting the Advance at the Administrative Agents address referred to in Article XIII or at the applicable Payment Office, as the case may be.
 
2.9.                            Conversion and Continuation of Outstanding Advances.  Each Alternate Base Rate Advance shall continue as an Alternate Base Rate Advance unless and until such Alternate Base Rate Advance is converted into a Eurocurrency Advance pursuant to this Section 2.9 or is repaid in accordance with Section 2.7.  Each Eurocurrency Advance shall continue as a Eurocurrency Advance until the end of the then applicable Interest Period therefor, at which time such Eurocurrency Advance, if denominated in Dollars shall be automatically converted into an Alternate Base Rate Advance or, if denominated in a Committed Currency, be exchanged for an Equivalent amount of Dollars and converted into an Alternate Base Rate Advance, unless (a) such Eurocurrency Advance is or was repaid in accordance with Section 2.7 or (b) the applicable Borrower shall have given the Administrative Agent a Conversion/Continuation Notice (as defined below) requesting that, at the end of such Interest Period, such Eurocurrency Advance continue as a Eurocurrency Advance for the same or another Interest Period.  Subject to the
 
24





 
terms of Section 2.6, the applicable Borrower may elect from time to time to convert all or any part of an Alternate Base Rate Advance into a Eurocurrency Advance denominated in Dollars.  Subject to the payment of any funding indemnification amounts required by Section 3.4, the applicable Borrower may elect from time to time to convert all or any part of a Eurocurrency Advance denominated in Dollars into an Alternate Base Rate Advance.  The applicable Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent irrevocable notice (a Conversion/Continuation Notice) of each (x) conversion of an Alternate Base Rate Advance into a Eurocurrency Advance or the continuation of a Eurocurrency Advance as a new Eurocurrency Advance not later than 11:00 a.m. (New York time) at least three (3) Business Days prior to the date of the requested conversion or continuation and (y) conversion of a Eurocurrency Advance into an Alternate Base Rate Advance, not later than 12:00 p.m. (New York time) on the date of the requested conversion, in each case specifying:
 
(a)                                 the requested date of such conversion or continuation, which shall be a Business Day;
 
(b)                                 the aggregate amount and Type of the Advance which is to be converted or continued; and
 
(c)                                  the amount and Type(s) of Advance(s) into which such Advance is to be converted or continued and, in the case of a conversion into or continuation of a Eurocurrency A

o the latest Facility Termination Date.
 
2.10.                     Changes in Interest Rate, etc.  Each Alternate Base Rate Advance shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof, for each day from and including the date such Advance is made or is converted from a Eurocurrency Advance into an Alternate Base Rate Advance pursuant to Section 2.9, to but excluding the date it is paid or is converted into a Eurocurrency Advance pursuant to Section 2.9 hereof, at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate for such day.  Changes in the rate of interest on that portion of any Advance maintained as an Alternate Base Rate Advance will take effect simultaneously with each change in the Alternate Base Rate.  Each Eurocurrency Advance shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from and including the first day of the Interest Period applicable thereto to (but not including) the last day of such Interest Period at the Eurocurrency Rate determined by the Administrative Agent as applicable to such Eurocurrency Advance based upon the applicable Borrowers selections under Sections 2.8 and 2.9 and otherwise in accordance with the terms hereof.  No Interest Period may end after the latest Facility Termination Date.
 
2.11.                     Rates Applicable After Default.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 2.8 or 2.9, no Advance may be made as, converted into or continued as a Eurocurrency Advance (except with the consent of the Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders) when any Default or Unmatured Default has occurred and is continuing.  During the continuance of a Default the Required Lenders may, at their option, by notice to the Borrowers (which notice may be revoked at the option of the Required Lenders notwithstanding any provision of Section 8.2 requiring unanimous consent of the Lenders to changes in interest rates), declare that (a) each Eurocurrency Advance shall bear interest for the remainder of the applicable Interest Period at the Eurocurrency Rate otherwise applicable to such Interest Period plus 2% per
 
25





 
annum and (b) each Alternate Base Rate Advance, shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate in effect from time to time plus 2% per annum provided that, during the continuance of a Default under Section 7.6 or 7.7, the interest rates set forth in clauses (a) and (b) above shall be applicable to all Credit Extensions without any election or action on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender.
 
2.12.                     Method of Payment.  All payments of the Obligations hereunder (except with respect to principal of, interest on, and other amounts relating to, Advances denominated in a Committed Currency) shall be made by the applicable Borrower, without setoff, deduction or counterclaim, in immediately available funds to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agents address specified pursuant to Article XIII, or at any other Lending Installation of the Administrative Agent specified in writing by the Administrative Agent to the Borrowers, by 12:00 p.m. (New York time) on the date when due in Dollars and shall be applied ratably by the Administrative Agent among the Lenders entitled to such payments.  All payments of principal of, interest on, and other amounts relating to, Advances denominated in a Committed Currency shall be made by the applicable Borrower, without setoff, deduction or counterclaim, in immediately available funds to the Administrative Agent at the Payment Office for such Committed Currency, by 12:00 p.m. (New York time) on the date when due in the applicable Committed Currency and shall be applied ratably by the Administrative Agent among the Lenders entitled to such payments.  Each payment delivered to the Administrative Agent for the account of any Lender shall be delivered promptly by the Administrative Agent to such Lender in the same type of funds that the Administrative Agent received at its address specified pursuant to Article XIII or at any Lending Installation specified in a notice received by the Administrative Agent from such Lender.  The Administrative Agent is hereby authorized to charge the account of each Borrower maintained with Citibank for each payment of principal, interest and fees owing by such Borrower as it becomes due hereunder.
 
2.13.                     Noteless Agreement; Evidence of Indebtedness.  (a)  Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of each Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender from time to time, including the currency and amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.
 
(b)                                 The Administrative Agent shall also maintain accounts in which it will record (i) the currency and amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Type thereof and the Interest Period with respect thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from each Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder from each Borrower and each Lenders share thereof.
 
(c)                                  The entries maintained in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) above shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the Obligations therein recorded; provided, however, that the failure of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of any Borrower to repay the Obligations in accordance with their terms; provided further, that in the event of any conflict between the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) above, the accounts maintained by the Administrative Agent in the Register shall control.
 
26





 
(d)                                 Any Lender may request that its Loans be evidenced by a promissory note in substantially the form of Exhibit A (including any amendment, modification, renewal or replacement thereof, a Note).  In such event, each Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender such Note payable to such Lender.  Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such Note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after any assignment pursuant to Section 12.3) be represented by one or more Notes payable to the payee named therein or any assignee pursuant to Section 12.3, except to the extent that any such Lender or assignee subsequently returns any such Note for cancellation and requests that such Loans once again be evidenced as described in paragraphs (a) and (b) above.  Upon receipt of an affidavit of an officer of any Lender as to the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of such Lenders Note, and, in the case of any such loss, theft, destruction or mutilation, upon cancellation of such Note, each Borrower will issue, in lieu thereof, a replacement Note in the same principal amount thereof and otherwise of like tenor.
 
2.14.                     Telephonic Notices.  The Lenders and the Administrative Agent may extend, convert or continue Advances, effect selections of Types of Advances and transfer funds based on telephonic notices made by any person or persons the Administrative Agent or any Lender in good faith believes to be acting on behalf of a Borrower.  Each Borrower agrees to deliver promptly to the Administrative Agent a written confirmation of each telephonic notice signed by an Authorized Officer of such Borrower.  If the written confirmation differs in any material respect from the action taken by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, the records of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall govern absent demonstrable error.
 
2.15.                     Interest Payment Dates; Interest and Fee Basis.  Interest accrued on each Alternate Base Rate Advance shall be payable on each Payment Date, commencing with the first such date to occur after the date hereof, on any date on which an Alternate Base Rate Advance is prepaid (with respect to the principal so prepaid), whether due to acceleration or otherwise, and at maturity.  Interest accrued on that portion of the outstanding principal amount of any Alternate Base Rate Advance converted into a Eurocurrency Advance on a day other than a Payment Date shall be payable on the date of conversion.  Interest accrued on each Eurocurrency Advance shall be payable on the last day of its applicable Interest Period, on any date on which the Eurocurrency Advance is prepaid (with respect to the principal so prepaid), whether by acceleration or otherwise, and at maturity.  Interest accrued on each Eurocurrency Advance having an Inter

erval during such Interest Period.  Interest with respect to Eurocurrency Loans and facility fees shall be calculated for actual days elapsed on the basis of a 360-day year.  Interest with respect to Alternate Base Rate Loans shall be calculated for the actual days elapsed on the basis of a 365 or 366-day year, as applicable.  Interest shall be payable for the day an Advance is made but not for the day of any payment on the amount paid if payment is made in full and received prior to 12:00 p.m. (New York time) at the place of payment.  If any payment of principal of or interest on an Advance shall become due on a day which is not a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of a principal payment, such extension of time shall be included in computing interest in connection with such payment.
 
2.16.                     Notification of Advances, Interest Rates, Prepayments and Commitment Reductions.  Promptly after receipt thereof, the Administrative Agent will notify each Lender of
 
27





 
the contents of each Aggregate Commitment reduction notice, Borrowing Notice, Conversion/Continuation Notice, and repayment notice received by it hereunder.  The Administrative Agent will notify each Lender of the Eurocurrency Rate applicable to each Eurocurrency Advance promptly upon determination of such interest rate and will give each Lender prompt notice of each change in the Alternate Base Rate.
 
2.17.                     Lending Installations.  Each Lender may book its Loans at any Lending Installation selected by such Lender and may change its Lending Installation from time to time, which Lending Installation may include any Affiliate of such Lender or any domestic or foreign branch of such Lender or such Affiliate.  All terms of this Agreement shall apply to any such Lending Installation and the Loans and any Notes issued hereunder shall be deemed held by each Lender for the benefit of any such Lending Installation.  Each Lender may, by written notice to the Administrative Agent and the Parent in accordance with Article XIII, designate replacement or additional Lending Installations through which Loans will be made by it will be issued by it and for whose account Loan payments are to be made.
 
2.18.                     Non-Receipt of Funds by the Administrative Agent.  Unless a Borrower or a Lender, as the case may be, notifies the Administrative Agent prior to the time at which it is scheduled to make payment to the Administrative Agent of (a) in the case of a Lender, the proceeds of a Loan, or (b) in the case of a Borrower, a payment of principal, interest or fees to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders, that it does not intend to make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such payment has been made.  The Administrative Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, make the amount of such payment available to the intended recipient in reliance upon such assumption.  If such Lender or such Borrower, as the case may be, has not in fact made such payment to the Administrative Agent, the recipient of such payment shall, on demand by the Administrative Agent, repay to the Administrative Agent the amount so made available together with interest thereon in respect of each day during the period commencing on the date such amount was so made available by the Administrative Agent until the date the Administrative Agent recovers such amount at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of payment by a Lender, (A) the Federal Funds Effective Rate in the case of Advances denominated in Dollars or (B) the cost of funds incurred by the Administrative Agent in respect of such amount in the case of Loans denominated in Committed Currencies for such day for the first three (3) days and, thereafter, the interest rate applicable to the relevant Loan or (ii) in the case of payment by a Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the relevant Loan.
 
2.19.                     Increase in the Aggregate Commitments.  (a) The Parent may, at any time but in any event not more than once in any calendar year prior to the latest Facility Termination Date, by notice to the Administrative Agent, request that the Aggregate Commitment be increased by an amount of $10,000,000 or an integral multiple thereof (each a Commitment Increase) to be effective as of a date that is at least 90 days prior to the latest scheduled Facility Termination Date then in effect (the Increase Date) as specified in the related notice to the Administrative Agent; provided, however that (i) in no event shall the aggregate amount of the Commitments at any time exceed $1,500,000,000 and (ii) on the date of any request by the Parent for a Commitment Increase and on the related Increase Date the applicable conditions set forth in Article IV shall be satisfied.
 
28





 
(b)                                 The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Lenders and such Eligible Assignees as have been identified by the Parent of a request by the Parent for a Commitment Increase, which notice shall include (i) the proposed amount of such requested Commitment Increase, (ii) the proposed Increase Date and (iii) the date by which Lenders or Eligible Assignees wishing to participate in the Commitment Increase must commit to participate in the Commitment Increase, which shall be not earlier than 15 days after the date of such notice (the Commitment Date); provided, however, that the Commitment of each such Eligible Assignee shall be in an amount of $5,000,000 or more.  Each Lender that is willing to participate in such requested Commitment Increase (each an Increasing Lender) shall, in its sole discretion, give written notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the Commitment Date of the amount by which it is willing to increase its Commitment.  Any Lender that fails to provide timely notice of its agreement to participate in the requested Commitment Increase shall be deemed to have declined to increase its Commitment.  If Increasing Lenders and Eligible Assignees notify the Administrative Agent that they are willing to increase the amount of their respective Commitments or participate in the Commitment Increase by an aggregate amount that exceeds the amount of the requested Commitment Increase, the requested Commitment Increase shall be allocated among the Increasing Lenders and such Eligible Assignees in such amounts (not in excess of the increase committed to by such Increasing Lender) as are agreed by the Parent in consultation with the Administrative Agent.
 
(c)                                  On each Increase Date, each Eligible Assignee that accepts an offer to participate in a requested Commitment Increase in accordance with Section 2.19(b) (each such Eligible Assignee and each Eligible Assignee that shall become a party hereto in accordance with Section 2.22, an Assuming Lender) shall become a Lender party to this Agreement as of such Increase Date and the Commitment of each Increasing Lender for such requested Commitment Increase shall be so increased by such amount (or by the amount allocated to such Lender pursuant to the last sentence of Section 2.19(b)) as of such Increase Date; provided, however, that the Administrative Agent shall have received on or before such Increase Date the following, each dated such date:
 
(i)                                     (A) certified copies of resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Parent or the Executive Committee of such Board approving the Commitment Increase and the corresponding modifications to this Agreement and (B) an opinion of counsel for the Parent (which may be in-house counsel), in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and its counsel;
 
(ii)                                  an assumption agreement from each Assuming Lender, if any, in form and substance satisfactory to the Parent and the Administrative Agent (each an Assumption Agreement), duly executed by such Assuming Lender, the Administrative Agent and the Parent; and
 
(iii)                               confirmation from each Increasing Lender of the increase in the amount of its Commitment in a writing satisfactory to the Parent and the Administrative Agent.
 
On each Increase Date, upon fulfillment of the conditions set forth in the immediately preceding sentence of this Section 2.19(c), the Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders (including, without limitation, each Assuming Lender) and the Parent, on or before 1:00 p.m.
 
29





 
(New York time), by telecopier, of the occurrence of the Commitment Increase to be effected on such Increase Date and shall record in the Register the relevant information with respect to each Increasing Lender and each Assuming Lender on such date.  Each Increasing Lender and each Assuming Lender shall, before 2:00 p.m. (New York time) on the Increase Date, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans to be held pro rata by the Lenders in accordance with the Commitments.
 
2.20.                     Replacement of Lender.  If (a) any Borrower is required pursuant to Section 3.1, 3.2 or 3.5 to pay any Indemnified Taxes or make any additional payment to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender, (b) any Lenders obligation to make or continue, or to convert Alternate Base Rate Advances into, Eurocurrency Advances shall be suspended pursuant to Section 3.3, (c) any Lender is a Defaulting Lender or (d) any Lender is a Non-Consenting Lender (any Lender so affected an Affected Lender), the Parent may elect, if such amounts continue to be charged or such suspension or status as a Defaulting Lender or Non-Consenting Lender is still effective, to replace such Affected Lender as a Lender party to this Agreement, provided that no Default or Unmatured Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such replacement, and provided further that, concurrently with such replacement, (i) another bank or other entity which is an Eligible Assignee shall agree, as of such date, to purchase for cash the Advances at par and other Obligations due to the Affected Lender pursuant to an assignment substantially in the form of Exhibit C and to become a Lender for all purposes under this Agreement and to assume all obligations of the Affected Lender to be terminated as of such date and to comply with the requirements of Section 12.2 applicable to assignments, and (ii) the Borrowers and/or the assignee shall pay to such Affected Lender in same day funds on the day of such replacement (A) all interest, fees and other amounts then accrued but unpaid to such Affected Lender by the Borrowers hereunder to and including the date of termination, including without limitation payments due to such Affected Lender under Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.5, and (B) an amount, if any, equal to the payment which would have been due to such Lender on the day of such replacement under Section 3.4 had the Loans of such Affected Lender been prepaid on such date rather than sold to the replacement Lender.
 
2.21.                     Defaulting Lenders.  (a)                 Defaulting Lender Adjustments.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as such Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable law:
 
(i)                                     Waivers and Amendments.  Such Defaulting Lenders right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in the definition of Required Lenders.
 
(ii)                                  Defaulting Lender Waterfall.  Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of such Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Section 8.1 or otherwise) or received by the Administrative Agent from a Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 11.1 shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder; second, as the Parent may
 
30





 
request (so long as no Default or Unmatured Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent; third, if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Parent, to be held in a deposit account and released in order to satisfy such Defaulting Lenders potential future funding obligations with respect to Loans under this Agreement; fourth, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement; fifth, so long as no Default or Unmatured Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to a Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by such Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and sixth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share, and (y) such Loans were made at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 4.3 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of all non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of such Defaulting Lender until such time as all Loans are held by the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the Commitments.  Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender pursuant to this Section 2.21 shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.
 
(iii)                               Certain Fees.  Each Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive a Facility Fee for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender only to the extent allocable to the outstanding principal amount of the Loans funded by it (and the Parent shall not be required to pay such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to such Defaulting Lender).
 
(b)                                 Defaulting Lender Cure.  If the Parent and the Administrative Agent agree in writing that a Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein, that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans to be held pro rata by the Lenders in accordance with the Commitments, whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Parent while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lenders having been a Defaulting Lender.
 
2.22.                     Extension of Facility Termination Date.  (a)     Requests for Extension.  The Parent may, by notice to the Administrative Agent (who shall promptly notify the Lenders) not earlier than 60 days and not later than 45 days prior to any anniversary of the date of this Agreement
 
31





 
(the Anniversary Date), but not more than twice, request that each Lender extend such Lenders Facility Termination Date for an additional one year from the Facility Termination Date then in effect with respect to such Lender.
 
(b)                                 Lender Elections to Extend.  Each Lender, acting in its sole and individual discretion, shall, by notice to the Administrative Agent given not earlier than 30 days prior to the applicable Anniversary Date and not later than the date (the Notice Date) that is 20 days prior to such Anniversary Date, advise the Administrative Agent whether or not such Lender agrees to such extension (and each Lender that determines not to so extend its Facility Termination Date (a Non-Extending Lender) shall notify the Administrative Agent of such fact promptly after such determination (but in any event no later than the Notice Date) and any Lender that does not so advise the Administrative Agent on or before the Notice Date shall be deemed to be a Non-Extending Lender).  The election of any Lender to agree to such extension shall not obligate any other Lender to so agree.
 
(c)                                  Notification by Agent.  The Administrative Agent shall notify the Parent of each Lenders determination under this Section no later than the date 15 days prior to the applicable Anniversary Date (or, if such date is not a Business Day, on the next preceding Business Day).
 
(d)                                 Additional Commitment Lenders.  The Parent shall have the right on or before the applicable Anniversary Date to replace each Non-Extending Lender with, and add as Lenders under this Agreement in place thereof, one or more Eligible Assignees (as an Assuming Lender), each of which Assuming Lenders shall have entered into an Assumption Agreement pursuant to which such Assuming Lender shall, effective as of the applicable Anniversary Date, undertake a Commitment (and, if any such Assuming Lender is already a Lender, its Commitment shall be in addition to such Lenders Commitment hereunder on such date).
 
(e)                                  Minimum Extension Requirement; Conditions to Effectiveness of Extensions.  If (and only if) the total of the Commitments of the Lenders that have agreed to extend their Facility Termination Date and the additional Commitments of the Assuming Lenders shall be more than 50% of the Aggregate Commitment in effect immediately prior to the applicable Anniversary Date, then, effective as of such Anniversary Date, the Facility Termination Date of each extending Lender and of each Assuming Lender shall be extended to the date falling one year after the Facility Termination Date in effect for such Lenders (except that, if such date is not a Business Day, such Facility Termination Date as so extended shall be the next preceding Business Day) and each Assuming Lender shall thereupon become a Lender for all purposes of this Agreement; provided, however on the date of any request by the Parent for an extension of the Facility Termination Date and on the related Anniversary Date the applicable conditions set forth in Article IV shall be satisfied.
 
ARTICLE III YIELD PROTECTION; TAXES
 
3.1.                            Yield Protection.  If any Change in Law:
 
32





 
(a)                                 subjects any Lender to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (ii) through (iv) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) in respect of its Eurocurrency Loans, or
 
(b)                                 imposes or increases or deems applicable any reserve, assessment, compulsory loan, insurance charge, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation (other than reserves and assessments taken into account in determining the interest rate applicable to Eurocurrency Advances), or
 
(c)                                  imposes any other condition the result of which is to increase the cost (other than Taxes) to any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation of making, funding, continuing, converting into or maintaining its Eurocurrency Loans, or reduces any amount receivable by any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation in connection with its Eurocurrency Loans, or requires any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation to make any payment calculated by reference to the amount of Eurocurrency Loans, held or interest received by it, by an amount deemed material by such Lender,
 
and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender or applicable Lending Installation of making, funding, continuing, converting into or maintaining its Eurocurrency Loans or Commitment or to reduce the return received by such Lender or applicable Lending Installation in connection with such Eurocurrency Loans or Commitment, then, within fifteen (15) days of demand by such Lender as provided in Section 3.6, the Parent or the applicable Borrower shall pay such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduction in amount received.
 
3.2.                            Changes in Capital or Liquidity Requirements.  If a Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender, any Lending Installation of such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lenders capital or the capital of such Lending Installation of such Lender or such corporation controlling such Lender as a consequence of this Agreement, its Outstanding Credit Exposure or its Commitment to make Loans hereunder to a level below that which could have been achieved but for such Change in Law (after taking into account such Lenders policies as to capital adequacy), then, within fifteen (15) days of demand by such Lender as provided in Section 3.6, the Parent or the applicable Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount necessary to compensate for any such reduction.
 
3.3.                            Availability of Types of Advances.  If any Lender determines that maintenance of its Eurocurrency Loans at a suitable Lending Installation would violate any applicable law, rule, regulation, interpretation or directive, whether or not having the force of law, if the Administrative Agent determines that the Eurocurrency Base Rate cannot be determined by reference to any generally recognized financial information service or if the Required Lenders determine that (a) deposits of a type and maturity appropriate to match fund Eurocurrency Advances are not available or (b) the interest rate applicable to Eurocurrency Advances does not accurately or fairly reflect the cost of making or maintaining Eurocurrency Advances, then the Administrative Agent shall suspend the availability of Eurocurrency Advances and require any
 
33





 
affected Eurocurrency Advances, if denominated in Dollars. to be repaid or converted to Alternate Base Rate Advances or, if denominated in a Committed Currency, to be repaid or exchanged for an Equivalent amount of Dollars and converted to Alternate Base Rate Advances, in each case subject to the payment of any funding indemnification amounts required by Section 3.4.
 
3.4.                            Funding Indemnification.  If (a) any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of a Eurocurrency Advance occurs on a date other than the last day of the applicable Interest Period (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise), (b) a Borrower fails (for a reason other than the failure of a Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert a Eurocurrency Advance on the date or in the amount notified by such Borrower or (c) any assignment of a Eurocurrency Loan occurs on a day other than the last day of the applicable Interest Period as a result of a request by the Parent pursuant to Section 2.20, the Parent or the applicable Borrower will indemnify each Lender for any loss or cost incurred by it resulting therefrom, including, without limitation, any loss or cost in liquidating or employing deposits acquired to fund or maintain such Eurocurrency Advance but excluding loss of Applicable Margin.
 
3.5.                            Taxes.  (a) Subject to applicable law, all payments by any Loan Party to or for the account of any Lender or the Administrative Agent hereunder or under any Note shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any and all Taxes.  Subject to subsection (e) below and Section 3.6, if any Loan Party shall be required by law (as determined in its good faith discretion) to deduct any Tax from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder to any Lender or the Administrative Agent, (i) if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 3.5) such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Loan Party shall make such deductions, (iii) such Loan Party shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law and (iv) such Loan Party shall furnish to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent, within thirty (30) days after such payment is made.
 
(b)                                 In addition, the Loan Parties hereby agree to pay any present or future stamp, court or documentary, intangible, recording, filing or similar Taxes that arise from any payment made under, from the execution, delivery, performance, enforcement or registration of, or from the receipt or perfection of a security interest under this Agreement or any Note, except any such Taxes that are Other Connection Taxes imposed with respect to an assignment (other than an assignment made pursuant to Section 2.20) (Other Taxes).
 
(c)                                  The Loan Parties hereby agree to indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including any Indemnified Taxes imposed on amounts payable under this Section 3.5) paid by the Administrative Agent or such Lender and any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto.  Payments due under this indemnification shall be made within thirty (30) days of the date the Administrative Agent or such Lender makes demand therefor pursuant to Section 3.6.
 
34





 
(d)                                 (i)                                     Any Lender or Administrative Agent that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to each Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by any Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by any Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding.  In addition, any Lender or Administrative Agent, if reasonably requested by any Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by any Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not it is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Sections 3.5(d)(ii)(A), 3.5(d)(ii)(B) and 3.5(d)(ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lenders or Administrative Agents reasonable judgment, as applicable, such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender or Administrative Agent to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender or Administrative Agent.
 
(ii)                                  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
 
(A)             each Lender and Administrative Agent that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to each U.S. Borrower and the Administrative Agent, on or prior to the date it becomes a party to this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of any U.S. Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that it is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax;
 
(B)             each Non-U.S. Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the U.S. Borrowers and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient), on or prior to the date on which it becomes a party to this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of any U.S. Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:
 
(i)                               in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the interest article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the business profits or other income article of such tax treaty;
 
35





 
(ii)                            executed originals of IRS Form W-8ECI or W-8EXP;
 
(iii)                         in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit F-1 to the effect that such Non-U.S. Lender is not a bank within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a 10-percent shareholder of any U.S. Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a controlled foreign corporation described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate) and (y) executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E; or
 
(iv)                        to the extent a Non-U.S. Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed originals of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit F-2 or Exhibit F-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Non-U.S. Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Non-U.S. Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Non-U.S. Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit F-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner;
 
(C)             any Non-U.S. Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the U.S. Borrowers and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which it becomes a party to this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of any U.S. Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed copies of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the U.S. Borrowers or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and
 
(D)             if a payment made to a Lender or the Administrative Agent under this Agreement or any other Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax imposed by FATCA if it were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender or Administrative Agent shall deliver to the U.S. Borrowers and the Administrative Agent at the time or times
 
36





 
prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by any U.S. Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by any U.S. Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the U.S. Borrowers and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender or Administrative Agent has complied with such Lenders or Administrative Agents obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.  Solely for purposes of this clause (D), FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
 
Each Lender and the Administrative Agent agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.
 
(e)                                  In the case of an Advance by a Lender to a UK Borrower:
 
(i) A UK Treaty Lender and each Loan Party which makes a payment to which that UK Treaty Lender is entitled under such Advance to a UK Borrower shall co-operate in completing any procedural formalities necessary for that Loan Party to obtain authorization to make that payment without a deduction or withholding for or on account of Tax including submitting written applications, making and filing an application for relief under a double tax treaty and otherwise complying with the requirements of the relevant tax authority.
 
(ii)                                  (A)                               A UK Treaty Lender which becomes a Party on the day on which this Agreement is entered into which holds a passport under the HMRC DT Treaty Passport Scheme and which desires that such scheme applies to this Agreement shall on or before the date of this Agreement indicate to the Administrative Agent that it wishes the scheme to apply to a Loan to a UK Borrower under this Agreement and provide the Administrative Agent with its scheme reference number and its jurisdiction of tax residence (and the Administrative Agent shall, without unreasonable delay, notify the relevant UK Borrower of the same); and
 
(B)                               A UK Treaty Lender which becomes a Party after the day on which this Agreement is entered into which holds a passport under the HMRC DT Treaty Passport Scheme and which desires that such scheme applies to this Agreement, shall indicate to the Administrative Agent that it wishes the scheme to apply to an Advance to a UK Borrower under this Agreement and provide the Administrative Agent with its scheme reference number and its jurisdiction of tax residence in the Assumption Agreement or the Assignment and Assumption which it executes,
 
37





 
and having done so, that UK Treaty Lender shall, subject to Section 3.5(i)(ii), be under no obligation pursuant to paragraph (e)(i) above.
 
(f)                                   If HM Revenue & Customs or any other Governmental Authority of the United Kingdom, the IRS or any other Governmental Authority of the United States or any other country or any political subdivision thereof asserts a claim that the Administrative Agent did not properly withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender (because such Lender was not a UK Qualifying Lender, the appropriate form was not delivered or properly completed, because such Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in circumstances which rendered its exemption from withholding ineffective, or for any other reason not caused by or constituting gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Administrative Agent), such Lender shall indemnify the Administrative Agent fully for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the Administrative Agent as tax, withholding therefor, or otherwise, including penalties and interest, and including taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable to the Administrative Agent under this subsection, together with all reasonable costs and expenses related thereto (including reasonable attorneys fees and reasonable time charges of attorneys for the Administrative Agent, which attorneys may be employees of the Administrative Agent).  The obligations of the Lenders under this Section 3.5(f) shall survive the payment of the Obligations and termination of this Agreement.
 
(g)                                  In the case of an Advance to a UK Borrower, a UK Non-Bank Lender shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent if there is any change in the position from that set out in the UK Tax Confirmation.
 
(h)                                 In the case of an Advance to a UK Borrower, each Lender which becomes a party to this Agreement after the date hereof shall indicate in the Assumption Agreement or Assignment and Assumption that it executes on becoming a party hereto, and for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and without liability to any Loan Party which of the following categories it constitutes (in relation to such UK Borrower):
 
(i) not a UK Qualifying Lender;
 
(ii) a UK Qualifying Lender (other than a UK Treaty Lender); or
 
(iii) a UK Treaty Lender.
 
If a Lender fails to indicate its status in accordance with this paragraph (h) then such Lender shall be treated for the purposes of this Agreement by the Administrative Agent and each Loan Party as if it was not a UK Qualifying Lender until such time as it notifies the Administrative Agent which category applies (and the Administrative Agent upon receipt of such notification, shall inform the relevant UK Borrower).  For the avoidance of doubt, an Assumption Agreement or Assignment and Assumption shall not be invalidated by any failure of a Lender to comply with this paragraph (h).
 
(i)                                     HMRC DT Treaty Passport Scheme.
 
(i) If a UK Treaty Lender has confirmed its scheme reference number and its jurisdiction of tax residence in accordance with Section 3.5(e)(ii) above, the UK
 
38





 
Borrower shall make a UK Borrower DTTP Filing and shall promptly deliver a copy of that filing to the relevant UK Treaty Lender.
 
(ii) If a Lender has confirmed its scheme reference number and its jurisdiction of tax residence in accordance with Section 3.5(e)(ii) above and: (a) a UK Borrower making a payment to that Lender has not made a UK Borrower DTTP Filing in respect of that Lender, or (b) a UK Borrower making a payment to that Lender has made a UK Borrower DTTP Filing in respect of that Lender but: (1) that UK Borrower DTTP Filing has been rejected by HM Revenue & Customs, or (2) HM Revenue & Customs has not given the UK Borrower authority to make payments to that Lender without a deduction or withholding for or on account of Tax within 60 days of the date of the UK Borrower DTTP Filing, and in each of cases (a) and (b) (as applicable), the UK Borrower has notified that Lender in writing, that Lender and the UK Borrower shall, pursuant to Section 3.5(e)(i), co-operate in completing any additional procedural formalities necessary for that UK Borrower to obtain authorization to make that payment without a withholding or deduction for or on account of Tax.
 
(iii) If a UK Treaty Lender has not confirmed its scheme reference number and jurisdiction of tax residence in accordance with Section 3.5(e)(ii) above, no UK Borrower shall make a UK Borrower DTTP Filing or file any other form relating to the HMRC DT Treaty Passport scheme in respect of that Lenders Commitment or its participation in any Loan unless the UK Treaty Lender otherwise agrees.
 
(j)                                    If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 3.5 (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section 3.5), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph (j) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (j), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph (j) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid.  This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.
 
3.6.                            Lender Statements; Survival of Indemnity.  To the extent reasonably possible, each Lender shall designate an alternate Lending Installation with respect to its Loans to reduce any liability of the Loan Parties to such Lender under Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.5 or to avoid the
 
39





 
unavailability of Eurocurrency Advances under Section 3.3, so long as such designation is not, in the judgment of such Lender, disadvantageous to such Lender.  Each Lender shall deliver a written statement of such Lender to the Parent (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) as to the amount due, if any, under Section 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 or 3.5.  Such written statement shall set forth in reasonable detail the calculations upon which such Lender determined such amount and shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Parent in the absence of demonstrable error.  If any Lender fails to deliver such written statement in respect of claims made under Section 3.1, 3.2 or 3.4 within 180 days after the date on which such Lender becomes aware of the event or occurrence giving rise to such claim, and in respect of claims made under Section 3.5(a), (b) or (c), within 180 days after the date any amount is paid by such Lender or such Lender receives actual written notice of a proposed assessment, the Loan Parties shall have no obligation to reimburse, compensate or indemnify such Lender with respect to any such claim under this Article III for any period more than 180 days before the date on which such statement is delivered (except that, if such change, event or occurrence giving rise to such claim is retroactive, then the 180 day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).  Determination of amounts payable under such Sections in connection with a Eurocurrency Loan shall be calculated as though each Lender funded its Eurocurrency Loan through the purchase of a deposit of the type and maturity corresponding to the deposit used as a reference in determining the Eurocurrency Rate applicable to such Loan, whether in fact that is the case or not.  Unless otherwise provided herein, the amount specified in the written statement of any Lender shall be payable on demand after receipt by the Parent of such written statement.  The obligations of each party under Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 and 3.5 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments, and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of the Obligations under any Loan Document and termination of this Agreement.  This Section 3.6 shall not be construed to require any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to the Parent or any other Person.

8.2.                            Amendments.  No Loan Document, nor any provision thereof may be waived, amended or modified except that, subject to the provisions of this Article VIII, the Required Lenders (or the Administrative Agent with the consent in writing of the Required Lenders) and the Parent may enter into agreements supplemental hereto for the purpose of adding or modifying any provisions to the Loan Documents or changing in any manner the rights of the Lenders or the Borrowers hereunder or thereunder or waiving any Default or Unmatured Default hereunder or thereunder; provided, however, that no such supplemental agreement shall, without the consent of each Lender directly affected thereby:
 
(a)                                 Extend the Facility Termination Date with respect to such Lender, compromise or forgive the principal amount of any Loan, or reduce the rate of interest or compromise or forgive payment of interest on any Loan, or reduce the amount of, or compromise or forgive payment of, any fee payable hereunder;

(c)                                  Increase the amount of the Commitment of any Lender hereunder;
 
59

In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 8.2, this Agreement and the other Loan Documents may be amended and waived with the consent of the Administrative Agent at the request of the Parent without the need to obtain the consent of any other Lender if such amendment or waiver is delivered in order (i) to comply with local Law or advice of local counsel, (ii) to cure ambiguities or defects or (iii) to cause such other Loan Documents to be consistent with this Agreement and, in each case, the impact of such amendment or waiver on the Lenders is de minimus.
 
8.3.                            Preservation of Rights.  No delay or omission of the Lenders or the Administrative Agent to exercise any right under the Loan Documents shall impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of any Default or an acquiescence therein, and the making of a Credit Extension notwithstanding the existence of a Default or the inability of any Borrower to satisfy the conditions precedent to such Credit Extension shall not constitute any waiver or acquiescence.  Any single or partial exercise of any such right shall not preclude other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, and no waiver, amendment or other variation of the terms, conditions or provisions of the Loan Documents whatsoever shall be valid unless in writing signed by the Lenders required pursuant to Section 8.2, and then only to the extent in such writing specifically set forth.  All remedies contained in the Loan Documents or by law afforded shall be cumulative and all shall be available to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders until the Obligations have been paid in full.

9.5.                            Several Obligations; Benefits of this Agreement.  The respective obligations of the Lenders hereunder are several and not joint and no Lender shall be the partner or agent of any other (except to the extent to which the Administrative Agent is authorized to act as such).  The failure of any Lender to perform any of its obligations hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender from any of its obligations hereunder.  This Agreement shall not be construed so as to confer any right or benefit upon any Person other than the parties to this Agreement and their respective successors and assigns; provided, however, that the parties hereto expressly agree that each of the Arrangers shall enjoy the benefits of the provisions of Sections 9.6, 9.10 and 10.09 to the extent specifically set forth therein and shall have the right to enforce such provisions on its own behalf and in its own name to the same extent as if it were a party to this Agreement.
 
9.6.                            Expenses; Indemnification.  The Parent shall reimburse the Administrative Agent and the Arrangers for any out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable and reasonably documented attorneys fees and time charges of one primary counsel and, if reasonably necessary, one local counsel in each relevant jurisdiction material to the interests of the Lenders taken as a whole (which may be a single counsel acting in multiple material jurisdictions) for the Administrative Agent or the Arrangers) paid or incurred by the Administrative Agent or the Arrangers in connection with the preparation, negotiation, execution, delivery, syndication, distribution (including, without limitation, via the internet), review, amendment, modification, and administration of the Loan Documents.  The Parent also agrees to reimburse the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers and the Lenders for any costs, internal charges and out-of-pocket expenses (including attorneys fees and time charges of attorneys for the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers and the Lenders, which attorneys may be employees of the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers or the Lenders) paid or incurred by the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers or any Lender in connection with the collection of the Obligations or the enforcement of the Loan Documents.  The Parent further agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers and each Lender, their respective affiliates, and each of their partners, trustees, administrators, advisors, agents, directors, officers and employees against all losses, claims, damages, penalties, judgments, liabilities and expenses (including, without limitation, all expenses of litigation or preparation therefor whether or not the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers or any Lender or any affiliate is a party thereto and whether brought by the Parent or any other Person) which any of them may pay or incur arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, the transactions contemplated hereby, or the direct or indirect application or proposed application of the proceeds of any Credit Extension hereunder except to the extent that they are determined in a final non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of the party seeking indemnification.  This Section 9.6 shall supersede any and all
 
61





 
indemnification provisions entered into before the date hereof among the Parent and the Administrative Agent, any Arrangers and any Lenders.  The obligations of the Parent under this Section 9.6 shall survive the termination of this Agreement.  This Section 9.6 shall not apply with respect to Taxes other than any Taxes that represent losses, claims, damages, etc. arising from any non-Tax claim.
 
9.7.                                    Judgments.  If for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder in Dollars or any other Committed Currency (the Judgment Currency) into a different currency (the Other Currency), the parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent they may effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Administrative Agent could purchase the Judgment Currency with such Other Currency at the spot rate of exchange quoted by the Administrative Agent at 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is given (or such other rate as may be required by any applicable Law), for the purchase of the Judgment Currency, for delivery two Business Days thereafter.
 
9.8.                            Accounting.  Except as provided to the contrary herein, all accounting terms used herein shall be interpreted and all accounting determinations hereunder shall be made in accordance with Agreement Accounting Principles.
 
9.9.                            Severability of Provisions.  Any provision in any Loan Document that is held to be inoperative, unenforceable, or invalid in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be inoperative, unenforceable, or invalid without affecting the remaining provisions in that jurisdiction or the operation, enforceability, or validity of that provision in any other jurisdiction, and to this end the provisions of all Loan Documents are declared to be severable.
 
9.10.                     Nonliability of Lenders.  The relationship between the Borrowers on the one hand and the Lenders and the Administrative Agent on the other hand shall be solely that of borrower and lender.  None of the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers or any Lender shall have any fiduciary responsibilities to any Loan Party.  None of the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers or any Lender undertakes any responsibility to any Loan Party to review or inform any Loan Party of any matter in connection with any phase of any Loan Partys business or operations.  None of the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers or any Lender shall have any liability with respect to, and each Loan Party hereby waives, releases and agrees not to sue for, any special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages suffered by such Loan Party in connection with, arising out of, or in any way related to the Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated thereby, including use by unintended recipients of information distributed electronically as provided herein.
 
9.11.                     Confidentiality.  Each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its Affiliates and to its and its Affiliates respective managers, administrators, trustees, partners, directors, officers, employees, agents, advisors and other representatives, and third party settlement providers (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority purporting to have jurisdiction over it or its Affiliates (including any self-regulatory authority, such as the
 
62





 
National Association of Insurance Commissioners), (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to any other party hereto, (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or under any Note or any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any Note or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions no less restrictive than those of this Section, to (i) any assignee of or participant in, or any prospective assignee of or participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement, (ii) any actual or prospective party (or its managers, administrators, trustees, partners, directors, officers, employees, agents, advisors and other representatives) to any swap, derivative or other transaction under which payments are to be made by reference to any Loan Party and its obligations, this Agreement or payments hereunder, (iii) any rating agency, or (iv) the CUSIP Service Bureau or any similar organization, (g) with the consent of the Parent or (h) to the extent such Information (x) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section or (y) becomes available to the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any of their respective Affiliates on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than any Loan Party.
 
For purposes of this Section, Information means all information received from any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries relating to any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective businesses, including information received prior to the date of this Agreement, other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries.  Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information.
 
Without limiting Section 9.4, each Loan Party agrees that the terms of this Section 9.11 shall set forth the entire agreement between the Loan Parties and each Lender (including the Administrative Agent) with respect to any confidential information previously or hereafter received by such Lender in connection with this Agreement, and this Section 9.11 shall supersede any and all prior confidentiality agreements entered into by such Lender with respect to such confidential information.
 
9.12.                     Disclosure.  Each Loan Party and each Lender hereby acknowledge and agree that Citibank and/or its Affiliates from time to time may hold investments in, make other loans to or have other relationships with any Loan Party and its Affiliates.
 
9.13.                             USA PATRIOT ACT NOTIFICATION.  Each Lender hereby notifies each Loan Party that pursuant to the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (title III of Pub.L.107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)) (the Act), it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies such Loan Party, which information includes the name and address of such Loan Party and other information that will allow such Lender to identify such Loan Party in accordance with the Act.  The Parent shall provide such information promptly upon the request of a Lender.

ARTICLE X THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT
 
10.1.                     Appointment and Authority.  Each Lender hereby irrevocably appoints Citibank, N.A. to act on its behalf as the Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.  Other than Sections 10.6 and 10.10, the provisions of this Article are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and the Loan Parties shall have no rights as a third party beneficiary of any of such provisions.  It is understood and agreed that the use of the term agent herein or in any other Loan Documents (or any other similar term) with reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law.  Instead such term is used as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting parties.
 
10.2.                     Rights as a Lender.  The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and the term Lender or Lenders shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity.  Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, own securities of, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for, and generally engage in any kind of business with, any Loan Party or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.
 
10.3.                     Exculpatory Provisions.  (a) The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, and its duties hereunder shall be administrative in nature.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent:
 
(i)                                     shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default or Unmatured Default has occurred and is continuing;
 
(ii)                                  shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents); provided that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law, including for the avoidance of doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any Debtor Relief Law or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any Debtor Relief Law; and
 
64





 
(iii)                               shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to any Loan Party or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.
 
(b)                                 The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Sections 8.1 or 8.2), or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment.  The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default or Unmatured Default unless and until notice describing such Default or Unmatured Default is given to the Administrative Agent in writing by any Loan Party or any Lender.
 
(c)                                  The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default or Unmatured Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.
 
10.4.                     Reliance by Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person.  The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon.  In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender prior to the making of such Loan.  The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Loan Parties), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
 
10.5.                     Delegation of Duties.  The Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties.  The exculpatory provisions of this Article
 
65





 
shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the Commitments as well as activities as Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any sub-agents except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and nonappealable judgment that the Administrative Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such sub-agents.
 
10.6.                     Resignation of Administrative Agent.  (a) The Administrative Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders and the Parent.  Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, with the consent of the Parent unless a Default has occurred and is continuing (and otherwise in consultation with the Parent), to appoint a successor, which shall be a commercial bank having capital and retained earnings of at least $100,000,000 with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States.  If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the Resignation Effective Date), then the retiring Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to), on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above.  Whether or not a successor has been appointed, such resignation shall become effective in accordance with such notice on the Resignation Effective Date.
 
(b)                                 If the Person serving as Administrative Agent is a Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (d) of the definition thereof, the Required Lenders may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, by notice in writing to the Parent and such Person remove such Person as Administrative Agent and, with the consent of the Parent unless a Default has occurred and is continuing (and otherwise in consultation with the Parent), appoint a successor.  If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the Removal Effective Date), then such removal shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice on the Removal Effective Date.
 
(c)                                  With effect from the Resignation Effective Date or the Removal Effective Date (as applicable) (1) the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and (2) except for any indemnity payments owed to the retiring or removed Administrative Agent, all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender directly, until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided for above.  Upon the acceptance of a successors appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring or removed Administrative Agent (other than any rights to indemnity payments owed to the retiring or removed Administrative Agent), and the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents.  The fees payable by the Parent to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Parent and such successor.  After the retiring or removed Administrative Agents resignation or removal
 
66





 
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article and Sections 9.6 and 9.10 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring or removed Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring or removed Administrative Agent was acting as Administrative Agent.
 
10.7.                     Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Lenders.  Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement.  Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.
 
10.8.                     Administrative Agents Reimbursement and Indemnification.  The Lenders severally agree to reimburse and indemnify the Administrative Agent (to the extent not promptly reimbursed by the Parent) ratably in proportion to their respective Commitments (or, if the Commitments have been terminated, in proportion to their Commitments immediately prior to such termination) (i) for any expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders, in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration and enforcement of the Loan Documents (including, without limitation, for any expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent in connection with any dispute between the Administrative Agent and any Lender or between two or more of the Lenders) and (iii) for any liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind and nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent in any way relating to or arising out of the Loan Documents or any other document delivered in connection therewith or the transactions contemplated thereby (including, without limitation, for any such amounts incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent in connection with any dispute between the Administrative Agent and any Lender or between two or more of the Lenders), or the enforcement of any of the terms of the Loan Documents or of any such other documents, provided that (A) no Lender shall be liable for any of the foregoing to the extent any of the foregoing is found in a final non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Administrative Agent and (B) any indemnification required pursuant to Section 3.5(f) shall, notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 10.8, be paid by the relevant Lender in accordance with the provisions thereof.  The obligations of the Lenders under this Section 10.8 shall survive payment of the Obligations and termination of this Agreement.
 
10.9.                     No Other Duties, etc.  None of the Lenders (or affiliates of Lenders) identified in this Agreement as the Syndication Agent or Arrangers or Joint Bookrunners or Documentation Agents shall have any right, power, obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this Agreement in such identified capacity other than those (in the case of those who are Lenders) applicable to all Lenders as such.  Without limiting the foregoing, none of such Lenders (or affiliates of Lenders) shall have or be deemed to have a fiduciary relationship with any
 
67





 
Lender.  Each Lender hereby makes the same acknowledgments with respect to such Lenders (and such affiliates) as it makes with respect to the Administrative Agent in Section 10.7.
 
10.10.                      Fees.  The Parent agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent and Citigroup Global Markets Inc., for their respective accounts, the fees agreed to by the Parent, the Administrative Agent and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. pursuant to that certain letter agreement dated January 5, 2015, or as otherwise agreed in writing from time to time.
 
ARTICLE XI SETOFF; RATABLE PAYMENTS
 
11.1.                     Setoff.  If a Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender and each its Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, in whatever currency) at any time held, and other obligations (in whatever currency) at any time owing, by such Lender or any such Affiliate, to or for the credit or the account of the Parent or any other Loan Party against any and all of the obligations of the Parent or such Loan Party now or hereafter existing under this Agreement or any other Loan Document to such Lender or its Affiliates, irrespective of whether or not such Lender or Affiliate shall have made any demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and although such obligations of the Parent or such Loan Party may be contingent or unmatured or are owed to a branch, office or Affiliate of such Lender different from the branch, office or Affiliate holding such deposit or obligated on such indebtedness; provided that in the event that any Defaulting Lender shall exercise any such right of setoff, (x) all amounts so set off shall be paid over immediately to the Administrative Agent for further application in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.21 and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and (y) the Defaulting Lender shall provide promptly to the Administrative Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the Obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as to which it exercised such right of setoff.  The rights of each Lender and its Affiliates under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that such Lender or its Affiliates may have.  Each Lender agrees to notify the Parent and the Administrative Agent promptly after any such setoff and application; provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application.
 
11.2.                     Ratable Payments.  If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans or other obligations hereunder resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and accrued interest thereon or other such obligations greater than its pro rata share thereof as provided herein, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and such other obligations of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and other amounts owing them; provided that:
 
68





 
(i)                                     if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price promptly restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and
 
(ii)                                  the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by the Borrowers pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender), or (y) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the Parent or any Subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply).
 
Each Loan Party consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against each Loan Party rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of each Loan Party in the amount of such participation.
 
ARTICLE XII BENEFIT OF AGREEMENT; ASSIGNMENTS; PARTICIPATIONS
 
12.1.                     Successors and Assigns Generally.  The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that neither the Parent nor any other Loan Party may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and each Lender, and no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder except (i) to an assignee in accordance with the provisions of Section 12.2, (ii) by way of participation in accordance with the provisions of Section 12.4, or (iii) by way of pledge or assignment of a security interest subject to the restrictions of Section 12.5 (and any other attempted assignment or transfer by any party hereto shall be null and void).  Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants to the extent provided in Section 12.4 and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.
 
12.2.                     Assignments by Lenders.  Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it); provided unless a Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of such assignment, no Lender or other assignee shall acquire rights under any such assignment that would cause the Commitment of such Lender or assignee to be greater than 20% of the Aggregate Commitment; provided further that any such assignment shall be subject to the following conditions:
 
69





 
(i)                                     Minimum Amounts.
 
(A) in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lenders Commitment and/or the Loans at the time owing to it or contemporaneous assignments to related Approved Funds that equal at least the amount specified in paragraph (i)(B) of this Section in the aggregate or in the case of an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund, no minimum amount need be assigned; and
 
(B) in any case not described in paragraph (i)(A) of this Section, the aggregate amount of the Commitment (which for this purpose includes Loans outstanding thereunder) or, if the applicable Commitment is not then in effect, the principal outstanding balance of the Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if Trade Date is specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade Date) shall not be less than $5,000,000 unless each of the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Default has occurred and is continuing, the Parent otherwise consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).
 
(ii)                                  Proportionate Amounts.  Each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Loan or the Commitment assigned.
 
(iii)                               Required Consents.  No consent shall be required for any assignment except to the extent required by paragraph (i)(B) of this Section and, in addition:
 
(A) the consent of the Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) shall be required unless (x) a Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of such assignment, or (y) such assignment is to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund with respect to such Lender; provided that the Parent shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment unless it shall object thereto by written notice to the Administrative Agent within ten Business Days after having received notice thereof (including the Administrative Agents confirmation by telephone that the Parent has received such notice); and
 
(B) the consent of the Administrative Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) shall be required unless such assignment is to a Lender, an Affiliate of such Lender or an Approved Fund with respect to such Lender;
 
(iv)                              Assignment and Assumption.  The parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500; provided that the Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, elect to waive such processing and recordation fee in the case of any assignment.  The assignee, if it is not a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire.
 
70





 
(v)                                 No Assignment to Certain Persons.  No such assignment shall be made to (A) the Parent or any of the Parents Affiliates or Subsidiaries or (B) to any Defaulting Lender or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Person who, upon becoming a Lender hereunder, would constitute any of the foregoing Persons described in this clause (B).
 
(vi)                              No Assignment to Natural Persons.  No such assignment shall be made to a natural Person (or a holding company, investment vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated for the primary benefit of, a natural Person).
 
(vii)                           Certain Additional Payments.  In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments to the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with the consent of the Parent and the Administrative Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Loans previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent and each other Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon), and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro rata share of all Loans in accordance with its pro rata share.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under applicable law without compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs.
 
Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 12.3, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.5 and Sections 9.6 and 9.10 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment; provided, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no assignment by a Defaulting Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lenders having been a Defaulting Lender.  Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this paragraph shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with Section 12.4.
 
12.3.                     Register.  The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrowers, shall maintain at one of its offices in the United States a copy of each Assignment and Assumption and each Assumption Agreement delivered to it and a register for the
 
71





 
recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts (and stated interest) of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the Register).  The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent demonstrable error, and the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement.  The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrowers and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
 
12.4.                     Participations.  Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, the Parent or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural Person or a holding company, investment vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated for the primary benefit of, a natural Person or the Parent or any of the Parents Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a Participant) in all or a portion of such Lenders rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans owing to it); provided that (i) such Lenders obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, and (iii) the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement.  For the avoidance of doubt, each Lender shall be responsible for the indemnity under Section 10.8 with respect to any payments made by such Lender to its Participant(s).
 
Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver which would require consent of all of the affected Lenders pursuant to the terms of Section 8.2 or of any other Loan Document that affects such Participant.  The Borrowers agree that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 and 3.5 (subject to the requirements and limitations therein, including the requirements under Section 3.5(d) (it being understood that the documentation required under Section 3.5(d) shall be delivered to the participating Lender)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to Section 12.2; provided that such Participant (A) agrees to be subject to the provisions of Sections 2.20 and 3.6 as if it were an assignee under Section 12.2; and (B) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 3.1, 3.2 or 3.5, with respect to any participation, than its participating Lender would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation.  Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at the Parents request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Parent to effectuate the provisions of Section 2.20 with respect to any Participant.  To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 11.1 as though it were a Lender; provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 11.2 as though it were a Lender.  Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrowers, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participants interest in the Loans or other
 
72





 
obligations under the Loan Documents (the Participant Register); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participants interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations.  The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent demonstrable error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.
 
12.5.                     Certain Pledges.  Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.
 
12.6.                     Competitors.  (i)  No assignment or participation shall be made to any Person that was a Competitor as of the date (the Trade Date) on which the assigning Lender entered into a binding agreement to sell and assign all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to such Person (unless the Parent has consented to such assignment in writing in its sole and absolute discretion, in which case such Person will not be considered a Competitor for the purpose of such assignment or participation).  For the avoidance of doubt, with respect to any assignee that becomes a Competitor after the applicable Trade Date (including as a result of the delivery of a notice pursuant to, and/or the expiration of the notice period referred to in, the definition of Competitor), (x) such assignee shall not retroactively be disqualified from becoming a Lender and (y) the execution by the Parent of an Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignee will not by itself result in such assignee no longer being considered a Competitor.  Any assignment in violation of this clause 12.6(i) shall not be void, but the other provisions of this Section 12.6 shall apply.
 
(ii)                                  If any assignment or participation is made to any Competitor without the Parents prior written consent in violation of clause (i) above, or if any Person becomes a Competitor after the applicable Trade Date, the Parent may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to the applicable Competitor and the Administrative Agent, (A) terminate any Commitment of such Competitor and repay all obligations of the Borrowers owing to such Competitor in connection with such Commitment and/or (B) require such Competitor to assign, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in this Section 12.2), all of its interest, rights and obligations under this Agreement to one or more Eligible Assignees at the lesser of (x) the principal amount thereof and (y) the amount that such Competitor paid to acquire such interests, rights and obligations, in each case plus accrued interest, accrued fees and all other amounts (other than principal amounts) payable to it hereunder.
 
73





 
(iii)                               Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Competitors (A) will not (x) have the right to receive information, reports or other materials provided to Lenders by the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent or any other Lender, (y) attend or participate in meetings attended by the Lenders and the Administrative Agent, or (z) access any electronic site established for the Lenders or confidential communications from counsel to or financial advisors of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders and (B) (x) for purposes of any consent to any amendment, waiver or modification of, or any action under, and for the purpose of any direction to the Administrative Agent or any Lender to undertake any action (or refrain from taking any action) under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, each Competitor will be deemed to have consented in the same proportion as the Lenders that are not Competitors consented to such matter, and (y) for purposes of voting on any for purposes of voting on any plan of reorganization or plan of liquidation pursuant to any Debtor Relief Laws (a Plan), each Competitor party hereto hereby agrees (1) not to vote on such Plan, (2) if such Competitor does vote on such Plan notwithstanding the restriction in the foregoing clause (1), such vote will be deemed not to be in good faith and shall be designated pursuant to Section 1126(e) of the Bankruptcy Code (or any similar provision in any other Debtor Relief Laws), and such vote shall not be counted in determining whether the applicable class has accepted or rejected such Plan in accordance with Section 1126(c) of the Bankruptcy Code (or any similar provision in any other Debtor Relief Laws) and (3) not to contest any request by any party for a determination by the Bankruptcy Court (or other applicable court of competent jurisdiction) effectuating the foregoing clause (2).
 
(iv)                              The Administrative Agent shall have the right, and the Parent hereby expressly authorizes the Administrative Agent, to (A) post the list of Competitors provided by the Parent and any updates thereto from time to time (collectively, the Competitor List) on the Platform, including that portion of the Platform that is designated for public side Lenders and/or (B) provide the Competitor List to each Lender requesting the same.

ARTICLE XV GUARANTY
 
15.1.                     Guaranty; Limitation of Liability.  (a)  Each Guarantor, jointly and severally, hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees, as a guaranty of payment and performance and not merely as a guaranty of collection, prompt payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by required prepayment, upon acceleration, demand or otherwise, and at all times thereafter, of any and all of the Obligations, whether for principal, interest, premiums, fees, indemnities, damages, costs, expenses or otherwise, of the Borrowers to the Lenders, the Administrative Agent or any indemnified party arising under the Loan Documents (including all renewals, extensions, amendments, refinancings and other modifications thereof and all costs, attorneys fees and expenses incurred by the Lenders, the Administrative Agent or any indemnified party in connection with the collection or enforcement thereof).  This Guaranty shall not be affected by the genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of the Obligations or any instrument or agreement evidencing any Obligations, or by any fact or circumstance relating to the Obligations which might otherwise constitute a defense to the obligations of any Guarantor under this Guaranty (other than payment thereof), and each Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any defenses it may now have or hereafter acquire in any way relating to any or all of the foregoing.  For the avoidance of doubt, the respective obligations of each Borrower are several and not joint, except to the extent such Borrower is providing a guarantee as a Guarantor.
 
(b)                                 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in clause (a) above, each Guarantor, and by its acceptance of this Guaranty, the Administrative Agent and each Lender, hereby confirms that it is the intention of all such Persons that this Guaranty, the Guaranteed Obligations and any other obligations of each Guarantor hereunder not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance for purposes of any Debtor Relief Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar avoidable or invalid transaction under foreign, federal or
 
76





 
state law to the extent applicable to this Guaranty and the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder.  To effectuate the foregoing intention, the Administrative Agent, the other Lenders and the Guarantors hereby irrevocably agree that the Guaranteed Obligations of each Guarantor under this Guaranty at any time shall be limited to the maximum amount as will result in the Guaranteed Obligations of such Guarantor under this Guaranty not constituting such fraudulent transfer or conveyance or other similarly avoidable or invalid transaction.
 
(c)                                  Each Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably agrees that in the event any payment shall be required to be made to the Administrative Agent or any Lender under this Guaranty, such Guarantor will contribute, to the maximum extent permitted by law, such amounts to the other Guarantor so as to maximize the aggregate amount paid to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders under or in respect of this Agreement.  In no event, however, shall the Administrative Agent and the Lenders be entitled to more than a single recovery.
 
15.2.                     Guaranty Absolute.  Each Guarantor guarantees that the Obligations will be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents, regardless of any Law, regulation or order now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction affecting any of such terms or the rights of the Administrative Agent or any lender with respect thereto.  The liability of each Guarantor under this Guaranty shall be irrevocable, absolute and unconditional irrespective of, and each Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any defenses, it may now have or hereafter acquire in any way relating to, any or all of the following:
 
(a)         any lack of validity or enforceability of any Loan Document or any agreement or instrument relating thereto;
 
(b)         any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Obligations under or in respect of the Loan Documents, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from any Loan Document, including, without limitation, any increase in the Obligations resulting from the extension of additional credit to any Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise;
 
(c)          any taking, release or amendment or waiver of, or consent to departure from, any other guaranty, for all or any of the Obligations;
 
(d)         any change, restructuring or termination of the corporate structure or existence of any Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries;
 
(e)          any failure of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to disclose to such Guarantor any information relating to the business, condition (financial or otherwise), operations, performance, properties or prospects of any other Loan Party now or hereafter known to the Administrative Agent or such Lender (such Guarantor waiving any duty on the part of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders to disclose such information);
 
(f)           the failure of any other Person to execute or deliver this Guaranty, any supplement to this Guaranty or any other guaranty or agreement or the release or reduction of liability of any Guarantor or other guarantor or surety with respect to the Obligations; or
 
77





 
(g)          any other circumstance or any existence of or reliance on any representation by the Administrative Agent or any Lender that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, such Guarantor or any other guarantor or surety (other than payment thereof).
 
15.3.                     Rights Of Lenders.  Each Guarantor consents and agrees that the Lenders, the Administrative Agent or any indemnified party may at any time and from time to time, without notice or demand, and without affecting the enforceability or continuing effectiveness hereof:  (a) amend, extend, renew, compromise, discharge, accelerate or otherwise change the time for payment or the terms of the Obligations or any part thereof; (b) take, hold, exchange, enforce, waive, release, fail to perfect, sell, or otherwise dispose of any security for the payment of this Guaranty or any Obligations; and (c) apply such security and direct the order or manner of sale thereof as the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in their sole discretion may determine.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Guarantor consents to the taking of, or failure to take, any action which might in any manner or to any extent vary the risks of such Guarantor under this Guaranty or which, but for this provision, might operate as a discharge of such Guarantor .
 
15.4.                     Certain Waivers and Acknowledgements.  (a)  Each Guarantor waives (i) any defense arising by reason of any disability or other defense of any Borrower, or the cessation from any cause whatsoever (including any act or omission of any Lenders, the Administrative Agent or any indemnified party) of the liability of such Borrower; (ii) any defense based on any claim that such Guarantors obligations exceed or are more burdensome than those of any Borrower; (iii) the benefit of any statute of limitations affecting such Guarantors liability hereunder; (iv) any right to proceed against any Borrower or pursue any other remedy in the power of any Lender, the Administrative Agent or any indemnified party whatsoever until the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall have received payment in full in respect of the Obligations; and (v) to the fullest extent permitted by law, any and all other defenses or benefits that may be derived from or afforded by applicable law limiting the liability of or exonerating guarantors or sureties.  Each Guarantor expressly waives all setoffs and counterclaims and all presentments, demands for payment or performance, notices of nonpayment or nonperformance, protests, notices of protest, notices of dishonor and all other notices or demands of any kind or nature whatsoever with respect to the Obligations, and all notices of acceptance of this Guaranty or of the existence, creation or incurrence of new or additional Obligations.
 
(b)                                 Each Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives any right to revoke this Guaranty and acknowledges that this Guaranty is continuing in nature and applies to all Obligations of each Borrower, whether existing now or in the future.
 
(c)                                  Each Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives (i) any defense arising by reason of any claim or defense based upon an election of remedies by the Administrative Agent or any Lender that in any manner impairs, reduces, releases or otherwise adversely affects the subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution or indemnification rights of such Guarantor or other rights of such Guarantor to proceed against any other Person and (ii) any defense based on any right of set-off or counterclaim against or in respect of the Obligations of such Guarantor hereunder.
 
78





 
(d)                                 Each Guarantor acknowledges that it will receive substantial direct and indirect benefits from the financing arrangements contemplated by the Loan Documents and that the waivers set forth in Section 15.02 and this Section 15.04 are knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits.
 
(e)                                  The waivers of each Guarantor set forth in this Section 15.04 are made to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law.
 
15.5.                     Obligations Independent.  The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder are those of primary obligor, and not merely as surety, and are independent of the Obligations, and a separate action may be brought against such Guarantor to enforce this Guaranty whether or not any Borrower or any other person or entity is joined as a party.
 
15.6.                     Subrogation.  No Guarantor shall exercise any right of subrogation, contribution, indemnity, reimbursement or similar rights with respect to any payments it makes under this Guaranty until all of the Obligations and any amounts payable under this Guaranty have been indefeasibly paid and performed in full and the Commitments are terminated.  If any amounts are paid to any Guarantor in violation of the foregoing limitation, then such amounts shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Lenders, the Administrative Agent or any indemnified party and shall forthwith be paid to the Lenders, the Administrative Agent or any indemnified party to reduce the amount of the Obligations, whether matured or unmatured.
 
15.7.                     Termination; Reinstatement.  This Guaranty is a continuing and irrevocable guaranty of all Obligations now or hereafter existing and shall remain in full force and effect until the later of (a) all Obligations and any other amounts payable under this Guaranty are indefeasibly paid in full in cash and (b) the Facility Termination Date.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Guaranty shall continue in full force and effect or be revived, as the case may be, if any payment by or on behalf of any Borrower or any Guarantor is made, or any of the Lenders or any Lender, the Administrative Agent or any indemnified party exercises its right of setoff, in respect of the Obligations and such payment or the proceeds of such setoff or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by any of the Lenders, the Administrative Agent or any indemnified party in their discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Laws or otherwise, all as if such payment had not been made or such setoff had not occurred and whether or not the Lenders, the Administrative Agent or any indemnified party are in possession of or have released this Guaranty and regardless of any prior revocation, rescission, termination or reduction.  The obligations of each Guarantor under this paragraph shall survive termination of this Guaranty.
 
15.8.                     Stay Of Acceleration.  If acceleration of the time for payment of any of the Obligations is stayed, in connection with any case commenced by or against any Borrower under any Debtor Relief Laws, or otherwise, all such amounts shall nonetheless be payable by each Guarantor immediately upon demand by the Lenders, the Administrative Agent or any indemnified party.
 
15.9.                     Condition Of Borrowers.  Each Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that it has the sole responsibility for, and has adequate means of, obtaining from the Borrowers such
 
79





 
information concerning the financial condition, business and operations of the Borrowers as such Guarantor requires, and that none of the Lenders, the Administrative Agent or any indemnified party has any duty, and such Guarantor is not relying on the Lenders, the Administrative Agent or any indemnified party at any time, to disclose to such Guarantor any information relating to the business, operations or financial condition of the Borrowers (each Guarantor waiving any duty on the part of the Lenders, the Administrative Agent or any indemnified party to disclose such information and any defense relating to the failure to provide the same).
 
15.10.              Guaranty Supplements.  Upon the execution and delivery by any Person of a guaranty supplement in substantially the form of Exhibit D hereto (each, a Guaranty Supplement), (a) such Person shall be referred to as a Additional Guarantor and shall become and be a Guarantor hereunder, and each reference in this Section to a Guarantor shall also mean and be a reference to such Additional Guarantor, and (b) each reference herein to this Guaranty, hereunder, hereof or words of like import referring to this Section, and each reference in this Agreement to the Guaranty, thereunder, thereof or words of like import referring to this Section, shall mean and be a reference to this Section as supplemented by such Guaranty Supplement.

(d)                                 Agent for Service of Process.  Each Loan Party hereby irrevocably appoints Aon Corporation as its agent for service of process with respect to all of the Loan Documents and all other related agreements to which it is a party (the Process Agent) and Aon Corporation hereby accepts such appointment as the Process Agent and hereby agrees to forward promptly to the Parent all legal process addressed to the Parent received by the Process Agent.  Each Loan Party hereby agrees that the failure of Aon Corporation to give any notice of any such service shall not impair or affect the validity of such service or of any judgment rendered in any action or proceeding based thereon.  To the extent that each Designated Subsidiary has or hereafter may acquire any immunity from jurisdiction of any court or from any legal process (whether through service or notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution, execution or otherwise) with respect to itself or its Property, each Designated Subsidiary hereby irrevocably waives such immunity in respect of its obligations under this Agreement.
 
16.3.                     Designated Subsidiaries.  (a)  Designation.  The Parent may at any time, and from time to time, upon not less than 15 Business Days notice in the case of any Subsidiary so designated after the Effective Date, notify the Administrative Agent (who shall promptly notify the Lenders) that the Parent intends to designate a Subsidiary as a Designated Subsidiary for purposes of this Agreement.  On or after the date that is 15 Business Days after such notice, upon delivery to the Administrative Agent and each Lender of a Designation Letter duly executed by the Parent and the respective Subsidiary and substantially in the form of Exhibit E hereto, such Subsidiary shall thereupon become a Designated Subsidiary for purposes of this Agreement and, as such, shall have all of the rights and obligations of a Borrower hereunder.  The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the Parents notice of such pending designation by the Parent and the identity of the respective Subsidiary.  Following the giving of any notice pursuant to this Section 16.3(a), if the designation of such Designated Subsidiary obligates the Administrative Agent or any Lender to comply with know your customer or similar identification procedures in circumstances where the necessary information is not already available to it, the Parent shall, promptly upon the request of the Administrative Agent or any Lender, supply such documentation and other evidence as is reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent or any Lender in order for the Administrative Agent or such Lender to carry out and be satisfied it has complied with the results of all necessary know your customer or other similar checks under all applicable laws and regulations.
 
If the Parent shall designate as a Designated Subsidiary hereunder any Subsidiary not organized under the laws of the United States, any State thereof or the United Kingdom and
 
81





 
Wales, any Lender may, with notice to the Administrative Agent and the Parent, fulfill its Commitment by causing an Affiliate of such Lender to act as the Lender in respect of such Designated Subsidiary.
 
As soon as practicable after receiving notice from the Parent or the Administrative Agent of the Parents intent to designate a Subsidiary as a Designated Borrower, and in any event no later than ten Business Days after the delivery of such notice, for a Designated Subsidiary that is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction other than of the United States or a political subdivision thereof, any Lender that may not legally lend to, establish credit for the account of and/or do any business whatsoever with such Designated Subsidiary, either directly or through an Affiliate of such Lender selected pursuant to the immediately preceding paragraph (a Protesting Lender) shall so notify the Parent and the Administrative Agent in writing.  With respect to each Protesting Lender, the Parent shall, effective on or before the date that such Designated Subsidiary shall have the right to borrow hereunder, either (A) notify the Administrative Agent and such Protesting Lender that the Commitments of such Protesting Lender shall be terminated; provided that such Protesting Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Advances, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Parent or the relevant Designated Subsidiary (in the case of all other amounts), or (B) cancel its request to designate such Subsidiary as a Designated Subsidiary hereunder.
 
(b)                                 Termination.  Upon the payment and performance in full of all of the indebtedness, liabilities and obligations under this Agreement and the Notes of any Designated Subsidiary then, so long as at the time no Borrowing Notice in respect of such Designated Subsidiary is outstanding, such Subsidiarys status as a Designated Subsidiary shall terminate upon notice to such effect from the Administrative Agent to the Lenders (which notice the Administrative Agent shall give promptly upon its receipt of a request therefor from the Parent).  Thereafter, the Lenders shall be under no further obligation to make any Advance hereunder to such Designated Subsidiary.
 
16.4.                     Substitution of Currency. If a change in any Committed Currency occurs pursuant to any applicable law, rule or regulation of any governmental, monetary or multi-national authority, this Agreement (including, without limitation, the definition of Eurocurrency Rate) will be amended to the extent determined by the Administrative Agent (acting reasonably and in consultation with the Parent) to be necessary to reflect the change in currency and to put the Lenders and the Borrowers in the same position, so far as possible, that they would have been in if no change in such Committed Currency had occurred.
 
82





 
16.5.                     WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.  EACH LOAN PARTY, THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND EACH LENDER HEREBY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING INVOLVING, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ANY MATTER (WHETHER SOUNDING IN TORT, CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE) IN ANY WAY ARISING OUT OF, RELATED TO, OR CONNECTED WITH ANY LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE RELATIONSHIP ESTABLISHED THEREUNDER.

Section 1.  Guaranty; Limitation of Liability.  (a)  The undersigned hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees, as a guaranty of payment and performance and not merely as a guaranty of collection, prompt payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by required prepayment, upon acceleration, demand or otherwise, and at all times thereafter, of any and all of the Obligations, whether for principal, interest, premiums, fees, indemnities, damages, costs, expenses or otherwise, of the Borrowers to the Lenders, the Administrative Agent or any indemnified party arising under the Loan Documents (including all renewals, extensions, amendments, refinancings and other modifications thereof and all costs, attorneys fees and expenses incurred by the Lenders, the Administrative Agent or any indemnified party in connection with the collection or enforcement thereof).  This Guaranty Supplement shall not be affected by the genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of the Obligations or any instrument or agreement evidencing any Obligations, or by any fact or circumstance relating to the Obligations which might otherwise constitute a defense to the obligations of the undersigned under this Guaranty Supplement (other than payment thereof), and the undersigned hereby irrevocably waives any defenses it may now have or hereafter acquire in any way relating to any or all of the foregoing.  For the avoidance of doubt, the respective obligations of each Borrower are several and not joint, except to the extent such Borrower is providing a guarantee as a Guarantor.
 
(b)                                 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in clause (a) above, the undersigned, and by its acceptance of this Guaranty Supplement, the Administrative Agent and each Lender, hereby confirms that it is the intention of all such Persons that this Guaranty
 





 
Supplement, the Guaranty, the Guaranteed Obligations and any other obligations of the undersigned hereunder and thereunder not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance for purposes of Debtor Relief Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar avoidable or invalid transaction under foreign, federal or state law to the extent applicable to this Guaranty Supplement, the Guaranty and the obligations of the undersigned hereunder and thereunder.  To effectuate the foregoing intention, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the undersigned hereby irrevocably agree that the obligations of the undersigned under this Guaranty Supplement and the Guaranty at any time shall be limited to the maximum amount as will result in the obligations of the undersigned under this Guaranty Supplement and the Guaranty not constituting such fraudulent transfer or conveyance or similarly avoidable or invalid transaction.
 
(c)                                  The undersigned hereby unconditionally and irrevocably agrees that in the event any payment shall be required to be made to the Administrative Agent or any Lender under this Guaranty Supplement or the Guaranty, the undersigned will contribute, to the maximum extent permitted by law, such amounts to each other Guarantor so as to maximize the aggregate amount paid to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders under or in respect of the Credit Agreement.  In no event, however, shall the Administrative Agent and the Lenders be entitled to more than a single recovery.
 
Section 2.  Obligations Under the Guaranty.  The undersigned hereby agrees, as of the date first above written, to be bound as a Guarantor by all of the terms and conditions of the Guaranty to the same extent as each of the other Guarantors thereunder.  The undersigned further agrees, as of the date first above written, that each reference in the Guaranty to an Additional Guarantor or a Guarantor shall also mean and be a reference to the undersigned, and each reference in any other Loan Document to a Guarantor or a Loan Party shall also mean and be a reference to the undersigned.
 
Section 3.  Execution in Counterparts.  This Guaranty Supplement may be executed in any number of counterparts, all of which taken together shall constitute one agreement, and any of the parties hereto may execute this Guaranty Supplement by signing any such counterpart.
 
Section 4.  Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial, Etc.  (a)  THIS GUARANTY SUPPLEMENT AND ANY CLAIMS, CONTROVERSY, DISPUTE OR CAUSE OF ACTION (WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR TORT OR OTHERWISE) BASED UPON, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS GUARANTY SUPPLEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT (EXCEPT, AS TO ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT, AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH THEREIN) AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND THEREBY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
 
(b)                                 The undersigned hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that it will not commence any action, litigation or proceeding of any kind or description, whether at law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Related Party of the foregoing in any way relating to this Guaranty Supplement or any other Loan Document or the transactions relating hereto or thereto, in any forum other than
 





 
the courts of the State of New York sitting in New York County, and of the United States District Court of the Southern District of New York, and any appellate court from any thereof, and each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the jurisdiction of such courts and agrees that all claims in respect of any such action, litigation or proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York State court or, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in such federal court.  The undersigned agrees that a final judgment in any such action, litigation or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.  Nothing in this Guaranty Supplement or in any other Loan Document shall affect any right that the Administrative Agent, any Lender may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to this Guaranty Supplement or any other Loan Document against the undersigned or its properties in the courts of any jurisdiction.
 
(c)                                  The undersigned irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Guaranty Supplement or any other Loan Document in any court referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section.  The undersigned hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.
 
(d)                                 THE UNDERSIGNED HEREBY WAIVES TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING INVOLVING, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ANY MATTER (WHETHER SOUNDING IN TORT, CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE) IN ANY WAY ARISING OUT OF, RELATED TO, OR CONNECTED WITH ANY LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE RELATIONSHIP ESTABLISHED THEREUNDER.
