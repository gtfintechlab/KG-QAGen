Once an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit has been issued, the Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) the applicable L/C Issuer to permit the extension of such Letter of Credit at any time to an expiry date not later than the Letter of Credit Expiration Date; provided, however, that the L/C applicable Issuer shall not permit any such extension if (A) such L/C Issuer has determined that it would not be permitted, or would have no obligation, at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its revised form (as extended) under the terms hereof (by reason of the provisions of clause (ii) or (iii) of Section 2.03(a) or otherwise), or (B) it has received notice (which may be by telephone or in writing) on or before the day that is seven Business Days before the Non-Extension Notice Date (1) from the Administrative Agent that the Required Lenders have elected not to permit such extension or (2) from the Administrative Agent, any Lender or a Borrower that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in Section 4.02 is not then satisfied, and in each such case directing the applicable L/C Issuer not to permit such extension.(iv)Promptly after its delivery of any Letter of Credit or any amendment to a Letter of Credit to an advising bank with respect thereto or to the beneficiary thereof, the applicable L/C Issuer will also deliver to the applicable Borrower and the Administrative Agent a true and complete copy of such Letter of Credit or amendment.(c)Drawings and Reimbursements; Funding of Participations.(i)Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit of any notice of a drawing under such Letter of Credit, the L/C Issuer shall, within a period stipulated by terms and conditions of Letter of Credit following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under such Letter of Credit. After such examination, the applicable L/C Issuer shall notify the applicable Borrower and the Administrative Agent thereof.  In the case of a Letter of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency, the applicable Borrower shall reimburse the applicable L/C Issuer in such Alternative Currency, unless (A) such L/C Issuer (at its option) shall have specified in such notice that it will require reimbursement in Dollars, or (B) in the absence of any such requirement for reimbursement in Dollars, the applicable Borrower shall have notified such L/C Issuer promptly following receipt of the notice of drawing that the Company will reimburse such L/C Issuer in Dollars.  In the case of any such reimbursement in Dollars of a drawing under a Letter of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency, the applicable L/C Issuer shall notify the applicable Borrower of the Dollar Equivalent of the amount of the drawing promptly following the determination thereof.  Not later than (x) if notice of payment is received by the applicable Borrower by 12:00 noon on the date of any payment by an L/C Issuer under a Letter of Credit to be reimbursed in Dollars, 4:00 p.m. on such payment date, (y) if notice of payment is not received by the applicable Borrower by 12:00 noon on the date of any payment by an L/C Issuer under a Letter of Credit to be reimbursed in Dollars, 4:00 p.m. on the first Business Day occurring after such payment date, or (z) the Applicable Time on the date of any payment by an L/C Issuer under a Letter of Credit to be reimbursed in an Alternative Currency (each such date, an “Honor Date”), the applicable Borrower shall reimburse such L/C Issuer in an amount equal to the amount of such drawing and in the applicable currency.  In the event that (A) a drawing denominated in an Alternative Currency is to be reimbursed in Dollars pursuant to the second sentence in this Section 2.03(c)(i) and (B) the Dollar amount paid by the applicable Borrower, whether on or after the Honor Date, shall not be adequate on the date of that payment to purchase in accordance with normal banking procedures a sum denominated in the Alternative Currency equal to 41the drawing, the applicable Borrower agrees, as a separate and independent obligation, to indemnify the applicable L/C Issuer for the loss resulting from its inability on that date to purchase the Alternative Currency in the full amount of the drawing.  If the applicable Borrower fails to timely reimburse the applicable L/C Issuer on the Honor Date, such L/C Issuer shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the Honor Date, the amount of the unreimbursed drawing (expressed in Dollars in the amount of the Dollar Equivalent thereof in the case of a Letter of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency) (the “Unreimbursed Amount”), and the amount of such Lender’s Applicable Percentage thereof.  In such event, the applicable Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a Revolving Borrowing of Base Rate Loans to be disbursed on the Honor Date in an amount equal to the Unreimbursed Amount, without regard to the minimum and multiples specified in Section 2.02 for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans, but subject to the amount of the unutilized portion of the Aggregate Revolving Commitments and the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (other than the delivery of a Loan Notice).  Any notice given by an L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 2.03(c)(i) may be given by telephone if immediately confirmed in writing; provided that the lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice.(ii)Each Lender shall upon any notice pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(i) make funds available (and the Administrative Agent may apply Cash Collateral provided for this purpose) for the account of the applicable L/C Issuer, in Dollars, at the Administrative Agent’s Office for Dollar-denominated payments in an amount equal to its Applicable Percentage of the Unreimbursed Amount not later than 1:00 p.m. on the Business Day specified in such notice by the Administrative Agent, whereupon, subject to the provisions of Section 2.03(c)(iii), each Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Revolving Loan to the applicable Borrower in such amount.  The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the applicable L/C Issuer in Dollars.(iii)With respect to any Unreimbursed Amount that is not fully refinanced by a Revolving Borrowing of Base Rate Loans because the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 cannot be satisfied or for any other reason, the applicable Borrower shall be deemed to have incurred from the applicable L/C Issuer an L/C Borrowing in the amount of the Unreimbursed Amount that is not so refinanced, which L/C Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the Default Rate.  In such event, each Lender’s payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(ii) shall be deemed payment in respect of its participation in such L/C Borrowing and shall constitute an L/C Advance from such Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this Section 2.03.(iv)Until each Lender funds its Revolving Loan or L/C Advance pursuant to this Section 2.03(c) to reimburse the applicable L/C Issuer for any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of such Lender’s Applicable Percentage of such amount shall be solely for the account of the applicable L/C Issuer.(v)Each Lender’s obligation to make Revolving Loans or L/C Advances to reimburse the applicable L/C Issuer for amounts drawn under Letters of Credit, as contemplated by this Section 2.03(c), shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense 42or other right which such Lender may have against such L/C Issuer, the Company, any Borrower, any Subsidiary or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; provided, however, that each Lender’s obligation to make Revolving Loans pursuant to this Section 2.03(c) is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (other than delivery by the applicable Borrower of a Loan Notice).  No such making of an L/C Advance shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the applicable Borrower to reimburse an L/C Issuer for the amount of any payment made by such L/C Issuer under any Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided herein.(vi)If any Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable L/C Issuer any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.03(c) by the time specified in Section 2.03(c)(ii), then, without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, such L/C Issuer shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to such L/C Issuer at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by such L/C Issuer in connection with the foregoing.  If such Lender pays such amount (with interest and fees as aforesaid), the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender’s Revolving Loan included in the relevant Revolving Borrowing or L/C Advance in respect of the relevant L/C Borrowing, as the case may be.  A certificate of the applicable L/C Issuer submitted to any Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (vi) shall be conclusive absent manifest error.(d)Repayment of Participations.(i)At any time after an L/C Issuer has made a payment under any Letter of Credit and has received from any Lender such Lender’s L/C Advance in respect of such payment in accordance with Section 2.03(c), if the Administrative Agent receives for the account of the applicable L/C Issuer any payment in respect of the related Unreimbursed Amount or interest thereon (whether directly from the applicable Borrower or otherwise, including proceeds of Cash Collateral applied thereto by the Administrative Agent), the Administrative Agent will distribute to such Lender its Applicable Percentage thereof in Dollars and in the same funds as those received by the Administrative Agent.(ii)If any payment received by the Administrative Agent for the account of an L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(i) is required to be returned under any of the circumstances described in Section 10.05 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the applicable L/C Issuer in its discretion), each Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such L/C Issuer its Applicable Percentage thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned by such Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect.  The obligations of the Lenders under this clause shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.(e)Obligations Absolute.  The obligation of a Borrower to reimburse an L/C Issuer for each drawing under each Letter of Credit and to repay each L/C Borrowing shall be absolute, 43unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all circumstances, including the following:(i)any lack of validity or enforceability of such Letter of Credit, this Agreement, or any other Loan Document;(ii)the existence of any claim, counterclaim, setoff, defense or other right that the applicable Borrower or any Subsidiary may have at any time against any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), an L/C Issuer or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or by such Letter of Credit or any agreement or instrument relating thereto, or any unrelated transaction;(iii)any draft, demand, certificate or other document presented under such Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; or any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under such Letter of Credit;(iv)waiver by the applicable L/C Issuer of any requirement that exists for such L/C Issuer’s protection and not the protection of the applicable Borrower or any waiver by the applicable L/C Issuer which does not in fact materially prejudice the applicable Borrower;(v)honor of a demand for payment presented electronically even if such Letter of Credit requires that demand be in the form of a draft;(vi)any payment made by an L/C Issuer in respect of an otherwise complying item presented after the date specified as the expiration date of, or the date by which documents must be received under, such Letter of Credit if presentation after such date is authorized by the UCC, the ISP or the UCP, as applicable;(vii)any payment by an L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or certificate that does not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; or any payment made by an L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit to any Person purporting to be a trustee in bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidator, receiver or other representative of or successor to any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit, including any arising in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law;(viii)any adverse change in the relevant exchange rates or in the availability of the relevant Alternative Currency to the applicable Borrower or any Subsidiary or in the relevant currency markets generally; or(ix)any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, including any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the applicable Borrower or any Subsidiary.The applicable Borrower shall promptly examine a copy of each Letter of Credit and each amendment thereto that is delivered to it and, in the event of any claim of noncompliance with the applicable Borrower’s instructions or other irregularity, the applicable Borrower will immediately 44notify the applicable L/C Issuer.  The applicable Borrower shall be conclusively deemed to have waived any such claim against the applicable L/C Issuer and its correspondents unless such notice is given as aforesaid.(f)Role of L/C Issuer.  Each Lender and each Borrower agree that, in paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit, an L/C Issuer shall not have any responsibility to obtain any document (other than any sight draft, certificates and documents expressly required by the Letter of Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such document or the authority of the Person executing or delivering any such document.  None of the L/C Issuers, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of the L/C Issuers shall be liable to any Lender for (i) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the approval of the Lenders or the Required Lenders, as applicable; (ii) any action taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (iii) the due execution, effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any document or instrument related to any Letter of Credit or Issuer Document.  Each Borrower hereby assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit for the account of such Borrower; provided, however, that this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude the applicable Borrower’s pursuing such rights and remedies as it may have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other agreement.  None of the L/C Issuers, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of the L/C Issuers shall be liable or responsible for any of the matters described in clauses (i) through (viii) of Section 2.03(e); provided, however, that anything in such clauses to the contrary notwithstanding, a Borrower may have a claim against an L/C Issuer, and an L/C Issuer may be liable to a Borrower, to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to consequential or exemplary, damages suffered by the applicable Borrower which the applicable Borrower proves were caused by such L/C Issuer’s willful misconduct or gross negligence or such L/C Issuer’s willful failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the beneficiary of a sight draft and certificate(s) strictly complying with the terms and conditions of a Letter of Credit.  In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the L/C Issuers may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and the L/C Issuers shall not be responsible for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason.  The L/C Issuers may send a Letter of Credit or conduct any communication to or from the beneficiary via the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (“SWIFT”) message or overnight courier, or any other commercially reasonable means of communicating with a beneficiary.(g)Applicability of ISP and UCP; Limitation of Liability. Unless otherwise expressly agreed by the applicable L/C Issuer and the Company or the applicable Borrower when a Letter of Credit is issued, the rules of the ISP shall apply to each Letter of Credit.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, an L/C Issuer shall not be responsible to the applicable Borrower for, and no L/C Issuer’s rights and remedies against the applicable Borrower shall be impaired by, any action or inaction of an L/C Issuer required or permitted under any law, order, or practice that is required or permitted to be applied to any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, including the Law or any order of a jurisdiction where an L/C Issuer or the beneficiary is located, the practice stated in the ISP or UCP, as applicable, or in the decisions, opinions, practice statements, or official commentary of the ICC Banking Commission, the Bankers Association for Finance and Trade - International Financial Services 45Association (BAFT-IFSA), or the Institute of International Banking Law & Practice, whether or not any Letter of Credit chooses such law or practice.(h)Letter of Credit Fees.  The Company or the applicable Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender in accordance, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 2.18, with its Applicable Percentage, in Dollars, a Letter of Credit fee (the “Letter of Credit Fee”) for each  Letter of Credit equal to the Applicable Rate times the Dollar Equivalent of the daily amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit.  For purposes of computing the daily amount available to be drawn under any Letter of Credit, the amount of such Letter of Credit shall be determined in accordance with Section 1.09.  Letter of Credit Fees shall be (i) due and payable on the first Business Day after the end of each March, June, September and December, commencing with the first such date to occur after the issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the Letter of Credit Expiration Date and thereafter on demand and (ii) computed on a quarterly basis in arrears.  If there is any change in the Applicable Rate during any quarter, the daily amount available to be drawn under each Letter of Credit shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Rate separately for each period during such quarter that such Applicable Rate was in effect.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, upon the request of the Required Lenders, while any Event of Default exists, all Letter of Credit Fees shall accrue at the Default Rate.(i)Fronting Fee and Documentary and Processing Charges Payable to L/C Issuer.  The applicable Borrower shall pay directly to each L/C Issuer for its own account, in Dollars, a fronting fee with respect to each Letter of Credit issued by it, at the rate per annum equal to 0.125%, computed on the Dollar Equivalent of the daily amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit on a quarterly basis in arrears.  Such fronting fee shall be due and payable on the tenth Business Day after the end of each March, June, September and December in respect of the most recently-ended quarterly period (or portion thereof, in the case of the first payment), commencing with the first such date to occur after the issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the Letter of Credit Expiration Date and thereafter on demand.  For purposes of computing the daily amount available to be drawn under any Letter of Credit, the amount of such Letter of Credit shall be determined in accordance with Section 1.09.  In addition, the Company or the applicable Borrower shall pay directly to each L/C Issuer for its own account, in Dollars, the customary issuance, presentation, amendment and other processing fees, and other standard costs and charges, of such L/C Issuer relating to letters of credit as from time to time in effect.  Such customary fees and standard costs and charges are due and payable on demand and are nonrefundable.(j)Conflict with Issuer Documents.  In the event of any conflict between the terms hereof and the terms of any Issuer Document, the terms hereof shall control.(k)Letter of Credit Reports.  For so long as any Letter of Credit issued by an L/C Issuer is outstanding, such L/C Issuer shall deliver to the Administrative Agent on the last Business Day of each calendar month, and on each date that an L/C Credit Extension occurs, a report in the form of Exhibit J, appropriately completed with the information for every outstanding Letter of Credit issued by such L/C Issuer.(l)Additional L/C Issuers, Multiple L/C Issuers.  The Company may, at any time and from time to time, designate one or more additional Revolving Lenders (subject to the consent of each such Revolving Lender in its sole discretion) to act as an L/C Issuer under the terms of this Agreement.  Any Revolving Lender designated as an L/C Issuer pursuant to this subclause (l) shall have all the rights and obligations of an L/C Issuer under the Loan Documents with respect to Letters 46of Credit issued or to be issued by it, and all references in the Loan Documents to the term “L/C Issuer” shall, with respect to such Letters of Credit, be deemed to refer to such Revolving Lender in its capacity as an L/C Issuer, as the context shall require.  Any such new L/C Issuer shall agree with the Company in writing as to such L/C Issuer’s Letter of Credit Commitment (which shall not, for the avoidance of doubt, increase the aggregate Letter of Credit Sublimit), and the Company shall promptly provide such information to the Administrative Agent prior to such Person becoming an L/C Issuer.  If at any time there is more than one L/C Issuer hereunder, the Company or the applicable Borrower may, in its discretion subject to the limitations set forth herein, select which L/C Issuer is to issue any particular Letter of Credit.2.04 Swing Line Loans.(a)The Swing Line.  Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, each Swing Line Lender, in reliance upon the agreements of the other Lenders set forth in this Section 2.04, hereby agrees to cause its Designated Euro Lending Affiliate to make loans in Euros (each such loan, a “Swing Line Loan”) to any Borrower that is a Foreign Subsidiary from time to time on any Business Day during the Availability Period in an aggregate amount not to exceed at any time outstanding the amount of the Swing Line Sublimit; provided, however, that (x) after giving effect to any Swing Line Loan, (i) the Outstanding Amount of all Swing Line Loans made by such Swing Line Lender shall not exceed such Swing Line Lender’s Swing Line Commitment, (ii) the Total Revolving Outstandings shall not exceed the Aggregate Revolving Commitments, (iii) the Revolving Credit Exposure of any Lender shall not exceed such Lender’s Commitment, and (iv) no Lender shall have a Maximum Fronting Availability that is less than zero without its written consent, (y) the Company shall not use the proceeds of any Swing Line Loan to refinance any outstanding Swing Line Loan, and (z) no Swing Line Lender shall be under any obligation to make any Swing Line Loan if it shall determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that it has, or by such Credit Extension may have, Fronting Exposure.  Within the foregoing limits, and subject to the other terms and conditions hereof, the Company may borrow under this Section 2.04, prepay under Section 2.05, and reborrow under this Section 2.04.  Each Swing Line Loan shall bear interest at the Overnight Rate, plus the Applicable Rate margin otherwise applicable to Revolving Borrowings that are Eurocurrency Rate Loans.  Immediately upon the making of a Swing Line Loan, each Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the applicable Swing Line Lender a risk participation in such Swing Line Loan in an amount equal to the product of such Lender’s Applicable Percentage times the amount of such Swing Line Loan.(b)Borrowing Procedures.  Each Swing Line Borrowing shall be made upon the Company’s irrevocable notice to the applicable Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent and the applicable European office of the Administrative Agent, which shall be given by a Swing Line Loan Notice. Each such Swing Line Loan Notice must be received by the applicable Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent not later than 1:00 p.m. (Applicable Time) on the requested borrowing date and shall specify (i) the amount to be borrowed, which shall be a minimum of the equivalent of $250,000, and (ii) the requested borrowing date, which shall be a Business Day.  Promptly after receipt by any Swing Line Lender of any Swing Line Loan Notice, such Swing Line Lender will confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the Administrative Agent has also received such Swing Line Loan Notice and, if not, such Swing Line Lender will notify the Administrative Agent of the contents thereof.  Unless the applicable Swing Line Lender has received notice (by telephone or in writing) from the Administrative Agent (including at the request of any Lender) prior to 2:00 p.m. (Applicable Time) on the date of the 47proposed Swing Line Borrowing (A) directing such Swing Line Lender not to make such Swing Line Loan as a result of the limitations set forth in the first proviso to the first sentence of Section 2.04(a), or (B) that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in Article IV is not then satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the applicable Swing Line Lender will, not later than 3:00 p.m. (Applicable Time) on the borrowing date specified in such Swing Line Loan Notice, make the amount of its Swing Line Loan available to the Company.(c)Refinancing of Swing Line Loans.(i)The applicable Swing Line Lender at any time in its sole discretion may request, on behalf of the Company (which hereby irrevocably authorizes each Swing Line Lender to so request on its behalf), that each Lender make a Revolving Loan (in the currency of the applicable Swing Line Loans) in an amount equal to such Lender’s Applicable Percentage of the amount of its Swing Line Loans then outstanding.  Such request shall be made in writing (which written request shall be deemed to be a Loan Notice for purposes hereof) and in accordance with the requirements of Section 2.02, without regard to the minimum and multiples specified therein for the principal amount of Loans of applicable type, but subject to the unutilized portion of the Aggregate Revolving Commitments and the conditions set forth in Section 4.02.  The applicable Swing Line Lender shall furnish the Company with a copy of the applicable Loan Notice promptly after delivering such notice to the Administrative Agent.  Each Lender shall make an amount equal to its Applicable Percentage of the amount specified in such Loan Notice available to the Administrative Agent in Same Day Funds (and the Administrative Agent may apply Cash Collateral available with respect to the applicable Swing Line Loan) for the account of such Swing Line Lender at the Administrative Agent’s Office for Euro-denominated payments not later than 1:00 p.m. on the day specified in such Loan Notice, whereupon, in each case, subject to Section 2.04(c)(ii), each Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Revolving Loan to the Company in such amount.  The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the applicable Swing Line Lender.(ii)If for any reason any Swing Line Loan cannot be refinanced by such a Revolving Borrowing in accordance with Section 2.04(c)(i), the request for Revolving Loans submitted by the applicable Swing Line Lender as set forth herein shall be deemed to be a request by such Swing Line Lender that each of the Lenders fund its risk participation in the relevant Swing Line Loan and each Lender’s payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Swing Line Lender pursuant to Section 2.04(c)(i) shall be deemed payment in respect of such participation.(iii)If any Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of any Swing Line Lender any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.04(c) by the time specified in Section 2.04(c)(i), such Swing Line Lender shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the Swing Line Lender at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by such Swing Line Lender in connection with the foregoing.  If such Lender pays such amount (with interest and fees as aforesaid), the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender’s Revolving Loan included in the relevant Revolving Borrowing or 48funded participation in the relevant Swing Line Loan, as the case may be.  A certificate of the applicable Swing Line Lender submitted to any Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (iii) shall be conclusive absent manifest error.(iv)Each Lender’s obligation to make Revolving Loans or to purchase and fund risk participations in Swing Line Loans pursuant to this Section 2.04(c) shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against the applicable Swing Line Lender, the Company or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; provided, however, that each Lender’s obligation to make Revolving Loans pursuant to this Section 2.04(c) is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 4.02.  No such funding of risk participations shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Company to repay Swing Line Loans, together with interest as provided herein.(d)Repayment of Participations.(i)At any time after any Lender has purchased and funded a risk participation in a Swing Line Loan, if the applicable Swing Line Lender receives any payment on account of such Swing Line Loan, such Swing Line Lender will distribute to such Lender its Applicable Percentage thereof in the same funds as those received by the Swing Line Lender.(ii)If any payment received by any Swing Line Lender in respect of principal or interest on any Swing Line Loan is required to be returned by such Swing Line Lender under any of the circumstances described in Section 10.05 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Swing Line Lender in its discretion), each Lender shall pay to such Swing Line Lender its Applicable Percentage thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned, at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate.  The Administrative Agent will make such demand upon the request of the applicable Swing Line Lender.  The obligations of the Lenders under this clause shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.(e)Interest for Account of Swing Line Lender.  Each Swing Line Lender shall be responsible for invoicing the Company for interest on the Swing Line Loans made by such Swing Line Lender.  Until each Lender funds its Revolving Loan or risk participation pursuant to this Section 2.04 to refinance such Lender’s Applicable Percentage of any Swing Line Loan, interest in respect of such Applicable Percentage shall be solely for the account of the applicable Swing Line Lender.(f)Payments Directly to Swing Line Lender.  The Company shall make all payments of principal and interest in respect of the Swing Line Loans directly to the applicable Swing Line Lender.(g)Swing Line Reports.  Each Swing Line Lender shall deliver to the Administrative Agent, on each Business Day that a Swing Line Loan made by it is outstanding, and on each date that a Swing Line Loan is made by it, a writing setting forth the outstanding principal amount, currency, borrowing date and Borrower of each such Swing Line Loan.49(h)Multiple Swing Line Lenders.  If at any time there is more than one Swing Line Lender hereunder, the Company may, in its discretion subject to the limitations set forth herein, select which Swing Line Lender is to provide any particular Swing Line Loan.2.05    Prepayments.  (a) Each Borrower may, upon notice from the Company to the Administrative Agent, at any time or from time to time voluntarily prepay Revolving Loans in whole or in part without premium or penalty; provided that (i) such notice must be a Notice of Loan Prepayment and be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. (A) three Business Days prior to any date of prepayment of Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Dollars, (B) four Business Days (or five, in the case of prepayment of Loans denominated in Special Notice Currencies) prior to any date of prepayment of Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Alternative Currencies, and (C) on the date of prepayment of Base Rate Loans (or, in each case, such shorter period as the Administrative Agent may agree in its sole discretion); (ii) any prepayment of Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Dollars shall be in a principal amount of $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof; (iii) any prepayment of Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Alternative Currencies shall be in a minimum principal amount of $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof; and (iv) any prepayment of Base Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of $500,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof or, in each case, if less, the entire principal amount thereof then outstanding.  Each such notice shall specify the date and amount of such prepayment and the Type(s) of Loans to be prepaid and, if Eurocurrency Rate Loans are to be prepaid, the Interest Period(s) of such Loans.  The Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Lender of its receipt of each such notice, and of the amount of such Lender’s Applicable Percentage of such prepayment.  If such notice is given by the Company, the applicable Borrower shall make such prepayment and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein; provided that if such notice is given in connection with a full or partial refinancing of the Facilities, such notice may condition the prepayment upon the effectiveness of such refinancing Indebtedness, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Company (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date of such prepayment) if such condition is not satisfied; provided that the applicable Borrower shall pay any amounts required pursuant to Section 3.05.  Any prepayment of a Eurocurrency Rate Loan shall be accompanied by all accrued interest on the amount prepaid, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.05.  Each such prepayment shall be applied to the Loans of the Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentage.(b)    The Company may, upon notice to the applicable Swing Line Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at any time or from time to time, voluntarily prepay Swing Line Loans in whole or in part without premium or penalty; provided that (i) such notice must be received by such Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent not later than 12:00 noon, London time, one Business Day prior to the proposed repayment, and (ii) any such prepayment shall be in a minimum principal amount of $100,000.  Each such notice shall specify the date and amount of such prepayment.  If such notice is given by the Company, the Company shall make such prepayment and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein.(c)    If the Administrative Agent notifies the Company at any time that the Total Revolving Outstandings at such time exceed an amount equal to 100% of the Aggregate Revolving Commitments then in effect, then, within two Business Days after receipt of such notice, the Borrowers shall prepay Loans and/or the Company shall Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations in an aggregate amount at least equal to such excess; provided, however, that, subject to the provisions 50of Section 2.17(a), the Company shall not be required to Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations pursuant to this Section 2.05(c) unless after the prepayment in full of the Loans the Total Revolving Outstandings exceed the Aggregate Revolving Commitments then in effect.  The Administrative Agent may, at any time and from time to time after the initial deposit of such Cash Collateral, request that additional Cash Collateral be provided in order to protect against the results of exchange rate fluctuations.(d)    If the Administrative Agent notifies the Company at any time that the Outstanding Amount of L/C Obligations owed to any L/C Issuer at such time exceed an amount equal to 100% of such L/C Issuer’s Letter of Credit Commitments then in effect, then, within two Business Days after receipt of such notice, the Borrowers shall prepay L/C Obligations and/or the Company shall Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations of such L/C Issuer in an aggregate amount at least equal to such excess.  The L/C Issuer may, at any time and from time to time after the initial deposit of such Cash Collateral, request that additional Cash Collateral be provided in order to protect against the results of exchange rate fluctuations.(e)    If the Administrative Agent notifies the Company at any time that the Outstanding Amount of Swing Line Loans owed to any Swing Line Lender at such time exceed an amount equal to 100% of such Swing Line Lender’s Swing Line Commitments then in effect, then, within two Business Days after receipt of such notice, the Borrowers shall prepay Swing Line Loans of such Swing Line Lender in an aggregate amount at least equal to such excess.  The Swing Line Lender may, at any time and from time to time after the initial deposit of such Cash Collateral, request that additional Cash Collateral be provided in order to protect against the results of exchange rate fluctuations.2.06     Termination or Reduction of Commitments.  The Company may, upon notice to the Administrative Agent, terminate the Aggregate Revolving Commitments, or from time to time permanently reduce the Aggregate Revolving Commitments; provided that (i) any such notice shall be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. three Business Days prior to the date of termination or reduction (or such shorter period as the Administrative Agent may agree in its sole discretion), (ii) any such partial reduction shall be in an aggregate amount of $10,000,000 or any whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, (iii) the Company shall not terminate or reduce the Aggregate Revolving Commitments if, after giving effect thereto and to any concurrent prepayments hereunder, the Total Revolving Outstandings would exceed the Aggregate Revolving Commitments, and (iv) if, after giving effect to any reduction of the Aggregate Revolving Commitments, the Letter of Credit Sublimit or the Swing Line Sublimit exceeds the amount of the Aggregate Revolving Commitments, such sublimit shall be automatically reduced by the amount of such excess.  The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Lenders of any such notice of termination or reduction of the Aggregate Revolving Commitments.  If such notice from the Company described above in this paragraph is given in connection with a full or partial refinancing of the Revolving Commitments, such notice may condition the reduction or termination upon the effectiveness of such refinancing, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Company (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date of the effectiveness of such termination) if such condition is not satisfied.  The amount of any such Aggregate Revolving Commitment reduction shall not be applied to the Letter of Credit Sublimit unless otherwise specified by the Company. Any reduction of the Aggregate Revolving Commitments shall be applied to the Commitment of each Lender according to its Applicable Percentage, to the Letter of Credit Commitments in accordance with the Applicable L/C Percentages and to the Swing Line Commitments in accordance with the Applicable Swing Line Percentages.  All fees accrued until 51the effective date of any termination of the Aggregate Revolving Commitments shall be paid on the effective date of such termination.2.07    Repayment of Loans.  (a) [Reserved].(b)    Each Borrower shall repay to the Revolving Lenders on the Maturity Date the aggregate principal amount of Revolving Loans made to such Borrower outstanding on such date.(c)    Each Borrower shall repay each Swing Line Loan on the earlier to occur of (i) the date ten Business Days after such Loan is made and (ii) the Maturity Date.2.08    Interest.  (a) Subject to the provisions of subsection (b) below, (i) each Eurocurrency Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof for each Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to the Eurocurrency Rate for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Rate; (ii) each Base Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate; (iii) [reserved]; and (iv) each Swing Line Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum equal the Overnight Rate, plus the Applicable Rate margin otherwise applicable to Revolving Borrowings that are Eurocurrency Rate Loans.(b)    (i) If any amount of principal of any Loan is not paid when due (without regard to any applicable grace periods), whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, such amount shall thereafter bear interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws.(ii)    If any amount (other than principal of any Loan) payable by any Borrower under any Loan Document is not paid when due (without regard to any applicable grace periods), whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, then upon the request of the Required Lenders, such amount shall thereafter bear interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws.(iii)    Upon the request of the Required Lenders, while any Event of Default exists (other than as set forth in clauses (b)(i) and (b)(ii) above), the Borrowers shall pay interest on the principal amount of all outstanding Loans and any overdue other Obligations hereunder at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws.(iv)    Accrued and unpaid interest on past due amounts (including interest on past due interest) shall be due and payable upon demand.(c)    Interest on each Loan shall be due and payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date applicable thereto and at such other times as may be specified herein.  Interest hereunder shall be due and payable in accordance with the terms hereof before and after judgment, and before and after the commencement of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law.(d)    For the purposes of the Interest Act (Canada), (i) whenever a rate of interest or fee rate hereunder is calculated on the basis of a year (the “deemed year”) that contains fewer days than the actual number of days in the calendar year of calculation, such rate of interest or fee rate shall 52be expressed as a yearly rate by multiplying such rate of interest or fee rate by the actual number of days in the calendar year of calculation and dividing it by the number of days in the deemed year, (ii) the principle of deemed reinvestment of interest shall not apply to any interest calculation hereunder and (iii) the rates of interest stipulated herein are intended to be nominal rates and not effective rates or yields.2.09    Fees.  In addition to certain fees described in subsections (h) and (i) of Section 2.03:(a)Commitment Fee.  The Company shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender in accordance with its Applicable Percentage, a commitment fee in Dollars equal to the Applicable Rate times the actual daily amount by which the Aggregate Revolving Commitments exceed the sum of (i) the Outstanding Amount of Revolving Loans and (ii) the Outstanding Amount of L/C Obligations, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 2.18.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Outstanding Amount of Swing Line Loans shall not be counted towards or considered usage of the Aggregate Revolving Commitments for purposes of determining the commitment fee. The commitment fee shall accrue at all times during the Availability Period, including at any time during which one or more of the conditions in Article IV is not met, and shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December, commencing with the first such date to occur after the Closing Date, and on the last day of the Availability Period.  The commitment fee shall be calculated quarterly in arrears, and if there is any change in the Applicable Rate during any quarter, the actual daily amount shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Rate separately for each period during such quarter that such Applicable Rate was in effect.(b)Other Fees.  The Company shall pay to the Arrangers and the Administrative Agent for their own respective accounts, in Dollars, fees in the amounts and at the times specified in the Fee Letters.  Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever.2.10    Computation of Interest and Fees.  All computations of interest for Base Rate Loans (including Base Rate Loans determined by reference to the Eurocurrency Rate) shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed.  All other computations of fees and interest shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed (which results in more fees or interest, as applicable, being paid than if computed on the basis of a 365-day year) , or, in the case of interest in respect of Loans denominated in Alternative Currencies as to which market practice differs from the foregoing, in accordance with such market practice.  Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion is paid, provided that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall, subject to Section 2.12(a), bear interest for one day.  Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. With respect to all Non-LIBOR Quoted Currencies, the calculation of the applicable interest rate shall be determined in accordance with market practice.2.11    Evidence of Debt.  (a) The Credit Extensions made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by the Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of business.  The accounts or records maintained by the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of the Credit 53Extensions made by the Lenders to the Borrowers and the interest and payments thereon.  Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrowers hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations.  In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error.  Upon the request of any Lender to a Borrower made through the Administrative Agent, such Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative Agent) a Note, which shall evidence such Lender’s Loans to such Borrower in addition to such accounts or records.  Each Lender may attach schedules to a Note and endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount, currency and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto.(b)    In addition to the accounts and records referred to in subsection (a) above, each Lender and the Administrative Agent shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice accounts or records evidencing the purchases and sales by such Lender of participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans.  In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by the Administrative Agent and the accounts and records of any Lender in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error.2.12    Payments Generally; Administrative Agent's Clawback.  (a) General.  All payments to be made by the Borrowers shall be made free and clear of and without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff.  Except as otherwise expressly provided herein and except with respect to principal of and interest on Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency, all payments by the Borrowers hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the applicable Administrative Agent’s Office in Dollars and in Same Day Funds not later than 2:00 p.m. on the date specified herein.  Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrowers hereunder with respect to principal and interest on Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the applicable Administrative Agent’s Office in such Alternative Currency and in Same Day Funds not later than the Applicable Time specified by the Administrative Agent on the dates specified herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent may require that any payments due under this Agreement be made in the United States.  If, for any reason, any Borrower is prohibited by any Law from making any required payment hereunder in an Alternative Currency, such Borrower shall make such payment in Dollars in the Dollar Equivalent of the Alternative Currency payment amount.  The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Applicable Percentage (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender’s Lending Office.  All payments received by the Administrative Agent (i) after 2:00 p.m., in the case of payments in Dollars, or (ii) after the Applicable Time specified by the Administrative Agent in the case of payments in an Alternative Currency, shall in each case be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue.  If any payment to be made by any Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be.(b)    (i) Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent.  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing of Eurocurrency Rate Loans (or, in the case of any Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, prior to 12:00 noon on the date of such Borrowing) that such Lender will not make available to the 54Administrative Agent such Lender’s share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with Section 2.02 (or, in the case of a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, that such Lender has made such share available in accordance with and at the time required by Section 2.02) and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower a corresponding amount.  In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the applicable Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to such Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the Overnight Rate, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing, and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by such Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans.  If such Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to such Borrower the amount of such interest paid by such Borrower for such period.  If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender’s Loan included in such Borrowing.  Any payment by such Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim such Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.(ii)    Payments by Borrowers; Presumptions by Administrative Agent.  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or an L/C Issuer hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the applicable L/C Issuer, as the case may be, the amount due.  In such event, if such Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the applicable L/C Issuer, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or such L/C Issuer, in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Overnight Rate.A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this subsection (b) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.(c)    Failure to Satisfy Conditions Precedent.  If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender to any Borrower as provided in the foregoing provisions of this Article II, and such funds are not made available to such Borrower by the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable Credit Extension set forth in Article IV are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest.(d)    Obligations of Lenders Several.  The (i) obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Loans, to fund participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans and to make payments pursuant to Section 10.04(c), (ii) obligations of the L/C Issuers to issue Letters of Credit and (iii) obligations of the Swing Line Lenders to make Swing Line Loans are, in each case, several and not joint.  The failure of any Lender to make any Loan, to fund any such participation or to make any 55payment under Section 10.04(c) on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan, to purchase its participation or to make its payment under Section 10.04(c).(e)    Funding Source.  Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner.2.13    Sharing of Payments by Lenders.  If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of the Loans made by it under the Revolving Facility, or the participations in L/C Obligations or in Swing Line Loans held by it resulting in such Lender’s receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of such Loans or participations and accrued interest thereon greater than its pro rata share thereof as provided herein, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans under the Revolving Facility and subparticipations in L/C Obligations and Swing Line Loans of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and other amounts owing them, provided that:(i)if any such participations or subparticipations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations or subparticipations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and(ii)the provisions of this Section shall not be construed to apply to (w) any payment to an L/C Issuer or a Swing Line Lender in respect of Letters of Credit issued by it or Swing Line Loans made by it, (x) any payment made by or on behalf of any Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender), (y) the application of Cash Collateral provided for in Section 2.17, or (z) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or subparticipations in L/C Obligations or Swing Line Loans to any assignee or participant, other than an assignment to Holdings or any Subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this Section shall apply).Each Loan Party consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Loan Party rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Loan Party in the amount of such participation.2.14    Designated Borrowers.  (a) Effective as of the date hereof CBV and Elwood shall each be a “Designated Borrower” hereunder and may receive Revolving Loans for its account on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.(b)    The Company may at any time, upon not less than 15 Business Days’ notice from the Company to the Administrative Agent (or such shorter period as may be agreed by the 56Administrative Agent in its sole discretion), designate any additional Subsidiary of the Company (an “Applicant Borrower”) as a Designated Borrower to receive Loans hereunder by delivering to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly deliver counterparts thereof to each Lender) a duly executed notice and agreement in substantially the form of Exhibit H (a “Designated Borrower Request and Assumption Agreement”).  The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that prior to any Applicant Borrower becoming entitled to utilize the credit facilities provided for herein the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall have received such supporting resolutions, incumbency certificates, opinions of counsel and other documents or information, in form, content and scope reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent (including know-your-customer information), as may be reasonably required by the Administrative Agent or the Lenders, and Notes signed by such new Borrowers to the extent any Lenders so require.  If the Administrative Agent and each Lender agree that an Applicant Borrower shall be entitled to receive Loans hereunder, then promptly following receipt of all such requested resolutions, incumbency certificates, opinions of counsel and other documents or information, the Administrative Agent shall send a notice in substantially the form of Exhibit I (a “Designated Borrower Notice”) to the Company and the Lenders specifying the effective date upon which the Applicant Borrower shall constitute a Designated Borrower for purposes hereof, whereupon each of the Lenders agrees to permit such Designated Borrower to receive Loans hereunder, on the terms and conditions set forth herein, and each of the parties agrees that such Designated Borrower otherwise shall be a Borrower for all purposes of this Agreement; provided that no Loan Notice or Letter of Credit Application may be submitted by or on behalf of such Designated Borrower until the date five Business Days after such effective date.(c)    The Obligations of all Designated Borrowers shall be several in nature.(d)    Each Subsidiary of the Company that is or becomes a “Designated Borrower” pursuant to this Section 2.14 hereby irrevocably appoints the Company as its agent for all purposes relevant to this Agreement and each of the other Loan Documents, including (i) the giving and receipt of notices, (ii) the execution and delivery of all documents, instruments and certificates contemplated herein and all modifications hereto, (iii) the receipt of the proceeds of any Loans made by the Lenders to any such Designated Borrower hereunder and (iv) the receipt of service of process.  Any acknowledgment, consent, direction, certification or other action which might otherwise be valid or effective only if given or taken by all Borrowers, or by each Borrower acting singly, shall be valid and effective if given or taken only by the Company, whether or not any such other Borrower joins therein.  Any notice, demand, consent, service of process, acknowledgement, direction, certification or other communication delivered to the Company in accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been delivered to each Designated Borrower.(e)    The Company may from time to time, upon not less than 15 Business Days’ notice from the Company to the Administrative Agent (or such shorter period as may be agreed by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion), terminate a Designated Borrower’s status as such, provided that there are no outstanding Loans payable by such Designated Borrower, or other amounts payable by such Designated Borrower on account of any Loans made to it, as of the effective date of such termination. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Lenders of any such termination of a Designated Borrower’s status.2.15    Extension of Maturity Date of Revolving Facility. (a)    Requests for Extension.  The Company may, by notice to the Administrative Agent  (who shall promptly notify the Revolving Lenders) not earlier than 60 days and not later than 30 57days prior to any anniversary of the date hereof (each, an “Anniversary Date”), request that each Revolving Lender extend such Lender’s Maturity Date with respect to the Revolving Facility for an additional one year from the Maturity Date; provided that the Maturity Date may not be extended pursuant to this Section 2.15 on more than two occasions.(b)    Revolving Lender Elections to Extend.  Each Revolving Lender, acting in its sole and individual discretion, shall, by notice to the Administrative Agent given not earlier than 30 days prior to the relevant Anniversary Date and not later than the date (the “Notice Date”) that is 20 days prior to the relevant Anniversary Date, advise the Administrative Agent whether or not such Revolving Lender agrees to such extension (and each Revolving Lender that determines not to so extend its Maturity Date with respect to the Revolving Facility (a “Non-Extending Lender”) shall notify the Administrative Agent of such fact promptly after such determination (but in any event no later than the Notice Date) and any Revolving Lender that does not so advise the Administrative Agent on or before the Notice Date shall be deemed to be a Non-Extending Lender.  The election of any Revolving Lender to agree to such extension shall not obligate any other Revolving Lender to so agree.(c)    Notification by Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent shall notify the Company of each Revolving Lender’s determination under this Section no later than the date 15 days prior to the relevant Anniversary Date (or, if such date is not a Business Day, on the next preceding Business Day).(d)    Additional Commitment Lenders.  The Company shall have the right to replace each Non-Extending Lender with, and add as “Revolving Lenders” under this Agreement in place thereof, one or more Eligible Assignees (each, an “Additional Revolving Lender”) as provided in Section 10.13; provided that each of such Additional Revolving Lenders shall enter into an Assignment and Assumption pursuant to which such Additional Revolving Lender shall undertake a Revolving Commitment (and, if any such Additional Revolving Lender is already a Revolving Lender, its Revolving Commitment shall be in addition to such Revolving Lender’s Revolving Commitment hereunder on such date).(e)    Minimum Extension Requirement.  If (and only if) the total of the Revolving Commitments of the Revolving Lenders that have agreed so to extend their Maturity Date with respect to the Revolving Facility (each, an “Extending Lender”) and the additional Revolving Commitments of the Additional Revolving Lenders shall be more than 50% of the aggregate amount of the Revolving Commitments in effect immediately prior to the relevant Anniversary Date, then, effective as of the relevant Anniversary Date, the Maturity Date of each Extending Lender and of each Additional Revolving Lender shall be extended to the date falling one year after the then-existing Maturity Date (except that, if such date is not a Business Day, such Maturity Date as so extended shall be the next preceding Business Day) and each Additional Revolving Lender shall thereupon become a “Revolving Lender” for all purposes of this Agreement.(f)    Conditions to Effectiveness of Extensions.  As a condition precedent to such extension, the Company shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a certificate of each Loan Party dated as of the relevant Anniversary Date signed by a Responsible Officer of such Loan Party (i) certifying and attaching the resolutions adopted by such Loan Party approving or consenting to such extension and (ii) in the case of the Company, certifying that, before and after giving effect to such extension, (A) the representations and warranties contained in Article V and the other Loan Documents are true and correct in all material respects (provided that representations qualified by 58“materiality” or “Material Adverse Effect” shall be true and correct in all respects) on and as of the relevant Anniversary Date, except representations and warranties that specifically refer to an earlier date, in which case they are true and correct in all material respects (provided that representations qualified by “materiality” or “Material Adverse Effect” shall be true and correct in all respects) as of such earlier date, and except that for purposes of this Section 2.15, the representations and warranties contained in subsections (a) and (b) of Section 5.05 shall be deemed to refer to the most recent statements furnished pursuant to subsections (a) and (b), respectively, of Section 6.01, and (B) no Default exists.  In addition, on the Maturity Date of each Non-Extending Lender, the Borrowers shall prepay any  Revolving Loans outstanding on such date (and pay any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.05) to the extent necessary to keep outstanding  Revolving Loans ratable with any revised Applicable Percentages of the respective Revolving Lenders effective as of such date.(g)    Conflicting Provisions.  This Section shall supersede any provisions in Section 2.13 or 10.01 to the contrary.2.16    Increase in Commitments.(a)    Request for Increase.  Provided there exists no Default, upon notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly notify the Lenders), the Company may, from time to time on up to three occasions, request (x) an increase in the Aggregate Revolving Commitments (an “Incremental Revolving Commitment”), (y) the establishment of term loan commitments hereunder under a new term loan credit facility (the “Incremental Term Loan Facility”; and, the term loan commitments under the Incremental Term Loan Facility, the “Incremental Term Loan Commitment”) or (z) after the initial establishment of Incremental Term Loan Facility hereunder, an increase to the Incremental Term Loan Commitments (each such increase under this clause (z), a “Term Loan Commitment Increase” and, together with any Incremental Revolving Commitments and the initial establishment of Incremental Term Loan Commitments under the Incremental Term Loan Facility, each a “Credit Increase”), by an amount not exceeding $500,000,000 in the aggregate for all such Credit Increases; provided that (i) any such request for a Credit Increase shall be in a minimum amount of $50,000,000, (ii) the final stated maturity date of such Incremental Term Loan Facility shall not be earlier than the Maturity Date and (iii) the terms and provisions of the Incremental Term Loan Facility shall be the same as the Revolving Facility, provided that the amortization schedule, pricing terms and maturity dates may be different than those terms with respect to the Revolving Facility.  At the time of sending such notice, the Company (in consultation with the Administrative Agent) shall specify the time period within which each Revolving Lender is requested to respond (which shall in no event be less than ten Business Days from the date of delivery of such notice to the Revolving Lenders).(b)    Lender Elections to Increase.  Each Lender shall notify the Administrative Agent within such time period whether or not it agrees, in its sole and absolute discretion to provide all or a portion of the Credit Increase and, if so, whether by an amount equal to, greater than, or less than its Applicable Percentage of such Credit Increase.  Any Revolving Lender not responding within such time period shall be deemed to have declined to provide such Credit Increase.(c)    Notification by Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent shall notify the Company and each Revolving Lender of the Revolving Lenders’ responses to each request made hereunder.  To achieve the full amount of a requested increase and subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent, and, in the case of Incremental Revolving Commitments, each L/C Issuer and each Swing Line Lender, the Company may also invite additional Eligible Assignees to become 59Lenders pursuant to a joinder agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and its counsel.(d)    Effective Date and Allocations.  If any Credit Increase is provided to the Company in accordance with this Section, the Administrative Agent and the Company shall determine the effective date (the “Increase Effective Date”) and the final allocation of such Credit Increase.  The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Company and the Revolving Lenders of the final allocation of such Credit Increase and the Increase Effective Date..(e)    Conditions to Effectiveness of Increase.  As a condition precedent to such Credit Increase, the Company shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a certificate of each Loan Party dated as of the Increase Effective Date signed by a Responsible Officer of such Loan Party (x) certifying and attaching the resolutions adopted by such Loan Party approving or consenting to such Credit Increase, and (y) in the case of the Company, certifying that, before and after giving effect to such Credit Increase, (A) the representations and warranties contained in Article V and the other Loan Documents are true and correct in all material respects (provided that representations  qualified by “materiality” or “Material Adverse Effect” shall be true and correct in all respects) on and as of the Increase Effective Date, except representations and warranties that specifically refer to an earlier date, in which case they are true and correct in all material respects (provided that representations qualified by “materiality” or “Material Adverse Effect” shall be true and correct in all respects) as of such earlier date, and except that for purposes of this Section 2.16, the representations and warranties contained in subsections (a) and (b) of Section 5.05 shall be deemed to refer to the most recent statements furnished pursuant to subsections (a) and (b), respectively, of Section 6.01, and (B) no Default exists.  The Borrowers shall prepay any Revolving Loans outstanding on the Increase Effective Date (and pay any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.05) to the extent necessary to keep the outstanding Revolving Loans ratable with any revised Applicable Percentages arising from any nonratable increase in the Revolving Commitments under this Section.(f)    Conflicting Provisions.  This Section shall supersede any provisions in Section 2.13 or 10.01 to the contrary.(g)    Credit Increase Amendment.  Any Credit Increase shall be evidenced by an amendment (a “Credit Increase Amendment”) to this Agreement, giving effect to the modifications permitted by this Section 2.16 (and subject to the limitations set forth in Section 2.16(e)), executed by the Loan Parties, the Administrative Agent and each Lender providing a portion of the Credit Increase; which such amendment, when so executed, shall amend this Agreement as provided therein.  Each Credit Increase Amendment may also provide for such amendments to the Loan Documents, and such other new Loan Documents, as the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers reasonably deem necessary or appropriate to effect the modifications and credit extensions permitted by this Section 2.16.  Neither any Credit Increase Amendment, nor any such amendments to the other Loan Documents or such other new Loan Documents, shall be required to be executed or approved by any Lender, other than the Lenders providing such Credit Increase and the Administrative Agent, in order to be effective.  The effectiveness of any Credit Increase Amendment shall be subject to the satisfaction on the date thereof of each of the conditions set forth in Section 2.16(e) and as such other conditions as requested by the Lenders under the Credit Increase established in connection therewith.2.17    Cash Collateral.60(a)    Certain Credit Support Events.  If (i) an L/C Issuer has honored any full or partial drawing request under any Letter of Credit and such drawing has resulted in an L/C Borrowing, (ii) as of the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, any L/C Obligation for any reason remains outstanding, (iii) the Company shall be required to provide Cash Collateral pursuant to Section 8.02(c), or (iv) there shall exist a Defaulting Lender, the Company shall immediately (in the case of clause (iii) above) or within one Business Day (in all other cases) following any request by the Administrative Agent or an L/C Issuer, provide Cash Collateral in an amount not less than the applicable Minimum Collateral Amount (determined in the case of Cash Collateral provided pursuant to clause (iv) above, after giving effect to Section 2.18(a)(iv) and any Cash Collateral provided by the Defaulting Lender).  Additionally, if the Administrative Agent notifies the Company at any time that the Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations at such time exceeds 100% of the Letter of Credit Sublimit then in effect, then, within two Business Days after receipt of such notice, the Company shall provide Cash Collateral for the Outstanding Amount of the L/C Obligations in an amount not less than the amount by which the Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations exceeds the Letter of Credit Sublimit.(b)    Grant of Security Interest.  The Company, and to the extent provided by any Defaulting Lender, such Defaulting Lender, hereby grants to (and subjects to the control of) the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the applicable L/C Issuers and the Lenders, and agrees to maintain, a first priority security interest in all such cash, deposit accounts and all balances therein, and all other property so provided as collateral pursuant hereto, and in all proceeds of the foregoing, all as security for the obligations to which such Cash Collateral may be applied pursuant to Section 2.17(c).  If at any time the Administrative Agent determines that Cash Collateral is subject to any right or claim of any Person other than the Administrative Agent or the L/C Issuers as herein provided,  or that the total amount of such Cash Collateral is less than the Minimum Collateral Amount, the Company will, promptly upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay or provide to the Administrative Agent additional Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to eliminate such deficiency. All Cash Collateral (other than credit support not constituting funds subject to deposit) shall be maintained in blocked, non-interest bearing deposit accounts at Bank of America.  The Company shall pay on demand therefor from time to time all customary account opening, activity and other administrative fees and charges in connection with the maintenance and disbursement of Cash Collateral.(c)    Application.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Cash Collateral provided under any of this Section 2.17 or Sections 2.03, 2.05, 2.17 or 8.02 in respect of Letters of Credit shall be held and applied to the satisfaction of the specific L/C Obligations, obligations to fund participations therein (including, as to Cash Collateral provided by a Defaulting Lender, any interest accrued on such obligation) and other obligations for which the Cash Collateral was so provided, prior to any other application of such property as may otherwise be provided for herein.(d)    Release.  Cash Collateral (or the appropriate portion thereof) provided to reduce Fronting Exposure or to secure other obligations shall be released promptly following (i) the elimination of the applicable Fronting Exposure or other obligations giving rise thereto (including by the termination of Defaulting Lender status of the applicable Lender (or, as appropriate, its assignee following compliance with Section 10.06(b)(vi))) or (ii) the determination by the Administrative Agent and the applicable L/C Issuer(s) that there exists excess Cash Collateral; provided, however, the Person providing Cash Collateral and the applicable L/C Issuer may agree that Cash Collateral shall not be released but instead held to support future anticipated Fronting Exposure or other obligations.612.18    Defaulting Lenders.(a)    Adjustments.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as that Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable Law:(i)    Waivers and Amendments.  Such Defaulting Lender’s right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in the definition of “Required Lenders” and Section 10.01.(ii)    Defaulting Lender Waterfall.  Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Article VIII or otherwise) or received by the Administrative Agent from a Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 10.08 shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder; second, to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the L/C Issuers or Swing Line Lenders hereunder; third, to Cash Collateralize the L/C Issuers’ Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender in accordance with Section 2.17; fourth, as the Company may request (so long as no Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent; fifth, if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Company, to be held in a deposit account and released pro rata in order to (x) satisfy such Defaulting Lender’s potential future funding obligations with respect to Loans under this Agreement and (y) Cash Collateralize the L/C Issuers’ future Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender with respect to future Letters of Credit issued under this Agreement, in accordance with Section 2.17; sixth, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders, the L/C Issuers or Swing Line Lenders as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender, the L/C Issuers or the Swing Line Lenders against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; seventh, so long as no Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Company as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Company against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and eighth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans or L/C Borrowings in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share, and (y) such Loans were made or the related Letters of Credit were issued at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of, and L/C Obligations owed to, all Non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of, or L/C Obligations owed to, such Defaulting Lender until such time as all Loans and funded and unfunded participations in L/C Obligations and Swing Line Loans are held by the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the Commitments hereunder without giving effect to Section 2.18(a)(iv).  Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section 2.18(a)(ii) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.62(iii)    Certain Fees.A.    No Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive any fee payable under Section 2.09(a) for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and the Company shall not be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender).B.    Each Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive Letter of Credit Fees for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender only to the extent allocable to its Applicable Percentage of the stated amount of Letters of Credit for which it has provided Cash Collateral pursuant to Section 2.17.C.    With respect to any fee payable under Section 2.09(a) or any Letter of Credit Fee not required to be paid to any Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (A) or (B) above, the Company shall (x) pay to each Non-Defaulting Lender that portion of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender with respect to such Defaulting Lender’s participation in L/C Obligations or Swing Line Loans that has been reallocated to such Non-Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (iv) below, (y) pay to the L/C Issuers and Swing Line Lenders, as applicable, the amount of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender to the extent allocable to such L/C Issuers’ or Swing Line Lenders’ Fronting Exposure to such Defaulting Lender, and (z) not be required to pay the remaining amount of any such fee.(iv)    Reallocation of Applicable Percentages to Reduce Fronting Exposure.  All or any part of such Defaulting Lender’s participation in L/C Obligations and Swing Line Loans shall be reallocated among the Non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages (calculated without regard to such Defaulting Lender’s Commitment) but only to the extent that such reallocation does not cause the aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure of any Non-Defaulting Lender to exceed such Non-Defaulting Lender’s Commitment.  Subject to Section 10.13, no reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a Non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such Non-Defaulting Lender’s increased exposure following such reallocation.(v)    Cash Collateral, Repayment of Swing Line Loans.  If the reallocation described in clause (a)(iv) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Company shall, without prejudice to any right or remedy available to it hereunder or under applicable Law, (x) first, prepay Swing Line Loans in an amount equal to the Swing Line Lenders’ Fronting Exposure and (y) second, Cash Collateralize the L/C Issuers’ Fronting Exposure in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.17.(b)    Defaulting Lender Cure.  If the Company, the Administrative Agent, each Swing Line Lender and each L/C Issuer agree in writing that a Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any Cash Collateral), that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Revolving Loans and funded and unfunded participations 63in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans to be held on a pro rata basis by the Lenders in accordance with their Applicable Percentages (without giving effect to Section 2.18(a)(iv)), whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Company while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender’s having been a Defaulting Lender.ARTICLE III.TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY3.01    Taxes.(a)    Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party hereunder shall be made free and clear of and without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable law; provided that if an applicable withholding agent shall be required to deduct or withhold any Tax from such payments, then (i) if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax or Other Tax, the sum payable shall be increased by an applicable Loan Party as necessary so that after making all required deduction or withholding (including deduction or withholding applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) each Recipient, as applicable, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made, (ii) such withholding agent shall make such deduction or withholding and (iii) such withholding agent shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.(b)    In addition, the Loan Parties shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.(c)    Each Loan Party shall indemnify each Recipient, within 10 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by such Recipient, as applicable, on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of such Loan Party hereunder (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) and any reasonable expense arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to such Loan Party by a Lender or an L/C Issuer, or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf, on behalf of another agent or on behalf of a Lender or an L/C Issuer, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.(d)    Each Lender and each L/C Issuer shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender or L/C Issuer (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Loan Parties to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s or L/C Issuer’s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 10.06(d) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender or L/C Issuer, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed 64or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender or L/C Issuer by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  Each Lender or L/C Issuer hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender or L/C Issuer under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender or L/C Issuer from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this subparagraph (d).(e)    As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by a Loan Party to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section 3.01, such Loan Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.(f)    (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which a Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to such Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), to the extent such Lender is legally entitled to do so, at the time or times prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by such Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by such Borrower or Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without such withholding tax or at a reduced rate.  In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by a Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by such Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable such Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, no Lender shall have any obligation under this paragraph (f) with respect to any withholding Tax imposed by any jurisdiction other than the United States if in the reasonable judgment of such Lender such compliance would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would otherwise materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.(ii)    Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that the applicable Borrower is a U.S. Borrower,(A)    any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed copies of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax;(B)    any Lender that is not a U.S. Person shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:65(1)    in the case of a Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, as applicable, establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “interest” article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, as applicable, establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “business profits” or “other income” article of such tax treaty;(2)    executed copies of IRS Form W-8ECI;(3)    in the case of a Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit L-1 to the effect that such Lender is not a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a “10 percent shareholder” of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a “controlled foreign corporation” described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a “U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate”) and (y) executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, as applicable; or(4)    to the extent a Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed copies of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate, substantially in the form of Exhibit L-2 or Exhibit L-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit L-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner;(C)    any Lender that is not a U.S. Person shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the applicable Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of such Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed copies of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit such Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made(iii)    If a payment made to a Lender (including any L/C Issuer) under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the applicable Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or 66times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the applicable Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the applicable Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the applicable Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine whether such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount, if any, to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (iii), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date hereof.(iv)    Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the applicable Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.(g)    If a Recipient determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by a Loan Party or with respect to which such Loan Party has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 3.01, it shall pay over such refund to such Loan Party (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such Loan Party under this Section 3.01 with respect to the Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of such Recipient (including any Taxes imposed with respect to such refund) and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); provided that such Loan Party, upon the request of such Recipient, agrees to repay as soon as reasonably practicable the amount paid over to such Loan Party (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to such Recipient in the event such Recipient is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (g), in no event will the Recipient be required to pay any amount to an Loan Party pursuant to this paragraph (g) the payment of which would place the Recipient in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the Recipient would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This Section shall not be construed to require any Recipient to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes which it deems confidential) to the Loan Parties or any other Person.3.02    Illegality.  If any Lender reasonably determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund or charge interest with respect to any Credit Extension based upon the Eurocurrency Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars or any Alternative Currency in the applicable interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Company through the Administrative Agent, (i) any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Credit Extensions in the affected currency or currencies or, in the case of Eurocurrency Rate Loans in Dollars, to convert Base Rate Loans to Eurocurrency Rate Loans, shall be suspended, and (ii) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or maintaining Base Rate Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the Eurocurrency Rate component of the Base Rate, the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurocurrency Rate component 67of the Base Rate, in each case until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Company that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist.  Upon receipt of such notice, (x) the Borrowers shall, upon written demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable and such Loans are denominated in Dollars, convert all Eurocurrency Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurocurrency Rate component of the Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Rate Loans and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Rate, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the Eurocurrency Rate component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal  for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Rate.  Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrowers shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.3.03    Inability to Determine Rates.  (a)If in connection with any request for a Eurocurrency Rate Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof,  (i) (A) the Administrative Agent determines that deposits (whether in Dollars or an Alternative Currency) are not being offered to banks in the applicable offshore interbank market for such currency for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Eurocurrency Rate Loan, or (B) (x) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurocurrency Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurocurrency Rate Loan (whether denominated in Dollars or an Alternative Currency) or in connection with an existing or proposed Base Rate Loan and (y) the circumstances described in Section 3.03(c)(i) do not apply (in each case with respect to this clause (i), “Impacted Loans”), or (ii) the Administrative Agent or Required Lenders determine that for any reason the Eurocurrency Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurocurrency Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Eurocurrency Rate Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Company and each Lender.  Thereafter, (x) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurocurrency Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies shall be suspended, (to the extent of the affected Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Interest Periods), and (y) in the event of a determination described in the preceding sentence with respect to the Eurocurrency Rate component of the Base Rate, the utilization of the Eurocurrency Rate component in determining the Base Rate shall be suspended, in each case until the Administrative Agent (or, in the case of a determination by the Required Lenders described in clause (ii) of Section 3.03(a), until the Administrative Agent upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice.  Upon receipt of such notice, the Company may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies (to the extent of the affected Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Interest Periods) or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Revolving Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in Dollars in the amount specified therein (in the case of a request for a Revolving Borrowing).(b)Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Administrative Agent has made the determination described in clause (i) of Section 3.03(a), the Administrative Agent, in consultation with the Borrower, may establish an alternative interest rate for the Impacted Loans, in which case, such alternative rate of interest shall apply with respect to the Impacted Loans until (1) the 68Administrative Agent revokes the notice delivered with respect to the Impacted Loans under clause (i) of the first sentence of this section, (2) the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that such alternative interest rate does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding the Impacted Loans, or (3) any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to such alternative rate of interest or to determine or charge interest rates based upon such rate or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to do any of the foregoing and provides the Administrative Agent and the Borrower written notice thereof(c)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other Loan Documents, if the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error), or the Company or Required Lenders notify the Administrative Agent (with, in the case of the Required Lenders, a copy to Company) that the Company or Required Lenders (as applicable) have determined, that:(i)adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining LIBOR for any requested Interest Period, including, without limitation, because the LIBOR Screen Rate is not available or published on a current basis and such circumstances are unlikely to be temporary, (ii)the administrator of the LIBOR Screen Rate or a Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the Administrative Agent has made a public statement identifying a specific date after which LIBOR or the LIBOR Screen Rate shall no longer be made available, or used for determining the interest rate of loans (such specific date, the “Scheduled Unavailability Date”), or(iii)syndicated loans currently being executed, or that include language similar to that contained in this Section, are being executed or amended (as applicable) to incorporate or adopt a new benchmark interest rate to replace LIBOR,then, reasonably promptly after such determination by the Administrative Agent or receipt by the Administrative Agent of such notice, as applicable,  the Administrative Agent and the Company may amend this Agreement to replace LIBOR with an alternate benchmark rate (including any mathematical or other adjustments to the benchmark (if any) incorporated therein), giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similar U.S. dollar denominated syndicated credit facilities for such alternative benchmarks (any such proposed rate, a “LIBOR Successor Rate”), together with any proposed LIBOR Successor Rate Conforming Changes and any such amendment shall become effective at 5:00 p.m. (New York time) on the fifth Business Day after the Administrative Agent shall have posted such proposed amendment to all Lenders and the Borrower unless, prior to such time, Lenders comprising the Required Lenders have delivered to the Administrative Agent written notice that such Required Lenders do not accept such amendment.  If no LIBOR Successor Rate has been determined and the circumstances under clause (i) above exist or the Scheduled Unavailability Date has occurred (as applicable), the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Company and each Lender.  Thereafter, (x) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected Eurodollar Rate Loans or Interest Periods), and (y) the Eurocurrency Rate component shall no longer 69be utilized in determining the Base Rate.  Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans (to the extent of the affected Eurodollar Rate Loans or Interest Periods) or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans (subject to the foregoing clause (y)) in the amount specified therein.Notwithstanding anything else herein, any definition of LIBOR Successor Rate shall provide that in no event shall such LIBOR Successor Rate be less than zero for purposes of this Agreement.3.04    Increased Costs; Reserves on Eurocurrency Rate Loans.(a)    Increased Costs Generally.  If any Change in Law shall:(i)    impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement contemplated by Section 3.04(e), other than as set forth below) or any L/C Issuer;(ii)    subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than Indemnified Taxes and  Excluded Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; or(iii)    impose on any Lender or any L/C Issuer or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense (other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or Eurocurrency Rate Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Loan  (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan), or to increase the cost to such Lender or such L/C Issuer of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of Credit), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or such L/C Issuer hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender or such L/C Issuer, the Company will pay (or cause the applicable Designated Borrower to pay) to such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.(b)    Capital Requirements.  If any Lender or any L/C Issuer reasonably determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or such L/C Issuer or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender’s or such L/C Issuer’s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s or such L/C Issuer’s capital or on the capital of such Lender’s or such L/C Issuer’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit or Swing Line Loans held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such L/C Issuer, to a level below that which such Lender or such L/C Issuer or such Lender’s or such L/C Issuer’s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s or such L/C Issuer’s policies and the policies of such Lender’s or such L/C Issuer’s holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time 70to time the Company will pay (or cause the applicable Designated Borrower to pay) to such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such L/C Issuer or such Lender’s or such L/C Issuer’s holding company for any such reduction suffered.(c)    Certificates for Reimbursement.  A certificate of a Lender or an L/C Issuer setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or such L/C Issuer or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) of this Section and delivered to the Company shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  The Company shall pay (or cause the applicable Designated Borrower to pay) such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.(d)    Delay in Requests.  Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or any L/C Issuer to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.04 shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s or such L/C Issuer’s right to demand such compensation, provided that no Borrower shall be required to compensate a Lender or an L/C Issuer pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine months prior to the date that such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be, notifies the Company of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender’s or such L/C Issuer’s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).(e)    Additional Reserve Requirements.  The Company shall pay (or cause the applicable Designated Borrower to pay) to each Lender, (i) as long as such Lender shall be required to maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including Eurocurrency funds or deposits (currently known as “Eurocurrency liabilities”), additional interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Eurocurrency Rate Loan equal to the actual costs of such reserves allocated to such Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error), and (ii) as long as such Lender shall be required to comply with any reserve ratio requirement or analogous requirement of any other central banking or financial regulatory authority imposed in respect of the maintenance of the Commitments or the funding of the Eurocurrency Rate Loans, such additional costs (expressed as a percentage per annum and rounded upwards, if necessary, to the nearest five decimal places) equal to the actual costs allocated to such Commitment or Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error), which in each case shall be due and payable on each date on which interest is payable on such Loan, provided the Company shall have received at least 10 days’ prior notice (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of such additional interest or costs from such Lender.  If a Lender fails to give notice 10 days prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date, such additional interest or costs shall be due and payable 10 days from receipt of such notice.3.05    Compensation for Losses.  Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Company shall promptly compensate (or cause the applicable Designated Borrower to compensate) such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of:71(a)    any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise);(b)    any failure by any Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Company or the applicable Designated Borrower;(c)    any failure by any Borrower to make payment of any Loan or drawing under any Letter of Credit (or interest due thereon) denominated in an Alternative Currency on its scheduled due date or any payment thereof in a different currency; or(d)    any assignment of a Eurocurrency Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the Company pursuant to Section 10.13;including any loss of anticipated profits, any foreign exchange losses and any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan, from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained or from the performance of any foreign exchange contract.  The Company shall also pay (or cause the applicable Designated Borrower to pay) any customary administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing.For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Company (or the applicable Designated Borrower) to the Lenders under this Section 3.05, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Eurocurrency Rate Loan made by it at the Eurocurrency Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the offshore interbank market for such currency for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Eurocurrency Rate Loan was in fact so funded.3.06    Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.(a)    Designation of a Different Lending Office.  Each Lender may make any Credit Extension to a Borrower through any Lending Office, provided that the exercise of this option shall not affect the obligation of the applicable Borrower to repay the Credit Extension in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.04, or requires any Borrower to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender, any L/C Issuer, or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender or any L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 3.01, or if any Lender gives a notice pursuant to Section 3.02, then at the request of the Company such Lender or such L/C Issuer shall, as applicable, use reasonable efforts to designate a different Lending Office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender or such L/C Issuer, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.01 or 3.04, as the case may be, in the future, or eliminate the need for the notice pursuant to Section 3.02, as applicable, and (ii) in each case, would not subject such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be, to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be.  The Company hereby agrees to pay (or cause the applicable Designated Borrower to pay) all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender or any L/C Issuer in connection with any such designation or assignment.(b)    Replacement of Lenders.  IIf any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.04, or if any Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender 72or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.01 and, in each case, such Lender has declined or is unable to designate a different Lending Office in accordance with Section 3.06(a), the Company may replace such Lender in accordance with Section 10.13.3.07    Survival.

The provisions of this Article are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuers, and neither the Company nor any other Loan Party shall have rights as a third party beneficiary of any of such provisions.  It is understood and agreed that the use of the term “agent” herein or in any other Loan Documents (or any other similar term) with reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable Law. Instead such term is used as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting parties.9.02    Rights as a Lender.  The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent and the term “Lender” or “Lenders” shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity.  Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, own securities of, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrowers or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.9.03    Exculpatory Provisions.  The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, and its duties hereunder shall be administrative in nature.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent:(a)    shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing;(b)    shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents), provided that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law, including for the avoidance of doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any Debtor Relief Law or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any Debtor Relief Law; and(c)    shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating 94to any of the Borrowers or any of their respective Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Sections 10.01 and 8.02) or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment.  The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until notice describing such Default is given in writing to the Administrative Agent by the Company, a Lender or an L/C Issuer.The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.9.04    Reliance by Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person.  The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon.  In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, or the issuance, extension, renewal or increase of a Letter of Credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or an L/C Issuer, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender or such L/C Issuer unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender or such L/C Issuer prior to the making of such Loan or the issuance of such Letter of Credit.  The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Company), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.9.05    Delegation of Duties.  The Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub agents appointed by the Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties.  The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any sub-agents except to the extent that a 95court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and non appealable judgment that the Administrative Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such sub-agents.9.06    Resignation of Administrative Agent.  (a) The Administrative Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders, the L/C Issuers and the Company.  Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, with the written consent of the Company (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) if no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, to appoint a successor, which shall be a bank with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States.  If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the “Resignation Effective Date”), then the retiring Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) on behalf of the Lenders and the L/C Issuers, appoint, with the written consent of the Company (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) if no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above, provided that in no event shall any such successor Administrative Agent be a Defaulting Lender.  Whether or not a successor has been appointed, such resignation shall become effective in accordance with such notice on the Resignation Effective Date.(b)    If the Person serving as Administrative Agent is a Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (d) of the definition thereof, the Required Lenders may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, by notice in writing to the Company and such Person remove such Person as Administrative Agent and, with the written consent of the Company (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) if no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, appoint a successor.  If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the “Removal Effective Date”), then such removal shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice on the Removal Effective Date.(c)    With effect from the Resignation Effective Date or the Removal Effective Date (as applicable) (1) the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and (2) except for any indemnity payments or other amounts then owed to the retiring or removed Administrative Agent, all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender and each L/C Issuer directly, until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided for above.  Upon the acceptance of a successor’s appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or removed) Administrative Agent (other than as provided in Section 10.04(f) and other than any rights to indemnity payments or other amounts owed to the retiring or removed Administrative Agent as of the Resignation Effective Date or the Removal Effective Date, as applicable), and the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this Section) .  The fees payable by the Company to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Company and such successor.  After the retiring or removed Administrative Agent’s resignation or removal hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article and Section 10.04 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring or removed Administrative Agent, its sub agents and their respective 96Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them (i) while the retiring or removed Administrative Agent was acting as Administrative Agent and (ii) after such resignation or removal for as long as any of them continues to act in any capacity hereunder or under the other Loan Documents, including (a) acting as collateral agent or otherwise holding any collateral security on behalf of any of the Lenders and (b) in respect of any actions taken in connection with transferring the agency to any successor Administrative Agent.(d)    Any resignation by Bank of America as Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section shall also constitute its resignation as an L/C Issuer and Swing Line Lender.  If Bank of America resigns as an L/C Issuer, it shall retain all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of an L/C Issuer hereunder with respect to all Letters of Credit outstanding as of the effective date of its resignation as an L/C Issuer and all L/C Obligations with respect thereto, including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Loans or fund risk participations in Unreimbursed Amounts pursuant to Section 2.03(c).  If Bank of America resigns as Swing Line Lender, it shall retain all the rights of the Swing Line Lender provided for hereunder with respect to Swing Line Loans made by it and outstanding as of the effective date of such resignation, including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Loans or fund risk participations in outstanding Swing Line Loans pursuant to Section 2.04(c).  Upon the appointment by the Company of a successor L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender hereunder (which successor shall in all cases be a Lender other than a Defaulting Lender), (a) such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of such retiring L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender, as applicable, (b) such retiring L/C Issuer and Swing Line Lender shall be discharged from all of their respective duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents, and (c) the successor L/C Issuer shall issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession or make other arrangements satisfactory to Bank of America to effectively assume the obligations of Bank of America  with respect to such Letters of Credit.9.07    Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Lenders.  Each Lender and each L/C Issuer acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement.  Each Lender and each L/C Issuer also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.9.08    No Other Duties, Etc.  Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none of the Bookrunners, Arrangers, Syndication Agent or Documentation Agent listed on the cover page hereof shall have any powers, duties or responsibilities under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, except in its capacity, as applicable, as the Administrative Agent, a Lender or an L/C Issuer hereunder.9.09    Administrative Agent May File Proofs of Claim.  In case of the pendency of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or any other judicial proceeding relative to any Loan Party, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan or L/C Obligation shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on any Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise97(a)    to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans, L/C Obligations and all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders, the L/C Issuers and the Administrative Agent (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders, the L/C Issuers and the Administrative Agent and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders, the L/C Issuers and the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.03(h) and (i), 2.09 and 10.04) allowed in such judicial proceeding; and(b)    to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender and each L/C Issuer to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders and the L/C Issuers, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.09 and 10.04.Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender or any L/C Issuer any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Lender or any L/C Issuer to authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender or any L/C Issuer in any such proceeding.9.10    Guaranty Matters.  The Lenders, the Swing Line Lenders and the L/C Issuers irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent to release any Subsidiary Guarantor from its obligations under the Subsidiary Guaranty (a) if such Person ceases to be a Subsidiary as a result of a transaction permitted under the Loan Documents or (b) if such Subsidiary ceases to, or substantially contemporaneously with the release of its Subsidiary Guaranty hereunder will cease to, or at such time does not, Guarantee any Existing Notes or other Material Indebtedness of Holdings or the Company.

To the extent that any payment by or on behalf of any Borrower is made to the Administrative Agent, any L/C Issuer or any Lender, or the Administrative Agent, any L/C Issuer or any Lender exercises its right of setoff, and such payment or the proceeds of such setoff or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Administrative Agent, such L/C Issuer or such Lender in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or otherwise, then (a) to the extent of such recovery, the obligation or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived 105and continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such setoff had not occurred, and (b) each Lender and each L/C Issuer severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent upon demand its applicable share (without duplication) of any amount so recovered from or repaid by the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such payment is made at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect, in the applicable currency of such recovery or payment.

Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants to the extent provided in subsection (d) of this Section and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuers and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.(b)    Assignments by Lenders.  Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans (including for purposes of this subsection (b), participations in L/C Obligations and in Swing Line Loans) at the time owing to it); provided that so long as any Borrower is a Dutch Borrower, each such assignee constitutes a Professional Lender and any such assignment shall be subject to the following conditions:(i)    Minimum Amounts.(A)    in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender’s Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it under the Revolving Facility or in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender, no minimum amount need be assigned; and(B)    in any case not described in subsection (b)(i)(A) of this Section, the aggregate amount of the Commitment (which for this purpose includes Loans outstanding thereunder) or, if the applicable Commitment is not then in effect, the principal outstanding balance of the Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment, determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if “Trade Date” is specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade Date, shall not be less than $5,000,000, unless each of the Administrative Agent and, so long 106as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Company otherwise consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).(ii)    Proportionate Amounts.  Each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Loans or the Commitment assigned, except that this clause (ii) shall not apply to the Swing Line Lenders’ rights and obligations in respect of Swing Line Loans;(iii)    Required Consents.  No consent shall be required for any assignment except to the extent required by subsection (b)(i)(B) of this Section and, in addition:(A)    the consent of the Company (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required unless (1) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of such assignment or (2) such assignment is to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender; provided that the Company shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment unless it shall object thereto by written notice to the Administrative Agent within ten (10) Business Days after having received notice thereof;(B)    the consent of the Administrative Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required if such assignment is to a Person that is not a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender; and(C)    the consent of each L/C Issuer and the consent of each Swing Line Lender (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required for any assignment in respect of the Revolving Facility.(iv)    Assignment and Assumption.  The parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee in the amount of $3,500; provided, however, that the Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, elect to waive such processing and recordation fee in the case of any assignment.  The assignee, if it is not a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire.(v)    No Assignment to Certain Persons.  No such assignment shall be made (A) to the Company or any of the Company’s Affiliates or Subsidiaries, (B) to any Defaulting Lender or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Person who, upon becoming a Lender hereunder, would constitute any of the foregoing Persons described in this clause (B), or (C) to a natural Person (or to a holding company, investment vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated for the primary benefit of a natural Person).(vi)    Certain Additional Payments.  In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments to the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with the consent of the Company and the Administrative Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Loans previously requested but not 107funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent, any L/C Issuer or any Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon) and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro rata share of all Loans and participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans in accordance with its Applicable Percentage.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under applicable Law without compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs.Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection (c) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04, 3.05, and 10.04 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment; provided, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no assignment by a Defaulting Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender’s having been a Defaulting Lender.  Upon request, each Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and deliver a Note to the assignee Lender.  Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this subsection shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with subsection (d) of this Section.(c)    Register.  The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrowers, shall maintain at the Administrative Agent’s Office in the United States a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it (or the equivalent thereof in electronic form) and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts (and stated interest) of the Loans and L/C Obligations owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the “Register”).  The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement.  The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrowers and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.(d)    Participations.  Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, any Borrower, the Administrative Agent, any Swing Line Lender or any L/C Issuer, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural Person, or a holding company, investment vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated for the primary benefit of a natural Person, a Defaulting Lender or the Company or any of the Company’s Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a “Participant”) in all or a portion of such Lender’s rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans (including such Lender’s participations in L/C Obligations and/or Swing Line Loans) owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement shall remain 108unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuers shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement.  For the avoidance of doubt, each Lender shall be responsible for the indemnity under Section 10.04(c) without regard to the existence of any participation.Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in the first proviso to Section 10.01 that affects such Participant.  The Company agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04 and 3.05 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section (it being understood that the documentation required under Section 3.01(e) shall be delivered to the Lender who sells the participation) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section; provided that such Participant (A) agrees to be subject to the provisions of Sections 3.06 and 10.13 as if it were an assignee under subsection (b) of this Section and (B) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 3.01 or 3.04, with respect to any participation, than the Lender from whom it acquired the applicable participation would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation.  Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at the Company’s request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Company to effectuate the provisions of Section 3.06 with respect to any Participant.  To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.08 as though it were a Lender; provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.13 as though it were a Lender.  Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the applicable Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant’s interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the “Participant Register”); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant’s interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations.  The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.(e)    Certain Pledges.  Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.109(f)    [Reserved].(g)    Resignation as L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender after Assignment.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if at any time a Lender assigns all of its Revolving Commitment and Revolving Loans pursuant to subsection (b) above, such Lender may, (i) upon 30 days’ notice to the Company and the Lenders, resign as an L/C Issuer and/or (ii) upon 30 days’ notice to the Company, resign as a Swing Line Lender.  In the event of any such resignation as L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender, the Company shall be entitled to appoint from among the Lenders a successor L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender hereunder; provided, however, that no failure by the Company to appoint any such successor shall affect the resignation of such Lender as L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender, as the case may be.  If a Lender resigns as L/C Issuer, it shall retain all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the L/C Issuer hereunder with respect to all Letters of Credit outstanding as of the effective date of its resignation as L/C Issuer and all L/C Obligations with respect thereto (including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Revolving Loans or fund risk participations in Unreimbursed Amounts pursuant to Section 2.03(c)).  If a Lender resigns as Swing Line Lender, it shall retain all the rights of the Swing Line Lender provided for hereunder with respect to Swing Line Loans made by it and outstanding as of the effective date of such resignation, including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Revolving Loans or fund risk participations in outstanding Swing Line Loans pursuant to Section 2.04(c).  Upon the appointment of a successor L/C Issuer and/or Swing Line Lender, (a) such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender, as the case may be, and (b) the successor L/C Issuer shall issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession or make other arrangements satisfactory to such Lender to effectively assume the obligations of such Lender with respect to such Letters of Credit.10.07    Treatment of Certain Information; Confidentiality.  Each of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuers agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its Affiliates, its auditors and its Related Parties (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the extent required or requested by any regulatory authority purporting to have jurisdiction over such Person or its Related Parties (including any self-regulatory authority, such as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners), (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to any other party hereto, (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or under any other Loan Document or any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section, to (i) any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights and obligations under this Agreement or (ii) any actual or prospective party (or its Related Parties) to any swap, derivative or other transaction under which payments are to be made by reference to any of the Borrowers and their obligations, this Agreement or payments hereunder, (g) on a confidential basis to (i) any rating agency in connection with rating the Company or its Subsidiaries or the credit facilities provided hereunder or (ii) the CUSIP Service Bureau or any similar agency in connection with the issuance and monitoring of CUSIP numbers or other market identifiers with respect to the credit facilities provided hereunder, (h) with the consent of the Company or (i) to the extent such Information (x) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section or (y) becomes available to the Administrative Agent, any Lender, any L/C Issuer or any of their respective Affiliates on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than 110the Company.  In addition, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may disclose the existence of this Agreement and information about this Agreement to market data collectors, similar service providers to the lending industry and service providers to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in connection with the administration of this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, and the Commitments.For purposes of this Section, “Information” means all information received from the Company or any Subsidiary relating to the Company or any Subsidiary or any of their respective businesses, other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any L/C Issuer on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the Company or any Subsidiary, provided that, in the case of information received from the Company or any Subsidiary after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential.  Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information.Each of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuers acknowledges that (a) the Information may include material non-public information concerning the Company or a Subsidiary, as the case may be, (b) it has developed compliance procedures regarding the use of material non-public information and (c) it will handle such material non-public information in accordance with applicable Law, including United States Federal and state securities Laws.10.08    Right of Setoff.  If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender, each L/C Issuer and each of their respective Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, in whatever currency) at any time held and other obligations (in whatever currency) at any time owing by such Lender, such L/C Issuer or any such Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the Company or any other Loan Party against any and all of the obligations of the Company or such Loan Party now or hereafter existing under this Agreement or any other Loan Document to such Lender or such L/C Issuer or their respective Affiliates, irrespective of whether or not such Lender, L/C Issuer or Affiliate shall have made any demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and although such obligations of the Company or such Loan Party may be contingent or unmatured or are owed to a branch, office or Affiliate of such Lender or such L/C Issuer different from the branch, office or Affiliate holding such deposit or obligated on such indebtedness; provided, that in the event that any Defaulting Lender shall exercise any such right of setoff, (x) all amounts so set off shall be paid over immediately to the Administrative Agent for further application in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.18 and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuers and the Lenders, and (y) the Defaulting Lender shall provide promptly to the Administrative Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the Obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as to which it exercised such right of setoff.  The rights of each Lender, each L/C Issuer and their respective Affiliates under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that such Lender, such L/C Issuer or their respective Affiliates may have.  Each Lender and each L/C Issuer agrees to notify the Company and the Administrative Agent promptly after any such setoff and application, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application.11110.09    Interest Rate Limitation.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid under the Loan Documents shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious interest permitted by applicable Law (the “Maximum Rate”).  If the Administrative Agent or any Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the Company.  In determining whether the interest contracted for, charged, or received by the Administrative Agent or a Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the Obligations hereunder.10.10    Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness.  This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto in different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract.  This Agreement, the other Loan Documents, and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the Administrative Agent or the L/C Issuers, constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof.  Except as provided in Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof that, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto.  Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by facsimile or other electronic imaging means (e.g. “pdf” or “tif”) shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.10.11    Survival of Representations and Warranties.  All representations and warranties made hereunder and in any other Loan Document or other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and thereof.  Such representations and warranties have been or will be relied upon by the Administrative Agent and each Lender, regardless of any investigation made by the Administrative Agent or any Lender or on their behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default at the time of any Credit Extension, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as any Loan or any other Obligation hereunder shall remain unpaid or unsatisfied or any Letter of Credit shall remain outstanding.10.12    Severability.  If any provision of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, (a) the legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall not be affected or impaired thereby and (b) the parties shall endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions.  The invalidity of a provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.  Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this Section 10.12, if and to the extent that the enforceability of any provisions in this Agreement relating to Defaulting Lenders shall be limited by Debtor Relief Laws, as determined in good faith by the Administrative Agent, an L/C Issuer or a Swing Line Lender, as applicable, then such provisions shall be deemed to be in effect only to the extent not so limited.11210.13    Replacement of Lenders.  If the Company is entitled to replace a Lender pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.06, or if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender or a Non-Consenting Lender or if any other circumstance exists hereunder that gives the Company the right to replace a Lender as a party hereto, then the Company may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 10.06), all of its interests, rights (other than its existing rights to payments pursuant to Sections 3.01 and 3.04) and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an Eligible Assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment), provided that:(a)    the Company shall have paid (or caused a Designated Borrower to pay) to the Administrative Agent the assignment fee (if any) specified in Section 10.06(b);(b)    such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and L/C Advances, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under Section 3.05) from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Company or applicable Designated Borrower (in the case of all other amounts);(c)    in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 3.04 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 3.01, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter;(d)    such assignment does not conflict with applicable Laws; and(e)    in the case of an assignment resulting from a Lender becoming a Non-Consenting Lender, the applicable assignee shall have consented to the applicable amendment, waiver or consent.A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Company to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.10.14    Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Etc.

In connection with all aspects of each transaction contemplated hereby (including in connection with any amendment, waiver or other modification hereof or of any other Loan Document), the Company and each other Loan Party acknowledges and agrees, and acknowledges its Affiliates’ understanding, that: (i) (A) the arranging and other services regarding this Agreement provided by the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers and the Lenders are arm’s-length commercial transactions between the Company, each other Loan Party and their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers and the Lenders, on the other hand, (B) each of the Company and the other Loan Parties has consulted its own legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent it has deemed appropriate, and (C) the Company and each other Loan Party is capable of evaluating, and understands and accepts, the terms, risks and conditions of the transactions contemplated hereby and by the other Loan Documents; (ii) (A) the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers and each Lender is and has been acting solely as a principal and, except as expressly agreed in writing by the relevant parties, has not been, is not, and will not be acting as an advisor, agent or fiduciary for the Company, any other Loan Party or any of their respective Affiliates, or any other Person and (B) neither the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers nor any Lender has any obligation to the Company, any other Loan Party or any of their respective Affiliates with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby except those obligations expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents; and (iii) the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers and the Lenders and their respective Affiliates may be engaged in a broad range of transactions that involve interests that differ from those of the Company, the other Loan Parties and their respective Affiliates, and neither the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers, nor any Lender has any obligation to disclose any of such interests to the Company, any other Loan Party or any of their respective Affiliates.  To the fullest extent permitted by law, each of the Company and each other Loan Party hereby waives and releases any claims that it may have against the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers or any Lender with respect to any breach or alleged breach of agency or fiduciary duty in connection with any aspect of any transaction contemplated hereby.10.17    Electronic Execution of Assignments and Certain Other Documents.  The words “execute,” “execution,” “signed,” “signature,” and words of like import in or related to any document to be signed in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including without limitation Assignment and Assumptions, amendments or other modifications, Loan Notices, Swing Line Loan Notices, waivers and consents) shall be deemed to include electronic signatures, the electronic matching of assignment terms and contract formations on electronic platforms approved by the Administrative Agent, or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature or the 115use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent and as provided for in any applicable law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act, or any other similar state laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act; provided that notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary the Administrative Agent is under no obligation to agree to accept electronic signatures in any form or in any format unless expressly agreed to by the Administrative Agent pursuant to procedures approved by it.10.18    USA Patriot Act.

The obligation of each Borrower in respect of any such sum due from it to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder or under the other Loan Documents shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency (the “Judgment Currency”) other than that in which such sum is denominated in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement (the “Agreement Currency”), be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, of any sum adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency, the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase the Agreement Currency with the Judgment Currency.

If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is greater than the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent or any Lender in such currency, the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, agrees to return the amount of any excess to such Borrower (or to any other Person who may be entitled thereto under applicable law).10.20    ENTIRE AGREEMENT.

Solely to the extent any Lender or any L/C Issuer that is an EEA Financial Institution is a party to this 116Agreement and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Loan Document or in any other agreement, arrangement or understanding among any such parties, each party hereto acknowledges that any liability of any Lender or any L/C Issuer that is an EEA Financial Institution arising under any Loan Document, to the extent such liability is unsecured, may be subject to the Write-Down and Conversion Powers of an EEA Resolution Authority and agrees and consents to, and acknowledges and agrees to be bound by:(a)    the application of any Write-Down and Conversion Powers by an EEA Resolution Authority to any such liabilities arising hereunder which may be payable to it by any Lender or any L/C Issuer that is an EEA Financial Institution; and(b)    the effects of any Bail-In Action on any such liability, including, if applicable:(i)    a reduction in full or in part or cancellation of any such liability;(ii)    a conversion of all, or a portion of, such liability into shares or other instruments of ownership in such EEA Financial Institution, its parent entity, or a bridge institution that may be issued to it or otherwise conferred on it, and that such shares or other instruments of ownership will be accepted by it in lieu of any rights with respect to any such liability under this Agreement or any other Loan Document; or(iii)    the variation of the terms of such liability in connection with the exercise of the write-down and conversion powers of any EEA Resolution Authority.

The Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to the Administrative Agent, each Lender, each Swing Line Lender, each L/C Issuer and each other Person from time to time holding or owed payment with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations (collectively, the “Guarantee Beneficiaries”) the full and prompt payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by required prepayment, upon acceleration, demand or otherwise, and at all times thereafter, of the Guaranteed Obligations and the punctual performance of all of the terms contained in the Loan Documents.  This Guaranty is a guaranty of payment and performance and is not merely a guaranty of collection. As used herein, the term “Guaranteed Obligations” means any and all existing and future Obligations which may be payable by the Borrowers to the Guarantee Beneficiaries under the Credit Agreement and any other Loan Document (and, in each case, including all renewals, extensions, amendments, refinancings and other modifications thereof and all costs, attorneys’ fees and expenses incurred by any Guarantee Beneficiary in connection with the collection or enforcement thereof (in each case, to the extent required to be paid under the Credit Agreement)).

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing unconditional guarantee, for the avoidance of doubt, this Guaranty shall in no manner be released, discharged or otherwise affected or limited by (a) any waiver, modification or amendment of, or supplement to, any documentation governing the Guarantee Obligations, including the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents, (b) any change in the corporate existence, structure or ownership of (x) any Borrower or any guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations or (y) any Guarantee Beneficiary, (c) the existence of any claim, set-off or other rights which the Guarantor may have at any time against any Borrower, any Guarantee Beneficiary or any other entity, whether in connection with the Loan Documents or with unrelated transactions; provided, that this clause (c) shall not prevent the assertion of such claim by separate suit or in a compulsory counterclaim, (d) any invalidity or unenforceability relating to or against any Borrower for any reason relating to the Loan Documents or any other provision of applicable law or regulation purporting to prohibit the payment by any Borrower or any other guarantor of any Guaranteed Obligations or (e) any other act or omission to act or delay of any kind by any Borrower, any Guarantee Beneficiary or any other person.  2.No Setoff or Deductions; Taxes; Payments.  The Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that the Administrative Agent and the other Guarantee Beneficiaries have rights to receive payments under and with respect to this Guaranty without setoff or counterclaim and, except as provided by applicable law (in which case adjustment, if any, shall be made as set forth in Section 3.01 of the Credit Agreement), without deduction for taxes, levies, duties, charges, compulsory loans, fees, imposts, restrictions or withholdings, in each case, as more fully set forth in the Credit Agreement. In furtherance thereof, Section 2.12 and Section 3.01 of the Credit Agreement is hereby incorporated into this Guaranty, mutatis mutandis.  Payments hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Guarantee Beneficiaries, payable according to the terms of the Credit Agreement.  The obligations hereunder shall not be affected by any acts of any legislative body or governmental authority affecting the Guarantor, any Borrower or any other guarantor, including but not limited to, any restrictions on the conversion of currency or repatriation or control of funds or any total or partial expropriation of the Guarantor’s or any Borrower’s or other guarantor’s property, or by economic, political, regulatory or other events in the countries where the Guarantor, any other guarantor or any Borrower is located.3.Rights of Guarantee Beneficiaries.  The Guarantor consents and agrees that each Guarantee Beneficiary may, at any time and from time to time, without notice or demand, and without affecting the enforceability or continuing effectiveness hereof: (a) amend, extend, renew, compromise, discharge, accelerate or otherwise change the time for payment or the terms of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof; (b) take, hold, exchange, enforce, waive, release, fail to perfect, sell, or otherwise dispose of any security for the payment of this Guaranty or any Guaranteed Obligations; (c) apply such security and direct the order or manner of sale thereof as any Guarantee Beneficiary in its sole discretion may determine; and (d) release or substitute one or more of any endorsers or other guarantors of or obligors in respect of any of the Guaranteed Obligations. The Guarantor hereby consents and agrees that (i)  additional Borrowers may become party to the Credit Agreement after the date hereof, and this Guaranty shall remain in full force in effect (including with respect to Guaranteed Obligations incurred by such additional Borrowers), notwithstanding such addition and (ii) other guarantors may guarantee the Guaranteed Obligations, or any subset thereof, from time to time, and this Guaranty shall remain in full force and effect, notwithstanding any addition or release of such guarantors in any manner whatsoever. Without limiting the generality of the provisions set forth in this paragraph, the Guarantor consents to the taking of, or failure to take, any action which might in any manner or to any extent vary the risks of the Guarantor under this Guaranty or which, but for this provision, might operate as a discharge of the Guarantor.4.Certain Waivers.  The Guarantor waives to the fullest extent permitted by law (a) any defense arising by reason of any disability or other defense of any Borrower or any other 2guarantor, or the cessation from any cause whatsoever (including any act or omission of any Guarantee Beneficiary) of the liability of any Borrower; (b) any defense based on any claim that the Guarantor’s obligations exceed or are more burdensome than those of any Borrower (or all Borrowers); (c) the benefit of any statute of limitations affecting the Guarantor’s liability hereunder; (d) any right to require the Administrative Agent to proceed against any Borrower, proceed against or exhaust any security for the Guaranteed Obligations, or pursue any other remedy in the Administrative Agent’s or any other Guarantee Beneficiary’s power whatsoever and any defense based upon the doctrines of marshalling of assets or of election of remedies; (e) any benefit of and any right to participate in any security now or hereafter held by any Guarantee Beneficiary; (f) any fact or circumstance related to the Guaranteed Obligations which might otherwise constitute a defense to the obligations of the Guarantor under this Guaranty; (g) any law or regulation of any jurisdiction or any other event affecting any term of a Guaranteed Obligation and (h) any and all other defenses or benefits that may be derived from or afforded by applicable law limiting the liability of or exonerating guarantors or sureties, other than the defense that the Guaranteed Obligations have been fully performed and paid in full in cash. The Guarantor expressly waives all presentments, demands for payment or performance, notices of nonpayment or nonperformance, protests, notices of protest, notices of dishonor and a

currence of new or additional Guaranteed Obligations. This Guaranty shall not be affected by the genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of the Guaranteed Obligations or any instrument or agreement evidencing any Guaranteed Obligations, or by the existence, validity, enforceability, perfection, non-perfection or extent of any collateral therefor, or by any fact or circumstance relating to the Guaranteed Obligations which might otherwise constitute a defense to the obligations of the Guarantor under this Guaranty, and the Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any defenses it may now have or hereafter acquire in any way relating to any or all of the foregoing.5.Obligations Independent.  The obligations of the Guarantor hereunder are those of primary obligor, and not merely as surety, and are independent of the Guaranteed Obligations and the obligations of any other guarantor, and a separate action may be brought against the Guarantor to enforce this Guaranty whether or not any Borrower, any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other person or entity is joined as a party. 6.Subrogation.  The Guarantor shall not exercise any right of subrogation, contribution, indemnity, reimbursement or similar rights with respect to any payments it makes under this Guaranty until all of the Guaranteed Obligations and any amounts payable under this Guaranty have been paid and performed in full and all commitments of the Lenders pursuant to the Loan Documents are terminated.  If any amounts are paid to the Guarantor in violation of the foregoing limitation, then such amounts shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Guarantee Beneficiaries and shall forthwith be paid to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Guarantee Beneficiaries to reduce the amount of the Guaranteed Obligations, whether matured or unmatured.7.Termination; Reinstatement.  This Guaranty is a continuing and irrevocable guaranty of all Guaranteed Obligations now or hereafter existing and shall remain in full force and effect until all Guaranteed Obligations and any other amounts payable under this Guaranty are paid in full in cash and any commitments of the Lenders pursuant to the Loan Documents are terminated.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Guaranty shall continue in full force and effect or be revived, as the case may be, if any payment by or on behalf of the Borrowers, the Guarantor or any other 3guarantor is made, or a Guarantee Beneficiary exercises a right of setoff, in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations and such payment or the proceeds of such setoff or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Laws or otherwise, all as if such payment had not been made or such setoff had not occurred and whether or not the Administrative Agent is in possession of or has released this Guaranty and regardless of any prior revocation, rescission, termination or reduction.  The obligations of the Guarantor under this paragraph shall survive termination of this Guaranty.8.Subordination.  The Guarantor hereby subordinates the payment of all obligations and indebtedness of each Borrower owing to the Guarantor as subrogee of a Guarantee Beneficiary in respect of any performance by the Guarantor under this Guaranty, or otherwise resulting from the Guarantor’s performance under this Guaranty, to the indefeasible payment in full in cash of all Guaranteed Obligations.  If the Administrative Agent so requests, any such obligation or indebtedness of any Borrower to the Guarantor shall be enforced and performance received by the Guarantor as trustee for the Administrative Agent (for the benefit of the Guarantee Beneficiaries) and the proceeds thereof shall be paid over to the Administrative Agent on account of the Guaranteed Obligations, but without reducing or affecting in any manner the liability of the Guarantor under this Guaranty.9.Stay of Acceleration.  In the event that acceleration of the time for payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is stayed, in connection with any case commenced by or against the Guarantor or any Borrower under any Debtor Relief Laws, or otherwise, all such amounts shall nonetheless be payable by the Guarantor immediately upon demand by a Guarantee Beneficiary.10.Expenses.  The Guarantor shall pay on demand all out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses) in any way relating to the enforcement, or protection of the Guarantee Beneficiaries’ rights, under this Guaranty or in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations, including any incurred during any “workout” or restructuring in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations and any incurred in the preservation, protection or enforcement of any rights of the Guaranteed Beneficiaries in any proceeding pursuant to or in connection with any Debtor Relief Laws, in each case in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement.  The obligations of the Guarantor under this paragraph shall survive the payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations and termination of this Guaranty.11.Miscellaneous.   No provision of this Guaranty may be waived, amended, supplemented or modified, except by a written instrument executed by the Administrative Agent and the Guarantor.  No failure by the Administrative Agent or any other Guarantee Beneficiary to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, remedy or power hereunder or otherwise shall operate as a waiver of any right, remedy or power hereunder; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy or power hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy.  The remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law or in equity.  The unenforceability or invalidity of any provision of this Guaranty shall not affect the enforceability or validity of any other provision herein.  This Guaranty embodies the entire agreement and understanding between the Guarantor and the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Guarantee Beneficiaries, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings relating to the subject matter hereof.  The Guarantor agrees to execute and deliver such documents and take such actions as may be requested by the Administrative Agent to effect the purposes of this Guaranty.  This Guaranty may be executed in counterparts, and each such counterpart shall form part of one and the same instrument.  This Guaranty may be executed and 4delivered by electronic means (including “PDF”), and such execution and delivery shall be deemed effective as a manually executed counterpart hereof.12.Condition of Borrowers.  The Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that it has the sole responsibility for, and has adequate means of, obtaining from the Borrowers and any other guarantor (including Borrowers and guarantors added after the date hereof) such information concerning the financial condition, business and operations of the Borrowers and any such other guarantor as the Guarantor requires, and that the Administrative Agent and other Guarantee Beneficiaries have no duty, and the Guarantor is not relying on the Administrative Agent or any Guarantee Beneficiary at any time, to disclose to the Guarantor any information relating to the business, operations or financial condition of the Borrowers or any other guarantor (the Guarantor waiving any duty on the part of the Administrative Agent and Guarantee Beneficiaries to disclose such information and any defense relating to the failure to provide the same).  13.Setoff.   The Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that the Administrative Agent and the other Guarantee Beneficiaries have rights of setoff with respect to the Guarantor, as more fully set forth in the Credit Agreement.  In furtherance thereof, Section 10.08 of the Credit Agreement is hereby incorporated into this Guaranty, mutatis mutandis.  14.GOVERNING LAW; Assignment; Jurisdiction; Notices.  THIS GUARANTY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.  This Guaranty shall (a) bind the Guarantor and its successors and assigns, provided that the Guarantor may not assign its rights or obligations under this Guaranty without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (and any attempted assignment without such consent shall be void), and (b) inure to the benefit of the Administrative Agent (for the benefit of the Guarantee Beneficiaries) and its successors and assigns and the Administrative Agent and each Guarantee Beneficiary may, without notice to the Guarantor and without affecting the Guarantor’s obligations hereunder, assign, sell or grant participations in the Guaranteed Obligations and this Guaranty, in whole or in part.  The Guarantor hereby irrevocably (i) submits to the jurisdiction of any state court sitting in the State of New York, County of New York and the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (and, in each case, appellate courts thereof) in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Guaranty, (ii) waives to the fullest extent permitted by law any defense asserting an inconvenient forum in connection therewith and (iii) agrees it will not bring action in any action, litigation or proceeding of any kind or description against the Administrative Agent or any Guarantee Beneficiary or any Affiliate thereof relating hereto or to any other Loan Document in any court, tribunal or similar, except those referenced in the foregoing clause (i). SERVICE OF PROCCESS BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT IN CONNECTION WITH ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING SHALL BE BINDING ON THE GUARANTOR IF DELIVERED IN ACCORDANCE WITH DELIVERY OF NOTICES AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 10.02 OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. The Guarantor agrees that the Administrative Agent and each Guarantee Beneficiary may disclose to any assignee of or participant in, or any prospective assignee of or participant in, any of its rights or obligations of all or part of the Guaranteed Obligations any and all information in its possession concerning the Guarantor, this Guaranty and any security for this Guaranty, except as may be expressly limited by the Credit Agreement.  All notices and other communications to the Guarantor under this Guaranty shall be in writing and delivered pursuant to Section 10.02 of the Credit Agreement.515.    WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL; FINAL AGREEMENT.

If the Administrative Agent so notifies the Guarantor in writing, at the Administrative Agent’s sole and absolute discretion, payments under this Guaranty shall be the Dollar Equivalent of the Guaranteed Obligations or any portion thereof, determined as of the date payment is made.  If any claim arising under or related to this Guaranty is reduced to judgment denominated in a currency (the “Judgment Currency”) other than the currencies in which the Guaranteed Obligations are denominated or the currencies payable hereunder (collectively the “Obligations Currency”), the judgment shall be for the equivalent in the Judgment Currency of the amount of the claim denominated in the Obligations Currency included in the judgment, determined as of the date of judgment.  The equivalent of any Obligations Currency amount in any Judgment Currency shall be calculated as set forth in Section 10.19 of the Credit Agreement. The Guarantor shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and the Guarantee Beneficiaries and hold the Administrative Agent and Guarantee Beneficiaries harmless from and against all loss or damage resulting from any change in exchange rates between the date any claim is reduced to judgment and the date of payment thereof by the Guarantor or any failure of the amount of any such judgment to be calculated as provided in this paragraph.17.Direct Obligations.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein and for the avoidance of doubt, this Guaranty is in addition to the Guarantor’s direct obligations with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations (including any direct obligations as a Borrower under the Loan Documents), and this Guaranty shall in no event operate to limit or reduce such direct obligations.[Remainder Intentionally Empty]6IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Guarantor has caused this Guaranty to be duly executed as of the date first above written.CELANESE US HOLDINGS LLC,as Guarantor   By:  Name:  Title:  Accepted and Agreed:BANK OF AMERICA, N.A.,as Administrative Agent   By:  Name:  Title:  [Company Guaranty]EXHIBIT G-1FORM OF PARENT GUARANTY[See Attached]G-1-1PARENT GUARANTYThis PARENT GUARANTY (this “Guaranty”), dated as of January 7, 2019, is made and entered into by Celanese Corporation, a corporation incorporated under the laws of Delaware (“Holdings”), in favor of Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent (for the benefit of the Guarantee Beneficiaries), in connection with the Credit Agreement.WHEREAS,  Holdings is party to that certain Credit Agreement (as amended, restated, amended and restated, waived, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the “Credit Agreement”; capitalized terms used but not defined in this Guaranty being used herein with the definitions provided therefor in the Credit Agreement), dated as of the date hereof, by and among Holdings, Celanese US Holdings LLC (the “Company”), Celanese Europe B.V.

The Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that the Administrative Agent and the other Guarantee Beneficiaries have rights to receive payments under and with respect to this Guaranty without setoff or counterclaim and, except as provided by applicable law (in which case adjustment, if any, shall be made as set forth in Section 3.01 of the Credit Agreement), without deduction for taxes, levies, duties, charges, compulsory loans, fees, imposts, restrictions or withholdings, in each case, as more fully set forth in the Credit Agreement.

Payments hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Guarantee Beneficiaries, payable according to the terms of the Credit Agreement.  The obligations hereunder shall not be affected by any acts of any legislative body or governmental authority affecting the Guarantor, any Borrower or any other guarantor, including but not limited to, any restrictions on the conversion of currency or repatriation or control of funds or any total or partial expropriation of the Guarantor’s or any Borrower’s or other guarantor’s property, or by economic, political, regulatory or other events in the countries where the Guarantor, any other guarantor or any Borrower is located.3.Rights of Guarantee Beneficiaries.  The Guarantor consents and agrees that each Guarantee Beneficiary may, at any time and from time to time, without notice or demand, and without affecting the enforceability or continuing effectiveness hereof: (a) amend, extend, renew, compromise, discharge, accelerate or otherwise change the time for payment or the terms of the Guaranteed Obligations  or any part thereof; (b) take, hold, exchange, enforce, waive, release, fail to perfect, sell, or otherwise dispose of any security for the payment of this Guaranty or any Guaranteed Obligations; (c) apply such security and direct the order or manner of sale thereof as any Guarantee Beneficiary in its sole discretion may determine; and (d) release or substitute one or more of any endorsers or other guarantors of or obligors in respect of any of the Guaranteed Obligations. The Guarantor hereby consents and agrees that (i) additional Borrowers may become party to the Credit Agreement after the date hereof, and this Guaranty shall remain in full force in effect (including with respect to Guaranteed Obligations incurred by such additional Borrowers), notwithstanding such addition and (ii) other guarantors may guarantee the Guaranteed Obligations, or any subset thereof, from time to time, and this Guaranty shall remain in full force and effect, notwithstanding any addition or release of such guarantors in any manner whatsoever. Without limiting the generality of the provisions set forth in this paragraph, the Guarantor consents to the taking of, or failure to take, any action which might in any manner or to any extent vary the risks of the Guarantor under this Guaranty or which, but for this provision, might operate as a discharge of the Guarantor.24.Certain Waivers.

The Guarantor expressly waives all presentments, demands for payment or performance, notices of nonpayment or nonperformance, protests, notices of protest, notices of dishonor and 

currence of new or additional Guaranteed Obligations. This Guaranty shall not be affected by the genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of the Guaranteed Obligations or any instrument or agreement evidencing any Guaranteed Obligations, or by the existence, validity, enforceability, perfection, non-perfection or extent of any collateral therefor, or by any fact or circumstance relating to the Guaranteed Obligations which might otherwise constitute a defense to the obligations of the Guarantor under this Guaranty, and the Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any defenses it may now have or hereafter acquire in any way relating to any or all of the foregoing.5.Obligations Independent.  The obligations of the Guarantor hereunder are those of primary obligor, and not merely as surety, and are independent of the Guaranteed Obligations and the obligations of any other guarantor, and a separate action may be brought against the Guarantor to enforce this Guaranty whether or not any Borrower, any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other person or entity is joined as a party. 6.Subrogation.  The Guarantor shall not exercise any right of subrogation, contribution, indemnity, reimbursement or similar rights with respect to any payments it makes under this Guaranty until all of the Guaranteed Obligations and any amounts payable under this Guaranty have been paid and performed in full and all commitments of the Lenders pursuant to the Loan Documents are terminated.  If any amounts are paid to the Guarantor in violation of the foregoing limitation, then such amounts shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Guarantee Beneficiaries and shall forthwith be paid to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Guarantee Beneficiaries to reduce the amount of the Guaranteed Obligations, whether matured or unmatured.7.Termination; Reinstatement.  This Guaranty is a continuing and irrevocable guaranty of all Guaranteed Obligations now or hereafter existing and shall remain in full force and effect until all Guaranteed Obligations and any other amounts payable under this Guaranty are paid in full in cash and any commitments of the Lenders pursuant to the Loan Documents are terminated.  3Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Guaranty shall continue in full force and effect or be revived, as the case may be, if any payment by or on behalf of the Borrowers, the Guarantor or any other guarantor is made, or a Guarantee Beneficiary exercises a right of setoff, in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations and such payment or the proceeds of such setoff or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Laws or otherwise, all as if such payment had not been made or such setoff had not occurred and whether or not the Administrative Agent is in possession of or has released this Guaranty and regardless of any prior revocation, rescission, termination or reduction.  The obligations of the Guarantor under this paragraph shall survive termination of this Guaranty.8.Subordination.  The Guarantor hereby subordinates the payment of all obligations and indebtedness of each Borrower owing to the Guarantor as subrogee of a Guarantee Beneficiary in respect of any performance by the Guarantor under this Guaranty, or otherwise resulting from the Guarantor’s performance under this Guaranty, to the indefeasible payment in full in cash of all Guaranteed Obligations.  If the Administrative Agent so requests, any such obligation or indebtedness of any Borrower to the Guarantor shall be enforced and performance received by the Guarantor as trustee for the Administrative Agent (for the benefit of the Guarantee Beneficiaries) and the proceeds thereof shall be paid over to the Administrative Agent on account of the Guaranteed Obligations, but without reducing or affecting in any manner the liability of the Guarantor under this Guaranty.9.Stay of Acceleration.  In the event that acceleration of the time for payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is stayed, in connection with any case commenced by or against the Guarantor or any Borrower under any Debtor Relief Laws, or otherwise, all such amounts shall nonetheless be payable by the Guarantor immediately upon demand by a Guarantee Beneficiary. 10.Expenses.

The obligations of the Guarantor under this paragraph shall survive the payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations and termination of this Guaranty.11.Miscellaneous.   No provision of this Guaranty may be waived, amended, supplemented or modified, except by a written instrument executed by the Administrative Agent and the Guarantor.  No failure by the Administrative Agent or any other Guarantee Beneficiary to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, remedy or power hereunder or otherwise shall operate as a waiver of any right, remedy or power hereunder; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy or power hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy.  The remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law or in equity.  The unenforceability or invalidity of any provision of this Guaranty shall not affect the enforceability or validity of any other provision herein.  This Guaranty embodies the entire agreement and understanding between the Guarantor and the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Guarantee Beneficiaries, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings relating to the subject matter hereof.

Each Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that the Administrative Agent and the other Guarantee Beneficiaries have rights to receive payments under and with respect to this Guaranty without setoff or counterclaim and, except as provided by applicable law (in which case adjustment, if any, shall be made as set forth in Section 3.01 of the Credit Agreement), without deduction for taxes, levies, duties, charges, compulsory loans, fees, imposts, restrictions or withholdings, in each case, as more fully set forth in the Credit Agreement. In furtherance thereof, Section 2.12 and Section 3.01 of the Credit Agreement is hereby incorporated into this Guaranty, mutatis mutandis.  Payments hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Guarantee Beneficiaries, payable according to the terms of the Credit Agreement. The obligations hereunder shall not be affected by any acts of any legislative body or governmental authority affecting any Guarantor, any Borrower or any other guarantor, including but not limited to, any restrictions on the conversion of currency or repatriation or control of funds or any total or partial expropriation of any Guarantor’s or any Borrower’s or other guarantor’s property, or by economic, political, regulatory or other events in the countries where any Guarantor, any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations or any Borrower is located.3.    Rights of Guarantee Beneficiaries.  Each Guarantor consents and agrees that any Guarantee Beneficiary may, at any time and from time to time, without notice or demand, and without affecting the enforceability or continuing effectiveness hereof:  (a) amend, extend, renew, compromise, discharge, accelerate or otherwise change the time for payment or the terms of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof; (b) take, hold, exchange, enforce, waive, release, fail to perfect, sell, or otherwise dispose of any security for the payment of this Guaranty or any Guaranteed Obligations; (c) apply such security and direct the order or manner of sale thereof as any Guarantee Beneficiary in its sole discretion may determine; and (d) release or substitute one or more of any endorsers of, other Guarantors of, other guarantors of or other obligors in respect of any of the Guaranteed Obligations.   Each Guarantor hereby consents and agrees that (i) additional Borrowers may become party to the Credit Agreement after the date hereof, and this Guaranty shall remain in full force in effect (including with respect to Guaranteed Obligations incurred by such additional Borrowers), notwithstanding such addition and (ii) other guarantors or Guarantors may guarantee the Guaranteed Obligations, or any subset thereof, from time to time, and this Guaranty shall remain in full force and effect, notwithstanding any addition or release of such other guarantors 2or Guarantors in any manner whatsoever. Without limiting the generality of the provisions set forth in this paragraph, each Guarantor consents to the taking of, or failure to take, any action which might in any manner or to any extent vary the risks of such Guarantor under this Guaranty or which, but for this provision, might operate as a discharge of such Guarantor.4.Certain Waivers.  Each Guarantor waives to the fullest extent permitted by law (a) any defense arising by reason of any disability or other defense of any Borrower, any other Guarantor or any other guarantor, or the cessation from any cause whatsoever (including any act or omission of any Guarantee Beneficiary) of the liability of any Borrower; (b) any defense based on any claim that such Guarantor’s obligations exceed or are more burdensome than those of any Borrower (or all Borrowers); (c) the benefit of any statute of limitations affecting such Guarantor’s liability hereunder; (d) any right to require the Administrative Agent to proceed against any Borrower, proceed against or exhaust any security for the Guaranteed Obligations, or pursue any other remedy in the Administrative Agent’s or any other Guarantee Beneficiary’s power whatsoever and any defense based upon the doctrines of marshalling of assets or of election of remedies; (e) any benefit of and any right to participate in any security now or hereafter held by any Guarantee Beneficiary; (f) any fact or circumstance related to the Guaranteed Obligations which might otherwise constitute a defense to the obligations of such Guarantor under this Guaranty; (g) any law or regulation of any jurisdiction or any other event affecting any term of a Guaranteed Obligation and (h) any and all other defenses or benefits that may be derived from or afforded by applicable law limiting the liability of or exonerating guarantors or sureties, other than the defense that the Guaranteed Obligations have been fully performed and paid in full in cash.  Each Guarantor expressly waives all presentments, demands for payment or performance, notices of nonpayment or nonperformance, protests, notices of protest, notices of dishonor an

ional Guaranteed Obligations. This Guaranty shall not be affected by the genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of the Guaranteed Obligations or any instrument or agreement evidencing any Guaranteed Obligations, or by the existence, validity, enforceability, perfection, non-perfection or extent of any collateral therefor, or by any fact or circumstance relating to the Guaranteed Obligations which might otherwise constitute a defense to the obligations of a Guarantor under this Guaranty, and each Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any defenses it may now have or hereafter acquire in any way relating to any or all of the foregoing.5.Obligations Independent.  The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder are those of primary obligor, and not merely as surety, and are independent of the Guaranteed Obligations and the obligations of any other guarantor and any other Guarantor, and a separate action may be brought against any Guarantor to enforce this Guaranty whether or not any Borrower, any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations, any other Guarantor, or any other person or entity is joined as a party. 6.Subrogation.  No Guarantor shall exercise any right of subrogation, contribution, indemnity, reimbursement or similar rights with respect to any payments it makes under this Guaranty until all of the Guaranteed Obligations and any amounts payable under this Guaranty have been paid and performed in full and all commitments of the Lenders pursuant to the Loan Documents are terminated.  If any amounts are paid to a Guarantor in violation of the foregoing limitation, then such amounts shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Guarantee Beneficiaries and shall forthwith be paid to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Guarantee Beneficiaries to reduce the amount of the Guaranteed Obligations, whether matured or unmatured.37.Termination; Reinstatement.  This Guaranty is a continuing and irrevocable guaranty of all Guaranteed Obligations now or hereafter existing and shall remain in full force and effect until all Guaranteed Obligations and any other amounts payable under this Guaranty are paid in full in cash and any commitments of the Lenders pursuant to the Loan Documents are terminated.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Guaranty shall continue in full force and effect or be revived, as the case may be, if any payment by or on behalf of the Borrowers, any Guarantor or any other guarantor is made, or a Guarantee Beneficiary exercises a right of setoff, in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations and such payment or the proceeds of such setoff or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Laws or otherwise, all as if such payment had not been made or such setoff had not occurred and whether or not the Administrative Agent is in possession of or has released this Guaranty and regardless of any prior revocation, rescission, termination or reduction.  The obligations of each Guarantor under this paragraph shall survive termination of this Guaranty.8.Subordination.  Each Guarantor hereby subordinates the payment of all obligations and indebtedness of each Borrower owing to such Guarantor as subrogee of a Guarantee Beneficiary in respect of any performance by such Guarantor under this Guaranty or otherwise resulting from such Guarantor’s performance under this Guaranty, to the indefeasible payment in full in cash of all Guaranteed Obligations.  If the Administrative Agent so requests, any such obligation or indebtedness of any Borrower to a Guarantor shall be enforced and performance received by such Guarantor as trustee for the Administrative Agent (for the benefit of the Guarantee Beneficiaries) and the proceeds thereof shall be paid over to the Administrative Agent on account of the Guaranteed Obligations, but without reducing or affecting in any manner the liability of any Guarantor under this Guaranty.9.Stay of Acceleration.  In the event that acceleration of the time for payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is stayed, in connection with any case commenced by or against any Guarantor or any Borrower under any Debtor Relief Laws, or otherwise, all such amounts shall nonetheless be payable by the Guarantors immediately upon demand by any Guarantee Beneficiary. 10.Expenses.  The Guarantors shall pay on demand all out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses) in any way relating to the enforcement, or protection of the Guarantee Beneficiaries’ rights, under this Guaranty or in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations, including any incurred during any “workout” or restructuring in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations and any incurred in the preservation, protection or enforcement of any rights of the Guaranteed Beneficiaries in any proceeding pursuant to or in connection with any Debtor Relief Laws, in each case in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement.  The obligations of the Guarantors under this paragraph shall survive the payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations and termination of this Guaranty.11.Miscellaneous.   No provision of this Guaranty may be waived, amended, supplemented or modified, except (i) as expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents or (ii) pursuant to a written instrument executed by the Administrative Agent and each affected Guarantor.  No failure by the Administrative Agent or any other Guarantee Beneficiary to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, remedy or power hereunder or otherwise shall operate as a waiver of any right, remedy or power hereunder; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy or power hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy.  The remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law or in equity.  The unenforceability or invalidity of any provision 4of this Guaranty shall not affect the enforceability or validity of any other provision herein. The unenforceability or invalidity of the Guaranty of any individual Guarantor or group of Guarantors shall not affect the enforceability or validity as relating to any other Guarantor.  This Guaranty embodies the entire agreement and understanding between the Guarantors and the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Guarantee Beneficiaries, and supersedes all prior agreements and understanding relating to the subject matter hereof.  Each Guarantor agrees to execute and deliver such documents and take such actions as may be requested by the Administrative Agent to effect the purposes of this Guaranty.  This Guaranty may be executed in counterparts, and each such counterpart shall form part of one and the same instrument.  This Guaranty may be executed and delivered by electronic means (including “PDF”), and such execution and delivery shall be deemed effective as a manually executed counterpart hereof.12.Condition of Borrowers.  Each Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that it has the sole responsibility for, and has adequate means of, obtaining from the Borrowers and any other guarantors and Guarantors (including Borrowers, guarantors and Guarantors added after the date hereof) such information concerning the financial condition, business and operations of the Borrowers and any such other guarantor or Guarantor as such Guarantor requires, and that the Administrative Agent and other Guarantee Beneficiaries have no duty, and no Guarantor is relying on the Administrative Agent or any Guarantee Beneficiary at any time, to disclose to any Guarantor any information relating to the business, operations or financial condition of the Borrowers or any other guarantor or Guarantor (each Guarantor waiving any duty on the part of the Administrative Agent and Guarantee Beneficiaries to disclose such information and any defense relating to the failure to provide the same).  13.Setoff.   Each Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that the Administrative Agent and the other Guarantee Beneficiaries have rights of setoff with respect to each Guarantor, as more fully set forth in the Credit Agreement.  In furtherance thereof, Section 10.08 of the Credit Agreement is hereby incorporated into this Guaranty, mutatis mutandis.  14.GOVERNING LAW; Assignment; Jurisdiction; Notices.  THIS GUARANTY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.  This Guaranty shall (a) bind each Guarantor and its successors and assigns, provided that a Guarantor may not assign its rights or obligations under this Guaranty without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (and any attempted assignment without such consent shall be void), and (b) inure to the benefit of the Administrative Agent (for the benefit of the Guarantee Beneficiaries) and its successors and assigns and the Administrative Agent and each Guarantee Beneficiary may, without notice to any Guarantor and without affecting any Guarantor’s obligations hereunder, assign, sell or grant participations in the Guaranteed Obligations and this Guaranty, in whole or in part.  Each Guarantor hereby irrevocably (i) submits to the jurisdiction of any state court sitting in the State of New York, County of New York and the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (and, in each case, appellate courts thereof) in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Guaranty, (ii) waives to the fullest extent permitted by law any defense asserting an inconvenient forum in connection therewith and (iii) agrees it will not bring action in any action, litigation or proceeding of any kind or description against the Administrative Agent or any Guarantee Beneficiary or any Affiliate thereof relating hereto or to any other Loan Document in any court, tribunal or similar, except those referenced in the foregoing clause (i). SERVICE OF PROCESS BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT IN CONNECTION WITH ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING SHALL BE BINDING ON A GUARANTOR IF DELIVERED TO THE 5COMPANY IN ACCORDANCE WITH DELIVERY OF NOTICES AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 10.02 OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT.  Each Guarantor agrees that the Administrative Agent and each Guarantee Beneficiary may disclose to any assignee of or participant in, or any prospective assignee of or participant in, any of its rights or obligations of all or part of the Guaranteed Obligations any and all information in its possession concerning such Guarantor, this Guaranty and any security for this Guaranty, except as may be expressly limited by the Credit Agreement.  All notices and other communications to a Guarantor under this Guaranty shall be in writing and delivered pursuant to Section 10.02 of the Credit Agreement.  Each Guarantor hereby irrevocably appoints the Company as its agent for service of process.15.    WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL; FINAL AGREEMENT. TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, EACH GUARANTOR AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT EACH IRREVOCABLY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY ACTION, CLAIM, SUIT OR PROCEEDING ON, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS GUARANTY, THE GUARANTEED OBLIGATIONS OR ANY LOAN DOCUMENT.  THIS GUARANTY REPRESENTS THE FINAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND MAY NOT BE CONTRADICTED BY EVIDENCE OF PRIOR, CONTEMPORANEOUS, OR SUBSEQUENT ORAL AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE PARTIES.  THERE ARE NO UNWRITTEN ORAL AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE PARTIES.16.Foreign Currency.  If the Administrative Agent so notifies the Guarantors in writing, at the Administrative Agent’s sole and absolute discretion, payments under this Guaranty shall be the Dollar Equivalent of the Guaranteed Obligations or any portion thereof, determined as of the date payment is made.  If any claim arising under or related to this Guaranty is reduced to judgment denominated in a currency (the “Judgment Currency”) other than the currencies in which the Guaranteed Obligations are denominated or the currencies payable hereunder (collectively the “Obligations Currency”), the judgment shall be for the equivalent in the Judgment Currency of the amount of the claim denominated in the Obligations Currency included in the judgment, determined as of the date of judgment.  The equivalent of any Obligations Currency amount in any Judgment Currency shall be calculated as set forth in Section 10.19 of the Credit Agreement. The Guarantors shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and the Guarantee Beneficiaries and hold the Administrative Agent and Guarantee Beneficiaries harmless from and against all loss or damage resulting from any change in exchange rates between the date any claim is reduced to judgment and the date of payment thereof by a Guarantor or any failure of the amount of any such judgment to be calculated as provided in this paragraph.17.Direct Obligations.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein and for the avoidance of doubt, this Guaranty is in addition to each Guarantor’s direct obligations with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations (including any direct obligations as a Borrower under the Loan Documents), and this Guaranty shall in no event operate to limit or reduce such direct obligations.18.Additional Guarantors.  Upon execution and delivery by any Subsidiary of the Company of (i) a joinder agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent (a “Guaranty Counterpart Agreement”), and (ii) such other documentation as be required by Section 6.13 of the Credit Agreement, such Person shall become a Guarantor hereunder with the same force and effect as if originally named as a Guarantor herein on the date hereof.  The execution, delivery and effectiveness of any such Guaranty Counterpart Agreement shall not require the consent of any other Guarantor, and shall not affect the Guaranty of any other Guarantor.  The 6rights and obligations of each party to this Guaranty shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding the addition of any such new party to this Guaranty.  Upon effectiveness of a Guaranty Counterpart Agreement, each reference to “Guarantor” in this Guaranty shall thereafter be deemed to include such joined Person.  For the avoidance of doubt, this paragraph 18 shall in no manner limit the Administrative Agent’s right to request alternative or additional guarantee documentation to the extent provided in the Credit Agreement, including pursuant to Section 6.13 thereof.19.Release of Guarantors.  Each party hereto acknowledges and agrees that, upon written request from the Company pursuant to Section 9.10 of the Credit Agreement and without the consent of any other Guarantor, the Administrative Agent shall release any Guarantor from this Guaranty, without in any manner affecting the Guaranty of the other Guarantors hereunder.  Any such request shall be subject to the terms and requirements set forth in Section 9.10 of the Credit Agreement, and, for the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent shall not be required to release any Guarantor, except to the extent expressly required  by such Section 9.10.[Remainder Intentionally Empty]7IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each Guarantor has caused this Guaranty to be duly executed as of the date first above written.[__],as Guarantor   By:  Name:  Title:  [Subsidiary Guaranty]Accepted and Agreed:BANK OF AMERICA, N.A.,as Administrative Agent   By:  Name:  Title:  [Subsidiary Guaranty]EXHIBIT HFORM OF DESIGNATED BORROWER REQUEST AND ASSUMPTION AGREEMENTDate:  ___________, _____To:Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative AgentLadies and Gentlemen:This Designated Borrower Request and Assumption Agreement is made and delivered pursuant to Section 2.14 of that certain Credit Agreement, dated as of January 7, 2019 (as amended, restated, extended, supplemented or otherwise modified in writing from time to time, the “Credit Agreement;” the terms defined therein being used herein as therein defined), among Celanese Corporation, a Delaware corporation, Celanese US Holdings LLC (the “Company”), a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of Delaware, Celanese Europe B.V., a private limited liability company incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands, Elwood C.V., a private limited company organized under the laws of the Netherlands, certain Subsidiaries of the Company from time to time party thereto as borrowers pursuant to Section 2.14 of the Credit Agreement, each Lender from time to time party thereto, Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, a Swing Line Lender and an L/C Issuer and the other Swing Line Lenders and L/C Issuers party thereto and reference is made thereto for fully particulars of the matters described therein.
