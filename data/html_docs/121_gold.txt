31





 
the proposed Letter of Credit is to be issued, the amount of such Letter of Credit, the currency in which such Letter of Credit is to be denominated, which shall be Dollars or an Offshore Currency, whether such Letter of Credit is to be transferable and the expiration date of such Letter of Credit (which shall not be later than the earlier of (i) one year from the date of issuance thereof and (ii) seven days prior to the Revolving Maturity Date (unless either (A) all of the Revolving Lenders and the applicable Issuing Lender have approved such expiration date or (B) such Letter of Credit is a Supported Letter of Credit or the Company confirms in writing to the applicable Issuing Lender not later than the seventh day prior to the Revolving Maturity Date that such Letter of Credit will be a Supported Letter of Credit on the Revolving Maturity Date and such Letter of Credit is in fact a Supported Letter of Credit on the Revolving Maturity Date; provided that such expiration date shall not be later than one year after the Revolving Maturity Date)).  So long as the applicable Issuing Lender has not received written notice that the conditions precedent to the issuance of a Letter of Credit have not been satisfied, such Issuing Lender shall issue such Letter of Credit on the requested issuance date.  The applicable Issuing Lender shall promptly advise the Administrative Agent of the issuance of each Letter of Credit and of any amendment thereto, extension thereof or event or circumstance changing the amount available for drawing thereunder.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no Issuing Lender shall have any obligation to issue any Letter of Credit if (i) any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain such Issuing Lender from issuing such Letter of Credit, or any law applicable to such Issuing Lender or any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over such Issuing Lender shall prohibit, or request that such Issuing Lender refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit generally or such Letter of Credit in particular; (ii) the issuance of such Letter of Credit would violate any law, rule or regulation or any policy of such Issuing Lender; (iii) such Letter of Credit is to be denominated in a

ting Letters of Credit, on the Closing Date), the applicable Issuing Lender shall be deemed to have sold and transferred to each other Revolving Lender, and each other Revolving Lender shall be deemed irrevocably and unconditionally to have purchased and received from such Issuing Lender, without recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and participation, to the extent of such other Revolving Lenders Percentage, in such Letter of Credit (or, if applicable, all Existing Letters of Credit) and the Companys reimbursement obligations with respect thereto.  Each Revolving Lender agrees with each Issuing Lender that, if a draft is paid under any Letter of Credit for which the Issuing Lender is not reimbursed in full by the Company (or applicable Subsidiary) in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (or in the event that any reimbursement received by the applicable Issuing
 
32





 
Lender shall be required to be returned by it at any time), such Revolving Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Issuing Lender upon demand an amount equal to such Revolving Lenders Percentage of the amount that is not so reimbursed (or is so returned).  Each Revolving Lenders obligation to pay such amount shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (i) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right that such Revolving Lender may have against the Issuing Lender, the Company or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (ii) the occurrence or continuance of a Unmatured Event of Default or Event of Default or the failure to satisfy any of the other conditions specified in Section 11, (iii) any adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise) of the Company or its Subsidiaries, (iv) any breach of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by the Company, any other Loan Party or any other Lender or (v) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing.  Each Issuing Lender hereby agrees, upon request of the Administrative Agent or any Revolving Lender, to deliver to such Revolving Lender a list of all outstanding Letters of Credit, together with such information related thereto as such Revolving Lender may reasonably request.
 
If any amount required to be paid by any Revolving Lender to an Issuing Lender pursuant to this Section 2.3.2 in respect of any unreimbursed portion of any payment made by such Issuing Lender under any Letter of Credit is paid to such Issuing Lender within three Business Days after the date such payment is due, such Revolving Lender shall pay to such Issuing Lender on demand an amount equal to the product of (i) the Dollar Equivalent of such amount, times (ii) the daily average Federal Funds Rate during the period from and including the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to such Issuing Lender, times (iii) a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days that elapse during such period and the denominator of which is 360.  If any such amount required to be paid by any Revolving Lender pursuant to this Section 2.3.2 is not made available to such Issuing Lender by such Revolving Lender within three Business Days after the date such payment is due, such Issuing Lender shall be entitled to recover from such Revolving Lender, on demand, such amount with interest thereon calculated from such due date at the rate per annum applicable to Base Rate Loans that are Revolving Loans.  A certificate of an Issuing Lender submitted to any applicable Revolving Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this Section 2.3.2 shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.
 
2.3.3                     Reimbursement Obligations.  Upon an Issuing Lenders determination that documents presented by the Letter of Credit beneficiary or transferee thereof for payment under a Letter of Credit are in compliance with the terms and conditions thereof, the applicable Issuing Lender will promptly notify the Company and the Administrative Agent that compliant documents have been received and informing them of the Honor Date.  The Company shall (or, if the applicable Letter of Credit was issued jointly for the account of the Company and a Subsidiary, shall cause such Subsidiary to) reimburse the applicable Issuing Lender through the Administrative Agent prior to 11:00 a.m. (Local Time) on each date that any amount is paid by such Issuing Lender under any Letter of Credit (each such date, an Honor Date); provided that if the Company does not receive notice of the amount paid by the applicable Issuing Lender prior to 10:00 a.m. (Local Time) on such Honor Date, the Company shall (or shall cause the applicable Subsidiary to) reimburse such Issuing Lender, in the same currency as was paid by such Issuing Lender or, at the Companys option, in an amount in Dollars equal to the Dollar Equivalent of the amount so paid by such Issuing Lender, not later than 10:00 a.m. (Local Time) on the
 
33





 
Business Day immediately following the date on which the Company receives notice of the amount so paid by such Issuing Lender (and such reimbursement shall include interest for the period from the Honor Date to the date of reimbursement at the Base Rate (or such other rate as the Company and such Issuing Lender shall agree) on the Dollar Equivalent of the amount so reimbursed).  If the Company (or if the applicable Letter of Credit was issued jointly for the account of the Company and a Subsidiary, the Company or such Subsidiary) fails to reimburse the applicable Issuing Lender for the full amount of any drawing under any Letter of Credit by the time specified in the previous sentence, at the option of the applicable Issuing Lender, the Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Revolving Lender thereof, and the Company shall be deemed to have requested that Base Rate Revolving Loans in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of such unreimbursed amount be made by Revolving Lenders on the date the Administrative Agent provides such notice (or, if such notice is provided by the Administrative Agent after 11:00 a.m. (Local Time) on any Business Day, on the immediately following Business Day, subject to the amount of the unutilized portion of the Revolving Commitment and subject to the conditions set forth in Section 11.2).  Any notice given by an Issuing Lender or the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 2.3.3 may be oral if immediately confirmed in writing (including by electronic communication); provided that the lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice.
 
2.3.4                     Limitation on Obligations of Issuing Lender.  In determining whether to pay under any Letter of Credit, no Issuing Lender shall have any obligation to the Company or any Revolving Lender other than to confirm that any documents required to be delivered under such Letter of Credit appear to have been delivered and appear to comply on their face with the requirements of such Letter of Credit.  The parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Lender may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.  Any action taken or omitted to be taken by the applicable Issuing Lender under or in connection with any Letter of Credit, if taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence and willful misconduct, shall not impose upon such Issuing Lender any liability to the Company, its Subsidiaries or any Revolving Lender and shall not reduce or impair the Companys reimbursement obligations set forth in Section 2.3.3 or the obligations of the Revolving Lenders pursuant to Section 2.3.5.
 
2.3.5                     Funding by Revolving Lenders.  Each Revolving Lender shall upon any notice pursuant to Section 2.3.3 make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Issuing Lender an amount in Dollars and in immediately available funds equal to its Percentage of the Dollar Equivalent of the amount of the applicable drawing, whereupon the participating Revolving Lenders shall (subject to Section 2.3.6) each be deemed to have made a Base Rate Revolving Loan to the Company in that amount.  If any Revolving Lender so notified fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Issuing Lender the amount of such Revolving Lenders Percentage of the Dollar Equivalent of the amount of the applicable drawing by 12:00 noon (Local Time) on the Honor Date, then interest shall accrue on such amount, from the Honor Date to the date such Revolving Lender makes such payment, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate in effect from time to time during such period.  The Administrative Agent will promptly give notice of the occurrence of the
 
34





 
Honor Date, but failure of the Administrative Agent to give any such notice on the Honor Date or in sufficient time to enable any Revolving Lender to effect such payment on such date shall not relieve such Revolving Lender from its obligations under this Section 2.3.5.
 
2.3.6                     L/C Borrowings.  With respect to any unreimbursed drawing that is not converted into Base Rate Revolving Loans to the Company in whole or in part, because of the Companys failure to satisfy the conditions set forth in Section 11.2 or for any other reason, the Company shall be deemed to have incurred from the applicable Issuing Lender an L/C Borrowing in the Dollar Equivalent of the amount of such drawing, which L/C Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Base Rate Margin plus 2.0% per annum, and each Revolving Lenders payment to such Issuing Lender pursuant to Section 2.3.5 shall be deemed payment in respect of its participation in such L/C Borrowing and shall constitute an L/C Advance from such Revolving Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this Section 2.3.
 
2.3.7                     Repayment of Participations.  Upon (and only upon) receipt by the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Issuing Lender of immediately available funds from or on behalf of the Company (a) in reimbursement of any payment or disbursement under a Letter of Credit with respect to which a Revolving Lender has paid the Administrative Agent for the account of such Issuing Lender the amount of such Revolving Lenders participation therein or (b) in payment of any interest thereon, the Administrative Agent will pay to such Revolving Lender its pro rata share (according to its Percentage) thereof (and such Issuing Lender shall receive the amount otherwise payable to any Revolving Lender which did not so pay the Administrative Agent the amount of such Revolving Lenders participation in such payment or disbursement).
 
2.3.8                     Obligations Unconditional.  Each Revolving Lenders obligation in accordance with this Agreement to make the Revolving Loans or L/C Advances, as contemplated by this Section 2.3, as a result of a drawing under a Letter of Credit, shall be absolute and unconditional and without recourse to the applicable Issuing Lender and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (a) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Revolving Lender may have against such Issuing Lender, the Company or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (b) the occurrence or continuance of an Event of Default, an Unmatured Event of Default or a Material Adverse Effect; or (c) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; provided that each Revolving Lenders obligation to make Revolving Loans under this Secti

y such Issuing Lender under any Letter of Credit to any Person purporting to be a trustee in bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidator, receiver or other representative of or successor to any beneficiary or any transferee of any Letter of Credit, including any arising in connection with any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceeding;
 
(f)                                   any exchange, release or non-perfection of any collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any other guarantee, for all or any of the obligations of the Company in respect of any Letter of Credit; or
 
(g)                                  any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, including any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the Company or a guarantor.
 
Neither the Administrative Agent, the Lenders nor any Issuing Lender, nor any of their Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of an Issuing Lender; provided that nothing in this Section 2.3.9 shall be construed to excuse an Issuing Lender from liability to the Company to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages) suffered by the Company or any Subsidiary that are caused by such Issuing Lende

ll of the Swing Line Lenders.  Amounts borrowed under this Section 2.4 may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed until the Revolving Maturity Date; provided that all outstanding Swing Line Loans shall be due and payable in full upon the earliest of (x) any borrowing of Revolving Loans, (y) the date that is five Business Days after the making of such Swing Line Loan and (z) the Revolving Maturity Date.
 
37





 
The failure of any Swing Line Lender to make its ratable portion of a Swing Line Loan shall not relieve any other Swing Line Lender of its obligation hereunder to make its ratable portion of such Swing Line Loan on the date of such Swing Line Loan, but no Swing Line Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Swing Line Lender to make the ratable portion of a Swing Line Loan to be made by such other Swing Line Lender on the date of any Swing Line Loan.
 
2.4.2                     Swing Line Loan Procedures.  The Company shall give written or telephonic notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly inform the Swing Line Lenders) of each proposed Swing Line Loan not later than 2:00 p.m. (New York City time)  on the proposed date of such Swing Line Loan.  Each such notice shall be effective upon receipt by the Administrative Agent and shall specify the date and amount of such Swing Line Loan, which shall be $50,000 or a higher integral multiple thereof.  So long as the Swing Line Lenders have not received written notice that the conditions precedent set forth in Section 11 with respect to the making of such Swing Line Loans have not been satisfied, each Swing Line Lender shall pay over its ratable portion of the requested amount to the Company on the requested borrowing date (such ratable portion to be calculated based upon such Swing Line Lenders Revolving Commitment to the total Revolving Commitments of all the Swing Line Lenders).  Concurrently with the making of any Swing Line Loan, such Swing Line Lender shall be deemed to have sold and transferred, and each Revolving Lender shall be deemed to have purchased and received from such Swing Line Lender, an undivided interest and participation to the extent of such Revolving Lenders Percentage in such Swing Line Loan (but such participation shall remain unfunded until required to be funded pursuant to Section 2.4.3).
 
2.4.3                     Refunding of, or Funding of Participations in, Swing Line Loans.  Any applicable Swing Line Lender may at any time, in its sole discretion, upon at least three Business Days notice (or same day notice if an Event of Default exists) to the Company and the Administrative Agent (it being understood that any notice delivered after 9:00 a.m. (New York City time) shall be deemed received on the next Business Day), on behalf of the Company (which hereby irrevocably authorizes each Swing Line Lender to act on its behalf) deliver a notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly notify each Revolving Lender of its receipt thereof) requesting that each Revolving Lender (including such Swing Line Lender in its individual capacity) make a Revolving Loan (which shall be a Base Rate Loan unless the Company makes a timely request for a borrowing of Eurodollar Loans denominated in Dollars) on the date specified in such notice in such Revolving Lenders Percentage of the aggregate amount of Swing Line Loans outstanding on such date for the purpose of repaying all Swing Line Loans (and, upon receipt of the proceeds of such Revolving Loans, the Administrative Agent shall apply such proceeds to repay Swing Line Loans); provided that if the conditions precedent to a borrowing of Revolving Loans are not then satisfied or for any other reason the Revolving Lenders may not then make Revolving Loans, then instead of making Revolving Loans each Revolving Lender shall become immediately obligated to fund its participation in all outstanding Swing Line Loans and shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Swing Line Lenders an amount equal to such Revolving Lenders Percentage of such Swing Line Loans.  If and to the extent any Revolving Lender shall not have made such amount available to the Administrative Agent by 2:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the Business Day on which such Revolving Lender receives notice from the Administrative Agent of its obligation
 
38





 
to fund its participation in Swing Line Loans (it being understood that any such notice received after 12:00 noon (New York City time) on any Business Day shall be deemed to have been received on the next following Business Day), such Revolving Lender agrees to pay interest on such amount to the Administrative Agent for the Swing Line Lenders accounts forthwith on demand for each day from the date such amount was to have been delivered to the Administrative Agent to the date such amount is paid, at a rate per annum equal to (a) for the first three days after demand, the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect and (b) thereafter, the Base Rate plus the Base Rate Margin from time to time in effect.  Any Revolving Lenders failure to make available to the Administrative Agent its Percentage of the amount of all outstanding Swing Line Loans shall not relieve any other Revolving Lender of its obligation hereunder to make available to the Administrative Agent such other Revolving Lenders Percentage of such amount, but no Revolving Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Revolving Lender to make available to the Administrative Agent such other Revolving Lenders Percentage of any such amount.
 
2.4.4                     Repayment of Participations.  Upon (and only upon) receipt by the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swing Line Lenders of immediately available funds from or on behalf of the Company (a) in reimbursement of any Swing Line Loan with respect to which a Revolving Lender has paid the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swing Line Lenders the amount of such Revolving Lenders participation therein or (b) in payment of any interest on a Swing Line Loan, the Administrative Agent will pay to such Revolving Lender its pro rata share (according to its Percentage) thereof (and the Swing Line Lender shall receive the amount otherwise payable to any Revolving Lender which did not so pay the Administrative Agent the amount of such Revolving Lenders participation in such Swing Line Loan).
 
2.4.5                     Participation Obligations Unconditional.  (a) Each Revolving Lenders obligation to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swing Line Lenders the amount of its participation interest in all Swing Line Loans as provided in Section 2.4.3 shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (i) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Revolving Lender may have against any Swing Line Lender or any other Person, (ii) the occurrence or continuance of an Event of Default or Unmatured Event of Default, (iii) any adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise) of the Company or any Subsidiary thereof, (iv) any termination of the Commitments or (v) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever.
 
(b)                                 Notwithstanding the provisions of clause (a) above, no Revolving Lender shall be required to purchase a participation interest in any Swing Line Loan if, prior to the making by the Swing Line Lenders of such Swing Line Loan, such Swing Line Lenders received written notice specifying that one or more of the conditions precedent to the making of such Swing Line Loan were not satisfied and, in fact, such conditions precedent were not satisfied at the time of the making of such Swing Line Loan.
 
2.5                               Commitments Several.  The failure of any Lender to make a requested Loan on any date shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation (if any) to make a Loan on such date, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make any Loan to be made by such other Lender.
 
39





 
2.6                               Certain Conditions.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no Lender shall have an obligation to make any Loan, and no Issuing Lender shall have any obligation to issue any Letter of Credit, if an Event of Default or Unmatured Event of Default exists.
 
2.7                               Subsidiary Borrowers.  (a) On or after the Closing Date, with the consent of the Administrative Agent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), the Company may designate any wholly-owned Subsidiary (other than any Securitization Subsidiary) as a Subsidiary Borrower by delivery to the Administrative Agent of a Subsidiary Borrower Supplement executed by such Subsidiary and the Company, together with a Note in favor of each requesting Revolving Lender, and such Subsidiary shall for all purposes of this Agreement be a Subsidiary Borrower and party to this Agreement (until its status as a Subsidiary Borrower is terminated in accordance with clause (c) below).  As soon as practicable upon receipt of a Subsidiary Borrower Supplement, the Administrative Agent will deliver a copy thereof to each Revolving Lender.
 
(b)                                 Notwithstanding the foregoing clause (a), (i) no Subsidiary Borrower that is a Domestic Subsidiary may borrow Revolving Loans prior to the fifth Business Day after the Administrative Agent has distributed copies of the applicable Subsidiary Borrower Supplement pursuant to the last sentence of clause (a) and (ii) no Subsidiary Borrower that is a Foreign Subsidiary may (x) borrow Revolving Loans prior to the tenth Business Day after the Administrative Agent has distributed copies of the applicable Subsidiary Borrower Supplement pursuant to the last sentence of clause (a) or (y) borrow or maintain Revolving Loans if any Lender has notified the Administrative Agent (which notice has not been withdrawn) that such Lender has determined in good faith that (A) as of the date such Subsidiary Borrower is eligible to borrow Revolving Loans pursuant to the foregoing clause (b)(ii)(x) or (B) as the result of the introduction of, any change in, or any change in the interpretation or administration of any applicable law or regulation or any guideline or request from any central bank or other Governmental Authority (whether or not having the force of law), in each case described in this clause (B) after the date on which such Subsidiary Borrower was first eligible to borrow pursuant to the foregoing clause (b)(ii)(x), such Lender cannot make or maintain Loans to such Subsidiary Borrower without (1) adverse tax or legal consequences (including any consequences resulting from exchange controls or capital controls) unless such consequences only involve the payment of money, in which case such Subsidiary Borrower may borrow and maintain Revolving Loans if it agrees to pay such Lender such amounts as such Lender determines in good faith are necessary to compensate such Lender for such consequences, or such consequences relate to FATCA or (2) violating (or raising a substantial question as to whether such Lender would violate) any applicable law or regulation or any guideline or request from any central bank or other Governmental Authority (whether or not having the force of law).
 
(c)                                  So long as the principal of and interest on all Loans made to any Subsidiary Borrower under this Agreement shall have been paid in full and all other obligations of such Subsidiary Borrower in such capacity (other than any contingent indemnification or similar obligation not yet due and payable) shall have been fully performed, such Subsidiary Borrower may, upon not less than five Business Days prior written notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly notify the Lenders thereof), terminate its status as a Subsidiary Borrower.

2.8                               Utilization of Commitments in Offshore Currencies; Valuation.
 
(a)                                 The Administrative Agent will determine the Dollar Equivalent amount of each Eurodollar Loan and each Letter of Credit denominated in a currency other than Dollars on each Computation Date, and such determination shall be conclusive absent demonstrable error.  The Administrative Agent will provide the Company with the amount so determined upon request and, in any event, promptly following the end of each month.
 
(b)                                 Upon receipt of any notice of borrowing of Offshore Currency Loans, the Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Revolving Lender of the approximate amount of such Revolving Lenders Percentage of such borrowing, and the Administrative Agent will, upon the determination of the Dollar Equivalent amount of the borrowing as specified in such notice of borrowing, promptly notify each Revolving Lender of the exact amount of such Revolving Lenders Percentage of such borrowing.  In the case of a proposed borrowing comprised of Offshore Currency Loans, the Revolving Lenders shall be under no obligation to make Offshore Currency Loans in the requested Offshore Currency as part of such borrowing if the Administrative Agent has received notice from any Revolving Lender by 10:00 a.m. (Local Time) three Business Days prior to the day of such borrowing that such Revolving Lender cannot provide Loans in such Offshore Currency without adverse tax or legal consequences (excluding consequences relating to FATCA), in which event the Administrative Agent will give notice to the Company no later than 4:00 p.m. (Local Time) three Business Days prior to the requested date of such borrowing that a borrowing in such Offshore Currency is not then available, no such borrowing shall be made and any request for a Revolving Loan in such Offshore Currency shall be deemed withdrawn and shall otherwise be without effect.
 
(c)                                  In the case of a proposed continuation of Offshore Currency Loans for an additional Interest Period pursuant to Section 2.2.3, the Revolving Lenders shall be under no obligation to continue such Offshore Currency Loans if the Administrative Agent has received notice from any of the Revolving Lenders by 10:00 a.m. (Local Time) three Business Days prior to the day of such continuation that such Revolving Lender cannot continue to provide Loans in the applicable Offshore Currency, in which event the Administrative Agent will give notice to the Company not later than 4:00 p.m. (Local Time) three Business Days prior to the requested date of such continuation that the continuation of such Offshore Currency Loans in such Offshore Currency is not then available, and notice thereof also will be given promptly by the Administrative Agent to the Revolving Lenders.  If the Administrative Agent shall have so notified the Company that any such continuation of Offshore Currency Loans is not then available, any notice of continuation with respect thereto shall be deemed withdrawn and such Offshore Currency Loans shall be redenominated into Revolving Loans consisting of Base Rate Loans assumed by the Company in Dollars with effect from the last day of the Interest Period with respect to any such Offshore Currency Loans.  The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Company and the Revolving Lenders of any such redenomination and in such notice by the Administrative Agent to each Revolving Lender the Administrative Agent will state the aggregate Dollar Equivalent amount of the redenominated Offshore Currency Loans assumed by the Company as of the Computation Date with respect thereto and the amount of such redenominated Offshore Currency Loans outstanding for the account of each applicable Revolving Lender.
 
41





 
(d)                                 The Company shall be entitled to request that Revolving Loans hereunder shall also be permitted to be made in any other lawful currency, in addition to Dollars and the currencies specified in the definition of Offshore Currency, that in the opinion of each Revolving Lender is at such time freely traded in the offshore interbank foreign exchange markets and is freely transferable and freely convertible into Dollars (an Agreed Alternative Currency).  The Company shall deliver to the Administrative Agent any request for designation of an Agreed Alternative Currency in accordance with Section 14.3, to be received by the Administrative Agent not later than noon (New York City time) at least ten Business Days in advance of the date of any borrowing hereunder proposed to be made in such Agreed Alternative Currency.  Upon receipt of any such request the Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Revolving Lenders thereof, and each Revolving Lender will use its best efforts to respond to such request within two Business Days of receipt thereof.  Each Revolving Lender may grant or deny such request in its sole discretion.  The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Company of the acceptance or rejection of any such request.
 
2.9                               Additional Cash Collateral.  At any time that there shall exist a Defaulting Lender, within one Business Day following the written request of the Administrative Agent or the applicable Issuing Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) the Company shall Cash Collateralize such Issuing Lenders Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender (determined after giving effect to Section 2.10(a)(iv) and any Cash Collateral provided by such Defaulting Lender).
 
(a)                                 The Company and, to the extent provided by any Defaulting Lender, such Defaulting Lender hereby grant to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of each Issuing Lender, and the Company and, as applicable, such Defaulting Lender, agree to maintain, a first priority security interest in all such Cash Collateral as security for the Defaulting Lenders obligation to fund participations in respect of Letters of Credit, to be applied pursuant to clause (b) below.  If at any time the Administrative Agent determines that Cash Collateral is subject to any right or claim of any Person other than the Administrative Agent and each Issuing Lender as herein provided (other than any Lien described in Section 10.8(a) or (h)), or that the total amount of such Cash Collateral is less than the aggregate Fronting Exposure the Company will, promptly upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay or provide to the Administrative Agent additional Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to eliminate such deficiency (after giving effect to any Cash Collateral provided by the Defaulting Lenders).
 
(b)                                 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Cash Collateral provided under this Section 2.9 or Section 2.10 in respect of Letters of Credit shall be applied to the satisfaction of the Defaulting Lenders obligation to fund participations in respect of Letters of Credit (including, as to Cash Collateral provided by a Defaulting Lender, any interest accrued on such obligation) for which the Cash Collateral was so provided, prior to any other application of such property as may otherwise be provided for herein.
 
(c)                                  Cash Collateral (or the appropriate portion thereof) provided to reduce any Issuing Lenders Fronting Exposure shall no longer be required to be held as Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section 2.9, and shall promptly be returned to the Company following (i) the elimination of the applicable Fronting Exposure (including by the termination of Defaulting Lender status of the applicable Lender), or (ii) the determination by the Administrative Agent
 
42





 
and the applicable Issuing Lender that there exists excess Cash Collateral; provided that, subject to Section 2.10, the Person providing Cash Collateral and such Issuing Lender may agree that Cash Collateral shall be held to support future anticipated Fronting Exposure or other obligations.
 
2.10                        Defaulting Lenders.
 
(a)                                 Defaulting Lender Adjustments.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or any other Loan Document, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as such Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable law:
 
(i)                                     Such Defaulting Lenders right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in Section 14.1.
 
(ii)                                  Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Section 12 or otherwise) or received by the Administrative Agent from a Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 7.5 shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder; second, to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to each Issuing Lender or each Swing Line Lender hereunder; third, to Cash Collateralize each Issuing Lenders Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender in accordance with Section 2.9; fourth, as the Company may request (so long as no Event of Default or Unmatured Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent; fifth, if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Company, to be held in a deposit account (as contemplated by the definition of Cash Collateralize in Section 1) and released pro rata in order to (x) satisfy such Defaulting Lenders potential future funding obligations with respect to Loans under this Agreement and (y) Cash Collateralize each Issuing Lenders future Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender with respect to future Letters of Credit issued under this Agreement, in accordance with Section 2.9; sixth, to the payment of amounts owing to the Lenders, each Issuing Lender or each Swing Line Lender as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender, any Issuing Lender or any Swing Line Lender against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement; seventh, so long as no Event of Default or Unmatured Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to a Borrower as a result of any judgment of

ing Swing Line Loans and the aggregate Stated Amount of all Letters of Credit to exceed such Non-Defaulting Lenders Revolving Commitment.  No reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from such Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a Non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such Non-Defaulting Lenders increased exposure following such reallocation.
 
(v)           If the reallocation described in clause (iv) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Company shall, without prejudice to any right or remedy available to it hereunder or under law, (x) first, ratably prepay Swing Line Loans in an amount equal to the Swing Line Lenders Fronting Exposure and (y) second, ratably Cash
 
44





 
Collateralize each Issuing Lenders Fronting Exposure in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.9.
 
(b)           Defaulting Lender Cure.  If the Company, the Administrative Agent, each Swing Line Lender and each Issuing Lender agree in writing that a Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any Cash Collateral or Backup Support), such Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Revolving Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Revolving Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans to be held pro rata by the Lenders in accordance with their respective Percentages (without giving effect to clause (a)(iv) above), whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lenders having been a Defaulting Lender.
 
(c)           New Swing Line Loans/Letters of Credit.  So long as any Revolving Lender is a Defaulting Lender, (i) no Swing Line Lender shall be required to fund any Swing Line Loan unless it is reasonably satisfied that it has no Fronting Exposure after giving effect to such Swing Line Loan and (ii) no Issuing Lender shall be required to issue, extend, renew or increase any Letter of Credit unless it is reasonably satisfied that it has no Fronting Exposure after giving effect thereto.
 
SECTION 3.         EVIDENCE OF DEBT.
 
3.1          Lender Records.  The Credit Extensions made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by the Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of business.  The accounts or records maintained by the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of the Credit Extensions made by the Lenders to the Borrowers and the interest and payments thereon.  Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of any Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing hereunder or under any other Loan Document.  In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error.  Upon the request of any Lender made through the Administrative Agent, the applicable Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative Agent) a promissory note substantially in the form of Exhibit A (each a Note), which shall evidence such Lenders Term Loan or Revolving Loans in addition to such accounts or records.  Each Lender may attach schedules to its Note (or Notes) and endorse thereon the date, type (if applicable), amount and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto.
 
45





 
3.2          Administrative Agent Records.  In addition to the accounts and records referred to in Section 3.1, each Lender and the Administrative Agent shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice accounts or records evidencing the purchases and sales by such Lender of participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans.  In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by the Administrative Agent and the accounts and records of any Lender in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error.
 
SECTION 4.         INTEREST.
 
4.1          Interest Rates; Default Interest.
 
4.1.1       Interest Rates for Loans.  Each Borrower promises to pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Loan made to it for the period commencing on the date such Loan is made until such Loan is paid in full as follows:
 
(a)           at all times such Loan is a Base Rate Loan, at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Base Rate Margin from time to time in effect; and
 
(b)           at all times such Loan is a Eurodollar Loan, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the Eurodollar Rate (Reserve Adjusted) applicable to each Interest Period for such Loan plus the Eurodollar Margin from time to time in effect.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by any Borrower hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such over

hat if at any time the Lenders become obligated to fund their participations in any Swing Line Loan pursuant to Section 2.4.3, such Swing Line Loan shall continue to bear interest at the rate applicable from time to time for Base Rate Loans pursuant to Section 4.1.1).
 
4.2          Interest Payment Dates.  Accrued interest on each Base Rate Loan (including any Swing Line Loan) shall be payable in arrears on the last Business Day of each calendar quarter and at maturity.  Accrued interest on each Eurodollar Loan shall be payable on the last day of each Interest Period relating to such Loan (and, in the case of a Eurodollar Loan with an Interest Period of six months or longer, on each three-month anniversary of the first day of such Interest Period) and at maturity.  After maturity, accrued interest on all Loans shall be payable on demand.
 
46





 
4.3          Setting and Notice of Eurodollar Rates.  The applicable Eurodollar Rate for each Interest Period shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, which shall give notice thereof to the Company and each Lender.  Each determination of the applicable Eurodollar Rate by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto, in the absence of demonstrable error.  The Administrative Agent shall, upon written request of the Company or any Lender, deliver to the Company or such Lender a statement showing the computations used by the Administrative Agent in determining any applicable Eurodollar Rate hereunder.
 
4.4          Computation of Interest.  All determinations of interest for Base Rate Loans (including any Swing Line Loan bearing interest at or by reference to the Base Rate) when the Base Rate is determined by the Prime Rate and all computations with respect to any amounts denominated in Canadian Dollars or Australian Dollars shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or, with regard to Base Rate Loans but not Canadian Dollars or Australian Dollars, 366 days, as the case may be, and the actual number of days elapsed.  All other computations of interest shall be computed for the actual number of days elapsed on the basis of a year of 360 days or on such other basis as the Administrative Agent shall determine is customary for the relevant currency.  The applicable interest rate for each Base Rate Loan shall change simultaneously with each change in the Base Rate.
 
SECTION 5.         FEES.
 
5.1          Non-Use Fee.  Subject to Section 2.10(a)(iii)(A), the Company agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Lender a non-use fee, for the period from the Closing Date to the Revolving Maturity Date, at a rate per annum equal to the Non-Use Fee Rate in effect from time to time of the daily average of the unused portion of such Revolving Lenders Revolving Commitment.  For purposes of calculating usage under this Section, the Revolving Commitment shall be deemed used to the extent of the sum of the aggregate Dollar Equivalent outstanding principal amount of all Revolving Loans (but not Swing Line Loans) and the Stated Amount of all Letters of Credit.  Such non-use fee shall be payable in arrears on the last Business Day of each calendar quarter and on the Revolving Maturity Date for any period then ending for which such non-use fee shall not have theretofore been paid.  The non-use fee shall be computed for the actual number of days elapsed on the basis of a year of 360 days.
 
5.2          Letter of Credit and Other Fees.  (a) The Company agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Revolving Lenders pro rata according to their respective Percentages a letter of credit fee for each Letter of Credit in an amount equal to the applicable L/C Fee Rate per annum in effect from time to time of the Dollar Equivalent of the undrawn amount of such Letter of Credit (computed for the actual number of days elapsed on the basis of a year of 360 days).  Such letter of credit fee shall be payable in arrears on the last Business Day of each calendar quarter and on the Revolving Maturity Date (and, if any Letter of Credit remains outstanding on the Revolving Maturity Date, thereafter on demand) for the period from the date of the issuance of each Letter of Credit to the date such payment is due or, if earlier, the date on which such Letter of Credit expired or was terminated.
 
47





 
(b)           The Company agrees to pay each Issuing Lender a fronting fee for each Letter of Credit in the amount separately agreed between the Company and such Issuing Lender from time to time.
 
(c)           In addition, with respect to each Letter of Credit, the Company agrees to pay to each Issuing Lender, for its own account, such fees and expenses as such Issuing Lender customarily requires in connection with the issuance, negotiation, processing and/or administration of letters of credit in similar situations.
 
(d)           The Company shall, without duplication to the fees referred to above in clauses (a), (b) and (c) pay, or cause to be paid, to the Administrative Agent and the Lead Arrangers (or their Affiliates) for their account (or that of their applicable Affiliates) such fees as separately agreed between the Company or its Subsidiaries and the Administrative Agent and/or the Lead Arrangers pursuant to any fee or similar letters.
 
SECTION 6.         CHANGES IN COMMITMENTS; PREPAYMENTS; AMORTIZATION; REPAYMENT OF LOANS.
 
6.1          Changes in Commitments.
 
6.1.1       Voluntary Reduction or Termination of the Revolving Commitment.  (a) The Company may from time to time on at least five Business Days prior written notice received by the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly advise each Lender thereof) permanently reduce the Revolving Commitment to an amount not less than the Revolving Credit Exposure.  Any such reduction shall be in an amount not less than $3,000,000 or a higher integral multiple of $1,000,000; provided that the Revolving Commitment may not be reduced to an amount that is less than the sum of (i) the outstanding Dollar Equivalent principal amount of Revolving Loans and Swing Line Loans (after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment thereof), and (ii) the Stated Amount of all Letters of Credit.  All reductions of the Revolving Commitment shall reduce the Revolving Commitment pro rata among the Revolving Lenders according to their respective pro rata share of the Revolving Commitments.
 
(b)           The Company may at any time on at least five Business Days prior written notice received by the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly advise each Revolving Lender thereof) terminate the Revolving Commitment upon payment in full of all Revolving Loans and Swing Line Loans and all other obligations of the Company hereunder in respect of such Revolving Loans and Swing Line Loans and Cash Collateralization in full or the provision of other Backup Support, pursuant to documentation in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to each Issuing Lender, of all obligations arising with respect to the Letters of Credit.  Each notice delivered by the Company pursuant to this clause (b) shall be irrevocable; provided that a notice of termination of the Commitments delivered by the Company may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Company (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied.
 
6.1.2       Mandatory Reduction of Commitments.  Unless previously terminated, the Revolving Commitment shall terminate on the Revolving Maturity Date and the Term Loan
 
48





 
Commitment (other than any Incremental Term Loan Commitments) shall terminate upon the making of the Term Loans on the Closing Date.  Any Incremental Term Loan Commitment shall terminate as provided in the applicable Incremental Assumption Agreement.
 
6.1.3       Incremental Term Loan Commitments.  (a) The Company may, by written notice to the Administrative Agent, request Incremental Term Loan Commitments in an aggregate amount not to exceed the Incremental Facility Amount at such time, from one or more Incremental Term Lenders (which may include any existing Lender willing to provide the same, in their own discretion); provided that each such Person, if not already a Lender hereunder, shall be subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent (acting reasonably).  Such notice shall set forth (i) the amount of the Incremental Term Loan Commitments being requested (which shall be in minimum increments of $1,000,000 and a minimum amount of $10,000,000 or equal to the remaining Incremental Facility Amount), the date on which such Incremental Term Loan Commitments are requested to become effective (which shall not be less than 10 Business Days nor more than 60 days after the date of such notice, unless otherwise agreed to by the Administrative Agent) and (iii) whether such Incremental Term Loan Commitments are to be Term Loan Commitments or commitments to make term loans with terms different from the Term Loans (Other Term Loans).
 
(b) The Company and each Incremental Term Lender shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Incremental Assumption Agreement and such other documentation as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably specify to evidence the Commitment of such Lender.  Each Incremental Assumption Agreement in respect of Incremental Term Loan Commitments shall specify the terms of the Incremental Term Loans to be made thereunder.
 
(c) The scheduled amortization and maturity of any Incremental Term Loans shall be as set forth in the applicable Incremental Assumption Agreement; provided that in no event shall (i) the final maturity date of any new Incremental Term Loans be earlier than the latest final maturity date of any then outstanding Class of Term Loans and (ii) the weighted average life to maturity of any new Incremental Term Loans be less than the weighted average life to maturity of any then outstanding Class of Term Loans.
 
(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Incremental Term Loan Commitment shall become effective under this Section 6.1.3 unless, (i) no Event of Default or Unmatured Event of Default exists or would result therefrom and (ii) the Administrative Agent shall have received certified copies of authorizing resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company authorizing such Incremental Term Loan Commitments.
 
6.1.4       Optional Increase in Revolving Commitment.  So long as no Event of Default or Unmatured Event of Default exists or would result therefrom and notwithstanding any contrary provision of Section 6.1.1, the Company may, by means of a letter to the Administrative Agent substantially in the form of Exhibit E, request that the Revolving Commitment be increased by (a) increasing the Revolving Commitment of one or more Revolving Lenders which have agreed to such increase (it being understood that no Revolving Lender shall have any obligation to increase its Revolving Commitment pursuant to this Section 6.1.4) and/or (b) adding one or more commercial banks or other Persons as a party hereto with a Revolving Commitment in an amount agreed to by any such commercial bank or other Person; provided
 
49





 
that (i) no commercial bank or other Person shall be added as a party hereto without the written consent of the Administrative Agent, the Swing Line Lenders and the Issuing Lenders (in each case, which shall not be unreasonably withheld); (ii) in no event shall the aggregate amount of all increases of the Revolving Commitment pursuant to this Section 6.1.4 exceed the Incremental Facility Amount; and (iii) no such increase shall increase the Offshore Currency Sublimit, the amount of the Swing Line Sublimit (without the consent of each Swing Line Lender) or the L/C Sublimit (without the consent of each Issuing Lender).  Any increase in the Revolving Commitment pursuant to this Section 6.1.4 shall be effective three Business Days (or such other period of time as may be agreed upon by the Company, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders or other Persons participating in such increase) after the date on which the Administrative Agent has (A) received certified copies of authorizing resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company authorizing such increase (or authorizing the maximum increase amount specified in clause (ii) above) and (B) received and accepted (such acceptance not to be unreasonably withheld) the applicable increase letter in the form of Annex 1 to Exhibit E (in the case of an increase in the Revolving Commitment of an existing Revolving Lender) or assumption letter in the form of Annex 2 to Exhibit E (in the case of the addition of a commercial bank or other Person as a new Lender).  The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Company and the Lenders of any increase in the Revolving Commitment pursuant to this Section 6.1.4 and of the Revolving Commitment of each Revolving Lender after giving effect thereto.  The Company acknowledges that, in order to maintain Loans in accordance with each Lenders pro rata share (based on their Revolving Commitments), a reallocation of the Commitments as a result of a non-pro-rata increase in the Revolving Commitment may require prepayment of all or portions of certain Loans on the date of such increase (and any such prepayment shall be subject to the provisions of Section 8.4).
 
6.2          Prepayments.
 
6.2.1       Any Borrower may from time to time prepay Loans in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, provided that the Company shall give the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly advise each Lender) notice thereof not later than (a) 2:30 p.m. (Local Time) (or, in the case of prepayment of Swing Line Loans, 4:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the date of such prepayment (which shall be a Business Day), in the case of Base Rate Loans and Swing Line Loans, and (b) two Business Days prior to the date of such prepayment, in the case of Eurodollar Loans, in each case specifying the Loans to be prepaid and the date and amount of prepayment.  Subject to Section 2.2.1, each partial prepayment of Revolving Loans shall be in a minimum amount such that the Dollar Equivalent thereof is $1,000,000 and an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof.  Each partial prepayment of Term Loans shall be in a minimum amount of $3,000,000 and an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof.  Prepayments of Revolving Loans shall be applied pro rata to the applicable Revolving Loans of all Revolving Lenders based on the outstanding amount thereof for the account of such applicable Revolving Lender.  Prepayments of Term Loans shall be applied pro rata to applicable Term Loans of all Term Lenders based on the outstanding amount thereof for the account of such applicable Term Lender.  Any prepayment of a Eurodollar Loan on a day other than the last day of an Interest Period therefor shall include interest on the principal amount being repaid and shall be subject to Section 8.4.  Each notice of prepayment under this Section 6.2.1 shall be irrevocable; provided that a notice delivered by the Company of the prepayment of Loans in connection with the termination of the Commitments pursuant to Section 6.1.1(b) may state that such notice is
 
50





 
conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Company (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied.
 
6.2.2       If on any date the aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure exceeds the aggregate Revolving Commitment, the Borrowers shall immediately, and without notice or demand, prepay the outstanding principal amount of the Revolving Loans and/or L/C Advances and/or Cash Collateralize (or promptly provide other Backup Support for) the outstanding Letters of Credit in an amount equal to such excess.
 
6.2.3       If at any time of calculation by the Administrative Agent (pursuant to Section 2.8(a) or otherwise), the sum of the Dollar Equivalent principal amount of all outstanding Offshore Currency Loans plus the Stated Amount of all Letters of Credit denominated in an Offshore Currency exceeds an amount equal to the lesser of (a) the aggregate Revolving Commitment and (b) 105% of the Offshore Currency Sublimit as a result of fluctuations in currency exchange rates, the applicable Borrowers shall, within two Business Days after receipt of notice thereof, prepay Offshore Currency Loans and/or Cash Collateralize (or promptly provide other Backup Support for) the Letters of Credit denominated in an Offshore Currency in an amount sufficient to cause the sum of the Dollar Equivalent principal amount of all outstanding Offshore Currency Loans plus the Stated Amount of all Letters of Credit denominated in an Offshore Currency to be less than or equal to the Revolving Commitment or the Offshore Currency Sublimit, respectively.
 
6.2.4       Mandatory Prepayme

l promptly (and in any event within five Business Days) apply 100% of the Net Cash Proceeds received with respect thereto to prepay outstanding Term Loans, it being agreed that to the extent no Term Loans are then outstanding at such time, to the extent any Revolving Loans are outstanding on such date, the Borrowers shall prepay Revolving Loans with such Net Cash Proceeds on such date).  Each prepayment of outstanding Loans required to be made pursuant to this paragraph shall be allocated pro rata between the Term Loans (including the Other Term Loans (if any)) or if applicable, Revolving Loans and, in the case of Term Loans, applied against the remaining scheduled installments of principal due in respect of the Term Loans, including (unless otherwise specified in the applicable Incremental Assumption Agreement) the Other Term Loans (if any) as directed by the Company.
 
(b) Notwithstanding clause (a) above, if (x) the Company shall deliver a certificate of an Executive Officer to the Administrative Agent at or promptly following the time of receipt of any amount that would otherwise constitute Net Cash Proceeds of an Asset Sale setting forth the Companys intent to reinvest such proceeds in productive assets or businesses within 365 days of receipt of such proceeds (the Investment Period) and (y) no Event of Default shall have occurred and shall be continuing at the time of the delivery of such certificate, such proceeds shall not constitute Net Cash Proceeds except to the extent not so used at the end of such Investment Period (or, if the Company commits to reinvest such proceeds within such Investment Period, within 180 days of the end of such Investment Period), at which time such proceeds shall be deemed to be Net Cash Proceeds.
 
51





 
(c) The Company shall not be required to prepay by any amount that would otherwise be required pursuant to clause (a) above to the extent (i) the relevant Net Cash Proceeds are generated by any Foreign Subsidiary and the repatriation to the C

reviously paid, all Term Loans shall be due and payable in full on the Term Loan Maturity Date.
 
6.3.3       Any prepayment of a Term Loan shall be applied to reduce the subsequent scheduled repayments of the Term Loans to be made pursuant to Section 6.3 as directed by the Company.
 
6.3.4       To the extent not previously paid, (i) all Revolving Loans shall be due and payable in full on the Revolving Maturity Date and (ii) all Swing Line Loans shall be due and payable in full on the earliest of (A) the date of any borrowing of Revolving Loans, (B) the Revolving Maturity Date and (C) the date that is five Business Days after the date such Swing Line Loans were made.
 
6.3.5       Repayments of Loans (not including Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans, but including Swing Line Loans) shall be accompanied by accrued interest on the amount repaid.
 
6.4          Extension of Revolving Maturity Date.  The Company may, by delivery of a Revolving Maturity Date Extension Request to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly
 
52





 
deliver a copy to each of the Revolving Lenders) not less than 45 days and not more than 85 days prior to any anniversary of the Closing Date, request that the Revolving Lenders extend the Revolving Maturity Date for an additional period set forth in such Revolving Maturity Date Extension Request (it being understood each Revolving Lender shall be offered the right to participate in such extension on the same terms and conditions as each other Revolving Lender).  Each Revolving Lender shall, by notice to the Company and the Administrative Agent given not later than the 20th day after the date of the Administrative Agents receipt of the Companys Revolving Maturity Date Extension Request, advise the Company whether or not it agrees to the requested extension (each Revolving Lender agreeing to a requested extension being called a Consenting Lender, and each Revolving Lender declining to agree to a requested extension being called a Declining Lender).  Any Defaulting Lender and any Revolving Lender that has not so advised the Company and the Administrative Agent by such day shall be deemed to have declined to agree to such extension and shall be a Declining Lender; provided that a Declining Lender (other than a Defaulting Lender) may, with the written consent of the Company, elect to become a Consenting Lender on the terms agreed by the other Consenting Lenders by written agreement with the Company and the Administrative Agent entered into at least two Business Days prior to the Revolving Maturity Date (or such later date as the Administrative Agent shall agree) theretofore in effect (such Revolving Maturity Date being called the Existing Maturity Date).  The Revolving Maturity Date shall, as to the Consenting Lenders, be extended to the date set forth in the Revolving Maturity Date Extension Request.  The decision to agree or withhold agreement to any Revolving Maturity Date Extension Request shall be at the sole discretion of each Revolving Lender.  The Revolving Commitment of any Declining Lender shall terminate on the Existing Maturity Date.  The principal amount of any outstanding Revolving Loans made by Declining Lenders, together with any accrued interest thereon and any accrued fees and other amounts payable to or for the account of such Declining Lenders hereunder, shall be due and payable on the Existing Maturity Date, and on the Existing Maturity Date the Borrowers shall also make such other prepayments of their Revolving Loans pursuant to Section 6.2 as shall be required in order that, after giving effect to the ter

s pursuant to this sentence, the sum of the Revolving Credit Exposures would not exceed the total Revolving Commitments.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph, the Company shall have the right, to the extent forth Section 8.7 (the Revolving Maturity Date Extension Request being deemed an amendment for such purposes), to replace a Declining Lender with one or more Revolving Lenders or other financial institutions that will agree to the applicable Revolving Maturity Date Extension Request, and each such replacement Revolving Lender or financial institution shall for all purposes constitute a Consenting Lender.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no extension of the Revolving Maturity Date pursuant to this paragraph shall become effective unless on the anniversary of the Closing Date that immediately follows the date on which the Company delivers the applicable Revolving Maturity Date Extension Request, the conditions set forth in Section 11.2 shall be satisfied and the Administrative Agent shall have received a certificate to that effect dated on such anniversary of the Closing Date and executed by an Executive Officer of the Company.
 
SECTION 7.         MAKING AND PRORATION OF PAYMENTS; SETOFF; TAXES.
 
7.1          Making of Payments.  All payments of principal of or interest on the Loans, and of all non-use fees and Letter of Credit fees, shall be made by the applicable Borrower to the
 
53

 




 
Administrative Agent at its principal office in New York, New York in immediately available funds (a) in the case of principal and interest payments with respect to Eurodollar Loans, in the Applicable Currency, and (b) in the case of any other amount, in Dollars or such other currency as shall be specified herein and without set-off, counterclaim or deduction of any kind, not later than noon on the date due, and funds received after that hour shall be deemed to have been received by the Administrative Agent on the next following Business Day.  The Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to each Lender its share (if any) of all such payments received in collected funds by the Administrative Agent.  All payments under Section 8.1 shall be made by the applicable Borrower directly to the Lender entitled thereto.
 
7.2          Application of Certain Payments.  Each payment of principal shall be applied to such Loans as the applicable Borrower shall direct by notice to be received by the Administrative Agent on or before the date of such payment or, in the absence of such notice, first, to repay such Loans outstanding as Base Rate Loans and then, to repay such Loans outstanding as Eurodollar Loans, with those Eurodollar Loans having earlier expiring Interest Periods being repaid prior to those having later expiring Interest Periods.  Concurrently with each remittance to any Lender of its share of any such payment, the Administrative Agent shall advise such Lender as to the application of such payment.
 
7.3          Due Date Extension or Reduction.  If any payment of principal or interest with respect to any of the Loans, or of any fees or other amounts, falls due on a day which is not a Business Day, then such due date shall be extended to the immediately following Business Day (unless, in the case of a payment of interest on a Eurodollar Loan, the result of such extension would be to extend the due date for such payment into another calendar month, in which case such due date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day) and any extension or reduction of time shall be reflected in computing interest and fees.
 
7.4          Failure to Make Payments.  Unless the applicable Borrower or a Lender has notified the Administrative Agent, prior to the date any payment to be made by it is due, that it does not intend to remit such payment, the Administrative Agent may, in its sole and absolute discretion, assume that such Borrower or such Lender, as the case may be, has timely remitted such payment and may, in its sole and absolute discretion and in reliance thereon, make available such payment to the Person entitled thereto.  If such payment was not in fact remitted to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds, then:
 
(i)            if the applicable Borrower failed to make such payment, each Lender shall forthwith on demand repay to the Administrative Agent the amount of such assumed payment made available to such Lender, together with interest thereon in respect of each day from the date such amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to such Lender to the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent at a rate per annum equal to, in the case of (a) amounts owed in Dollars (x) for the first three days after demand, the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect and (y) thereafter, the Base Rate from time to time in effect and (ii) in the case of amounts owed not denominated in Dollars, a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation; and
 
(ii)           if a Lender failed to make such payment, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Company, and the Company shall pay such corresponding amount to the
 
54





 
Administrative Agent, together with interest thereon in respect of each day from the date such amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to the Company at a rate per annum equal to the interest rate applicable to the applicable borrowing.  Nothing in this clause (ii) shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill its Commitment or to prejudice any rights which the Administrative Agent or the Company or any other Borrower may have against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder.
 
7.5          Setoff.  The Company agrees that the Administrative Agent and each Lender have all rights of set-off and bankers lien provided by applicable law, and in addition thereto, the Company agrees that at any time any Event of Default exists, the Administrative Agent, each Lender and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, any Affiliate thereof, may apply to the payment of any obligations of the Borrowers hereunder, whether or not then due, any and all balances, credits, deposits, accounts or moneys of the Borrowers then or thereafter with the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Affiliate; provided that if any Defaulting Lender shall exercise any such right of set-off, (a) all amounts so set off shall be paid over immediately to the Administrative Agent for further application in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.10 and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Lender and the Lenders, and (y) the Defaulting Lender shall provide promptly to the Administrative Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the obligations of the Borrowers as to which it exercised such right of set-off; provided further, that to the extent prohibited by applicable law as described in the definition of Excluded Swap Obligation, no amounts received from, or set off with respect to, any Guarantor shall be applied to any Excluded Swap Obligations of such Guarantor.  Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Company and the Administrative Agent after any such set-off and application made by such Lender or such Affiliate; provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application.
 
7.6          Proration of Payments.  If any Lender shall obtain any payment or other recovery (whether voluntary, involuntary, by application of offset or otherwise, but excluding any payment pursuant to Section 8.7 or in connection with an assignment or participation pursuant to Section 14.8 or any payment to any Swing Line Lender in respect of a Swing Line Loan prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default under Section 12.1.1 or 12.1.3 or any other payment or recovery made on a non-ratable basis pursuant to the express provisions of this Agreement or any other Loan Document) on account of principal of or interest on any Loan (or on account of its participation in any Letter of Credit or Swing Line Loan) in excess of its pro rata share (or other share specified hereunder or under any other applic

d by them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment or other recovery ratably with each of them; provided that if all or any portion of the excess payment or other recovery is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, the purchase shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery.
 
7.7          Taxes.  (a) All payments of principal of, and interest on, the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Taxes, except as required by applicable law.  If any withholding or deduction from any payment
 
55





 
to be made by a Loan Party hereunder is required in respect of any Taxes pursuant to any applicable law, then the Company will, or will cause each other applicable Loan Party to:
 
(i)            pay directly to the relevant Governmental Authority the full amount required to be so withheld or deducted;
 
(ii)           promptly forward to the Administrative Agent an official receipt or other documentation satisfactory to the Administrative Agent evidencing such payment to such Governmental Authority; and
 
(iii)          if such Taxes are Indemnified Taxes and except to the extent such withholding or deduction would not be required if such Lenders Exemption Representation were true as of the date made, pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Recipient such additional amount or amounts as is necessary to ensure that the net amount actually received by each Recipient will equal the full amount such Recipient would have received had no such withholding or deduction been required.
 
Moreover, if any Indemnified Taxes are directly asserted against the Administrative Agent or any Lender with respect to any payment received by the Administrative Agent or such Lender hereunder, the Administrative Agent or such Lender may pay such Indemnified Taxes and the applicable Loan Party will (except to the extent such Taxes are payable by a Lender and would not have been payable if such Lenders Exemption Representation were true as of the date made), promptly pay such additional amounts (including any penalty, interest and expense) as are necessary in order that the net amount received by such Person after the payment of such Indemnified Taxes (including any Indemnified Taxes on such additional amount) shall equal the amount such Person would have received had such Indemnified Taxes not been asserted, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally asserted.
 
(b)           If any Loan Party fails to pay any Indemnified Taxes when due to the appropriate taxing authority or fails to remit to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Recipient, the required receipts or other required documentary evidence, the Company shall indemnify each Recipient for any incremental Indemnified Taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable by any Recipient as a result of any such failure, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally asserted.
 
(c)           Each Lender represents and warrants (such Lenders Exemption Representation) to the Company and the Administrative Agent that, as of the date of this Agreement (or, in the case of an Assignee, the date it becomes a party hereto), it is entitled to receive payments hereunder without any deduction or withholding for or on account of any Taxes imposed by the United States of America or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof other than with respect to any Excluded Taxes.
 
(d)           Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Loan Parties to do so) and (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lenders failure to comply with the provisions of Section 14.8.2 relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register, in either case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in
 
56





 
connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this paragraph (c).
 
(e)           (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding.  In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Company or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 7.7(e)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in such Lenders reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lenders to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.
 
(ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
 
(A)                               any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Company or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax;
 
(B)                               any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Company or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:
 
(1)                                 in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable, establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal
 
57





 
withholding Tax pursuant to the interest article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, as applicable, establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the business profits or other income article of such tax treaty;
 
(2)                                 executed originals of IRS Form W-8ECI;
 
(3)                                 in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of t

de (a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate) and (y) executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable; or
 
(4)                                 to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed originals of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit I-2 or Exhibit I-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit I-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner;
 
(C)                               any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Company or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Company or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and
 
(D)                               if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to withholding Tax imposed pursuant to or in connection with FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable
 
58





 
reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent, such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Company and the Administrative Agent to comply with its obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has or has not complied with its obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.  Solely for purposes of this clause (D), FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
 
Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Company and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.
 
(f)            If, and to the extent that, any Recipient determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes indemnified or paid by the Company or another applicable Borrower pursuant to this Section 7.7, such Recipient agrees to promptly notify the Company thereof and thereupon to use reasonable efforts to pay to the Company an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such Recipient and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund). The Company, upon the request of such Recipient, shall repay to such  the amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph (f) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the even

nt to this paragraph (f) the payment of which would place the Recipient in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the Recipient would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid.  This paragraph shall not be construed to require any Recipient to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.
 
(g)           Each Lender shall, promptly upon request by the Company, deliver to the Company copies of all completed and executed forms reasonably deemed necessary by any Borrower in connection with the payment of amounts demanded by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing clause (a).
 
(h)           Each partys obligations under this Section 7.7 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the
 
59





 
replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document.
 
SECTION 8.         INCREASED COSTS; MARKET DISRUPTION.
 
8.1          Increased Costs.  (a)  If any Change in Law:
 
(i)            shall subject any Recipient (including any Eurodollar Office of a Lender) to any Taxes (other than  (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) with respect to its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations hereunder, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; or
 
(ii)           shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve (including any reserve imposed by the FRB, but excluding any reserve included in the determination of interest rates pursuant to Section 4), special deposit, liquidit

        shall impose on any Lender (or its Eurodollar Office) any other condition affecting its Loans or Letters of Credit, its Note or its obligation to make Loans or Letters of Credit;
 
and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to (or in the case of Regulation D of the FRB, to impose a cost on) such Lender (or any Eurodollar Office of such Lender) of making or maintaining any Loan or Letter of Credit, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender (or its Eurodollar Office) under this Agreement or under its Note with respect thereto (in each case after giving effect to any interest earned or to be earned on any reserve or special deposit of the type described in clause (ii) above), then within 10 Business Days after written demand by such Lender (which demand shall be accompanied by a statement setting forth the basis for such demand and a calculation of the amount thereof in reasonable detail, a copy of which shall be furnished to the Administrative Agent) to the Company, so long as such demand is substantially consistent with demands made by such Lender with similarly situated customers of such Lender under agreements having provisions similar to this Section 8.1(a), the Company shall, or shall cause each other applicable Borrower to, pay directly to such Lender such additional amount as will compensate such Lender for such increased cost or such reduction.
 
(b)           If any Lender shall reasonably determine that any Change in Law regarding capital adequacy or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lenders or its controlling Persons capital as a consequence of such Lenders obligations hereunder or under any Letter of Credit to a level below that which such Lender or such controlling Person could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lenders or such controlling Persons policies with respect to capital adequacy or liquidity requirements) by an amount reasonably deemed by such Lender or such controlling Person to be material, then from time to time, within 10 Business Days after written demand by such Lender (which demand shall be accompanied by a statement setting forth the
 
60





 
basis for such demand and a calculation of the amount thereof in reasonable detail, a copy of which shall be furnished to the Administrative Agent) to the Company, so long as such demand is substantially consistent with demands made by such Lender with similarly situated customers of such Lender under agreements having provisions similar to this Section 8.1(b), the Company shall, or shall cause each other applicable Borrower to, pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such controlling Person for such reduction.
 
8.2          Inability to Determine Rates, etc.
 
(a)           If at the time that the Administrative Agent shall seek to determine the Screen Rate on the Quotation Day for any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Loan, the Screen Rate shall not be available for such Interest Period for any reason and the Administrative Agent shall determine that it is not possible to determine the Interpolated Rate (which conclusion shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error), then the Reference Bank Rate shall be the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period for such Eurodollar Loan; provided that if any Reference Bank Rate shall be less than zero, such rate shall be deemed to be zero for purposes of this Agreement; provided, further, that if less than two Reference Banks shall supply a rate to the Administrative Agent for purposes of determining the Eurodollar Rate for such Eurodollar Loan, the Administrative Agent shall be deemed to have determined that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurodollar Rate for such Eurodollar Loan and Section 8.2 (b) shall apply.
 
(b)           If with respect to any Interest Period, the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be binding and conclusive on the Borrowers) that by reason of circumstances affecting the interbank Eurodollar market adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the applicable Eurodollar Rate; or
 
(c)           If with respect to any Interest Period, Lenders holding an aggregate outstanding amount of Term Loans, Revolving Loans and undrawn Revolving Commitments equal to at least 40% of all outstanding Term Loans, Revolving Loans and undrawn Revolving Commitments advise the Administrative Agent that the Eurodollar Rate (Reserve Adjusted) will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of maintaining or funding such Eurodollar Loans for such Interest Period (taking into account any amount to which such Lenders may be entitled under Section 8.1) or that the making or funding of Eurodollar Loans has become impracticable as a result of an event occurring after the date of this Agreement which in the opinion of such Lenders materially affects such Loans;
 
then the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the other parties thereof and, so long as such circumstances shall continue, (i) no Lender shall be under any obligation to make, continue or convert Loans into Eurodollar Loans, (ii) with respect to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate, the utilization of the Eurodollar Rate component in determining the Base Rate shall be suspended and (iii) on the last day of the current Interest Period for each Eurodollar Loan, such Loan shall, unless then repaid in full, automatically convert to a Base Rate Loan (it being understood that if such Loan is denominated in a currency other than Dollars, such Loan shall be redenominated in Dollars at the Spot Rate at such time to facilitate such conversion).  The Administrative Agent shall promptly revoke any such notice at such time as the applicable
 
61





 
circumstances shall no longer continue; provided that, in the case of any such notice made pursuant to clause (b) above, the Required Lenders shall have consented to such revocation.
 
8.3          Changes in Law Rendering Eurodollar Loans Unlawful.  In the event that any change after the date hereof in (including the adoption of any new) applicable laws or regulations, or any change after the date hereof in the interpretation of applicable laws or regulations by any governmental or other regulatory body charged with the administration thereof, should make it (or in the good faith judgment of any Lender cause a substantial question as to whether it is) unlawful for any Lender to make, maintain or fund Eurodollar Loans, then such Lender shall promptly notify each of the other parties hereto and, so long as such circumstances shall continue, (a) such Lender shall have no obligation to make or convert into Eurodollar Loans (but shall make Base Rate Loans, ignoring the Eurodollar Rate component in determining the Base Rate, concurrently with the making of or conversion into Eurodollar Loans by the Lenders which are not so affected, in each case in an amount equal to such Lenders pro rata share of all Eurodollar Loans which would be made or converted into at such time in the absence of such circumstances) and (b) on the last day of the current Interest Period for each Eurodollar Loan of such Lender (or, in any event, on such earlier date as may be required by the relevant law, regulation or interpretation), such Eurodollar Loan shall, unless then repaid in full, automatically convert to a Base Rate Loan and, if such Loan is denominated in a currency other than Dollars, such Loan shall be redenominated in Dollars at the Spot Rate (and such Lender will promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Company when such circumstances cease to exist, at which time such Lenders obligation to make Eurodollar Loans shall be reinstated).  Each Base Rate Loan made by a Lender which, but for the circumstances described in the foregoing sentence, would be a Eurodollar Loan (an Affected Loan) shall remain outstanding for the same period as the Group of Eurodollar Loans of which such Affected Loan would be a part absent such circumstances.
 
8.4          Funding Losses.  The Company hereby agrees that upon demand by any Lender (which demand shall be accompanied by a statement setting forth the basis in reasonable detail for the amount being claimed, a copy of which shall be furnished to the Administrative Agent), the Company will indemnify such Lender against any net loss (other than loss of Eurodollar Margin or profit) or expense which such Lender may sustain or incur (including any net loss or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Lender to fund or maintain any Eurodollar Loan), as reasonably determined by such Lender, as a result of (a) any payment, prepayment or conversion of any Eurodollar Loan of such Lender on a date other than the last day of an Interest Period for such Loan (including any conversion pursuant to Section 8.3) or (b) any failure of a Borrower to borrow, prepay or continue, or to convert any Loan into, a Eurodollar Loan on a date specified therefor in a notice of borrowing, prepayment, continuation or conversion pursuant to this Agreement.  For this purpose, all notices to the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be irrevocable.
 
8.5          Right of Lenders to Fund through Other Offices.  Each Lender may, if it so elects, fulfill its commitment as to any Loan by causing a foreign branch or affiliate of such Lender to make such Loan; provided that in such event for the purposes of this Agreement such Loan shall be deemed to have been made by such Lender and the obligation of the applicable
 
62





 
Borrower to repay such Loan shall nevertheless be to such Lender and shall be deemed held by it, to the extent of such Loan, for the account of such branch or affiliate.
 
8.6          Discretion of Lenders as to Manner of Funding.  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, each Lender shall be entitled to fund and maintain its funding of all or any part of its Loans in any manner it sees fit, it being understood, however, that for the purposes of this Agreement all determinations hereunder shall be made as if such Lender had actually funded and maintained each Eurodollar Loan during each Interest Period for such Loan through the purchase of deposits having a maturity corresponding to such Interest Period and bearing an interest rate equal to the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period.
 
8.7          Mitigation of Circumstances; Replacement or Removal of Affected Lender.  (a) Each Lender shall promptly notify the Company and the Administrative Agent of any event of which it has knowledge which will result in, and will use reasonable commercial efforts available to it (and not, in such Lenders good faith judgment, otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender) to mitigate or avoid, (i) any obligation by a Borrower to pay any amount pursuant to Section 7.7 or 8.1 or (ii) the occurrence of any circumstance of the nature described in Section 8.2 or 8.3 (and, if any Lender has given notice of any such event described in clause (i) or (ii) above and thereafter such event ceases to exist, such Lender shall promptly so notify the Company and the Administrative Agent).  Without limiting the foregoing, (x) each Lender will designate a different funding office if such designation will avoid (or reduce the cost to the applicable Borrower of) any event described in clause (i) or (ii) of the preceding sentence and such designation will not, in such Lenders good faith judgment, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender; and (y) if any Lender fails to notify the Company of any event or circumstance which will entitle such Lender to compensation pursuant to Section 7.7 or 8.1 within 90 days after such Lender obtains knowledge (or reasonably should have obtained knowledge) of such event or circumstance, then such Lender shall not be entitled to compensation from the applicable Borrower for any amount arising prior to the date which is 90 days before the date on which such Lender notifies the Company of such event or circumstance.
 
(b)           At any time any Lender is an Affected Lender, the Company may replace such Affected Lender as a party to this Agreement with one or more other bank(s) or financial institution(s) reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, such bank(s) or financial institution(s) to have Commitments in such amounts as shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and, in the case of an assignment of Revolving Commitments, each Swing Line Lender and each Issuing Lender (and upon notice from the Company such Affected Lender shall assign pursuant to an Assignment Agreement, and without recourse or warranty, its Commitment, its Loans, its Note (or Notes), its participation, if any, in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans and all of its other rights and obligations hereunder to such replacement bank(s) or other financial institution(s) for a purchase price equal to the sum of the principal amount of the Loans so assigned, all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, its ratable share of all accrued and unpaid fees thereon (including any non-use fees and Letter of Credit fees in the case of an assignment of Revolving Commitments), any amounts payable under Section 8.4 as a result of such Lender receiving payment of any Eurodollar Loan prior to the end of an Interest Period therefor and all other obligations then owed to such Affected Lender hereunder)

sion of this Agreement to the contrary, if (i) a Lender demands any payment pursuant to Section 8.1(a) and/or Section 8.1(b) and (ii) the payment so demanded is disproportionately greater than the amount of compensation (if any) that the Company is generally obligated to pay to other Lenders arising out of the same event or circumstance giving rise to such demand (a Trigger Event), then the Company may terminate such Lenders Commitments hereunder, provided that (w) no Event of Default or Unmatured Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such Commitment termination, (x) the Company concurrently terminates the Commitments of each other Lender that has made a demand for payment under Section 8.1(a) and/or 8.1(b) that arises out of such Trigger Event and that is similarly disproportionate to the amount the Company is generally obligated to pay to other Lenders arising out of such Trigger Event (together with such Lender, each a Demanding Lender), (y) the Administrative Agent shall have consented to all such Commitment termination(s) (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, but may include consideration of the adequacy of the Companys liquidity) and (z) each Demanding Lender has been paid all amounts then due to it under this Agreement and each other Loan Document (which, for the avoidance of doubt, the respective Borrowers may pay in connection with any such termination without making ratable payments to any other Lender (other than another Demanding Lender)).  In no event shall the termination of a Demanding Lenders Commitments in accordance with this paragraph impair or otherwise affect the obligation of the Company to make the payments demanded by such Demanding Lender in accordance with Section 8.1(a) and/or Section 8.1(b).
 
(c)                                  The Administrative Agent agrees to promptly notify the Company upon any Lender becoming a Defaulting Lender (but the Administrative Agent shall have no liability for any failure to give, or any delay in giving, any such notice).
 
8.8                               Conclusiveness of Statements; Survival of Provisions.  Determinations and statements of any Lender pursuant to Section 8.1, 8.2, 8.3 or 8.4 shall be conclusive absent demonstrable error.  Lenders may use reasonable averaging and attribution methods in determining compensation under Sections 8.1 and 8.4, and the provisions of such Sections shall survive repayment of the Loans, cancellation of the Notes, cancellation or expiration of the Letters of Credit and any termination of this Agreement.
 
SECTION 9.                            REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.

ured Designated Debt of Subsidiaries, including Securitization Obligations, and (d) Designated Debt of Subsidiaries as to which the providers of such Designated Debt (and beneficiaries of any related Suretyship Liability) are parties to the Intercreditor Agreement.

87





 
(b)                                 shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents), provided that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law, including for the avoidance of doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law; and
 
(c)                                  shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Company or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.
 
The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Sections 12.2 and 14.1) or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct.  The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Event of Default or Unmatured Event of Default unless and until notice describing such Event of Default or Unmatured Event of Default is given to the Administrative Agent by the Company, a Lender or an Issuing Lender.
 
The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Event of Default or Unmatured Event of Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or the creation, perfection or priority of any Lien purported to be created by the Loan Documents, (v) the value or the sufficiency of any collateral granted under the Loan Documents, or (vi) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Section 11 or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.

88





 
making of a Loan, or the issuance of a Letter of Credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or an Issuing Lender, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender or such Issuing Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender or such Issuing Lender prior to the making of such Loan or the issuance of such Letter of Credit.  The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Company), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
 
(b)                                 For purposes of determining compliance with the conditions specified in Section 11.1, each Lender that has executed this Agreement shall be deemed to have consented to, approved or accepted or to be satisfied with, each document or other matter either sent by the Administrative Agent to such Lender for consent, approval, acceptance or satisfaction, or required thereunder to be consented to or approved by or acceptable or satisfactory to a Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from such Lender prior to the proposed Closing Date specifying its objection thereto.
 
13.5                        Credit Decision.  Each Lender and each Issuing Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement.  Each Lender and each Issuing Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.
 
13.6                        Indemnification.  Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, the Lenders shall indemnify upon demand the Agent-Related Persons (to the extent not reimbursed by or on behalf of the Company or any other Loan Party as required by any Loan Document and without limiting the obligation of the Company or any other Loan Party to do so), pro rata, from and against any and all Indemnified Liabilities to the extent that any such unreimbursed Indemnified Liabilities were incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent in its capacity as such, or against any other Agent-Related Person acting for the Administrative Agent in connection with such capacity; provided that (a) no Lender shall be liable for any payment to any Agent-Related Person of any portion of the Indemnified Liabilities to the extent determined in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such Persons gross negligence or willful misconduct and (b) no action taken in accordance with the directions of the Required Lenders shall be deemed to constitute gross negligence of willful misconduct for purposes of this Section.  Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender shall reimburse the Administrative Agent upon demand for its ratable share of any costs or out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees of attorneys for the Administrative Agent) incurred by the Administrative Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any document contemplated by or referred to herein, to the extent that the Administrative Agent is not
 
89





 
reimbursed for such expenses by or on behalf of the Company.  The undertaking in this Section shall survive repayment of the Loans, cancellation of the Notes, cancellation or expiration of the Letters of Credit and the Commitments, any termination of this Agreement and the resignation of the Administrative Agent.
 
13.7                        Administrative Agent in Individual Capacity.  JPMorgan and its Affiliates may make loans to, issue letters of credit for the account of, accept deposits from, acquire equity interests in and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust, financial advisory, underwriting or other business with the Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates as though JPMorgan were not the Administrative Agent, an Issuing Lender and a Swing Line Lender hereunder, and without notice to or consent of the Lenders.  The Lenders acknowledge that, pursuant to such activities, JPMorgan or its Affiliates may receive information regarding the Company or its Subsidiaries (including information that may be subject to confidentiality obligations in favor of the Company or such Subsidiary) and acknowledge that the Administrative Agent shall not be under any obligation to provide such information to them.  With respect to its Loans, JPMorgan and its Affiliates shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any other Lender and may exercise such rights and powers as though it were not the Administrative Agent, an Issuing Lender or a Swing Line Lender.
 
13.8                        Resignation of Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders, the Issuing Lenders and the Company.  Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, with the consent of the Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), to appoint a successor, which shall be a bank with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States.  If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and consented to by the Company (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above; provided that if the Administrative Agent shall notify the Company and the Lenders that no qualifying Person has accepted such appointment, then such resignation shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice and (a) the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (except that in the case of any collateral security held by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders or the Issuing Lenders under any of the Loan Documents, the retiring Administrative Agent shall continue to hold such collateral security until such time as a successor Administrative Agent is appointed) and (b) all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender and each Issuing Lender directly, until such time as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided for above in this Section.  Upon the acceptance of a successors appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or retired) Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this Section).  The fees payable by the Company to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the
 
90





 
Company and such successor.  After the retiring Administrative Agents resignation hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Section 13 and Sections 14.6 and 14.12 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring Administrative Agent was acting as Administrative Agent.

13.9                        Guaranty Matters.  The Administrative Agent shall, and the Lenders irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent to, upon the written request of the Company, release any Subsidiary Guarantor from its obligations under the Subsidiary Guaranty if, after giving effect to such release, the Company is in compliance with Sections 10.11 and 10.16.  Upon request by the Administrative Agent at any time, the Lenders will confirm in writing the Administrative Agents authority to release any Subsidiary Guarantor from its obligations under the Subsidiary Guaranty pursuant to this Section 13.9.  In addition to the foregoing, any Subsidiary Guarantor that ceases to be a Subsidiary as a result of a transaction permitted by this Agreement shall be automatically released from the Subsidiary Guaranty upon the consummation of such transaction.
 
13.10                 Administrative Agent May File Proofs of Claim.  In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding relative to the Company or any other Loan Party, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan, reimbursement obligation or other obligation shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the Company) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise
 
(a)                                 to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans, reimbursement obligations in respect of Letters of Credit and all other obligations of the Company and the other Loan Parties under the Loan Documents that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders and the Administrative Agent under Sections 5 and 14.6) allowed in such judicial proceeding; and
 
91





 
(b)                                 to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;

95





 
assigning Lender under such Sections (and if any assignment is made in violation of the foregoing, the Company will not be required to pay the incremental amounts) and (b) the Company and the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with the interests so assigned and delegated to an Assignee until the date when all of the following conditions shall have been met:
 
(x)     five Business Days (or such lesser period of time as the Administrative Agent and the assigning Lender shall agree) shall have passed after written notice of such assignment and delegation, together with payment instructions, addresses and related information with respect to such Assignee, shall have been given to the Company and the Administrative Agent by such assigning Lender and the Assignee,
 
(y)     the assigning Lender and the Assignee shall have executed and delivered to the Company and the Administrative Agent an assignment agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit D (an Assignment Agreement), together with any documents required to be delivered hereunder, which Assignment Agreement shall have been accepted by the Administrative Agent, and
 
(z)     the assigning Lender or the Assignee shall have paid the Administrative Agent a processing fee of $3,500.
 
From and after the date on which the conditions described above have been met, (x) such Assignee shall be deemed automatically to have become a party hereto and, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned and delegated to such Assignee pursuant to such Assignment Agreement, shall have the rights and obligations of a Lender hereunder, and (y) the assigning Lender, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned and delegated by it pursuant to such Assignment Agreement, shall be released from its obligations hereunder; provided that, except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no assignment by a Defaulting Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from such Lenders having been a Defaulting Lender.  Any attempted assignment and delegation not made in accordance with this Section 14.8.1 shall be null and void.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 14.8.1 or any other provision of this Agreement, (a) no assignment shall be made to (i) the Company or any Affiliate or Subsidiary thereof, (ii) any Defaulting Lender or any Subsidiary thereof, or any Person which, upon becoming a Lender hereunder, would constitute any of the foregoing Persons described in this clause (ii) or (iii) a natural Person, and (b) any Lender may at any time assign all or any portion of its Loans and its Note to a Federal Reserve Bank (but no such assignment shall release any Lender from any of its obligations hereunder).
 
In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments to the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with the
 
96





 
consent of the Company and the Administrative Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Loans previously requested but not funded by such Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Lender, each Swing Line Lender and each other Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon), and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro rata share of all Loans and participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans in accordance with its Percentage.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under applicable law without compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs.
 
The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Company and the Borrowers, shall maintain a copy of each Assignment Agreement delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts (and stated interest) of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the Register).  The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Company, the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement.  The Register shall be available for inspection by the Company and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
 
14.8.2         Participations.  Any Lender may at any time sell to one or more commercial banks or other Persons (other than (i) the Company or any Affiliate or Subsidiary thereof, (ii) any Defaulting Lender or any Subsidiary thereof, or any Person which, if it became a Lender hereunder, would constitute any of the foregoing Persons described in this clause (ii) or (iii) a natural Person) participating interests in any Loan owing to such Lender, the Note held by such Lender, the Commitment of such Lender, the direct or participation interest of such Lender in any Letter of Credit or Swing Line Loan or any other interest of such Lender hereunder (any Person purchasing any such participating interest being herein called a Participant).  In the event of a sale by a Lender of a participating interest to a Participant, (x) such Lender shall remain the holder of its Note for all purposes of this Agreement, (y) the Company and the Administrative Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lenders rights and obligations hereunder and (z) all amounts payable by the Company shall be determined as if such Lender had not sold such participation and shall be paid directly to such Lender.  No Participant shall have any direct or indirect voting rights hereunder except with respect to any of the events described in the third sentence of Section 14.1.  Each Lender agrees to incorporate the requirements of the preceding sentence into each participation agreement which such Lender enters into with any Participant.  The Company agrees that if amounts outstanding under this Agreement and the Notes are due and payable (as a result of acceleration or otherwise), each Participant shall be deemed to have the right of setoff in respect of its participating interest in amounts owing under this Agreement to the same extent as if the amount of its participating interest were owing directly to it as a Lende

stated interest) of each Participants interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the Participant Register); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participants interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations.  The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.
 
14.9        Payments Set Aside.  To the extent that any payment by or on behalf of the Company is made to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, or the Administrative Agent or any Lender exercises its right of set-off, and such payment or the proceeds of such set-off or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Administrative Agent or such Lender in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in connection with any proceeding under any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law or otherwise, then to the extent of such recovery, the obligation or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such set-off had not occurred, and each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent upon demand its applicable share of any amount so recovered from or repaid by the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such payment is made at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect.
 
14.10      Governing Law; Severability.  This Agreement and any claims, controversy, dispute or cause of action (whether in contract or tort or otherwise) based upon, arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the law of the State of New York.
 
Whenever possible each provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision of this Agreement shall be prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of this Agreement.  All obligations of the Borrowers and rights of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders expressed herein or in any other Loan Document shall be in addition to and not in limitation of those provided by applicable law.

 connection herewith or therewith (whether before or after the Closing Date).  All amounts due under this Section 14.11 shall be payable within ten Business Days after demand therefor (which demand shall be accompanied by a statement from the applicable Lender Party setting forth such amounts in reasonable detail).  All obligations provided for in this Section 14.11 shall survive repayment of the Loans, cancellation of the Notes, cancellation or expiration of the Letters of Credit and any termination of this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 14.11 shall not apply with respect to Taxes other than any Taxes that represent losses, claims, damages, etc. arising from any non-Tax claim.
 
14.12      Forum Selection and Consent to Jurisdiction.  (a) The Company irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that it will not commence any action, litigation or proceeding of any kind or description, whether in law or equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Administrative Agent, any Lender, any Issuing Lender or any Related Party of any of the foregoing in any way relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the transactions relating hereto or thereto, in any forum other than the courts of the State of New York sitting in New York County and of the United States District Court of the Southern District of New York, and any appellate court from any thereof, and each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the jurisdiction of such courts and agrees that all claims in respect of any action, litigation or proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York State court or, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in such Federal court.  Each party hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action, litigation or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.  Nothing in this Agreement shall affect any right that the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Lender may otherwise have to bring any action, litigation or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any Borrower or any of its properties in the courts of any jurisdiction.
 
(b)           Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document in any court referred to in paragraph (a) of this Section.  Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.

accordance with normal banking procedures the Administrative Agent could purchase the first currency with such other currency on the Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is given.  The obligation of each Borrower in respect of any such sum due from it to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder or under the other Loan Documents shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency (the Judgment Currency) other than that in which such sum is denominated in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement (the Agreement Currency), be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by the Administrative Agent or such Lender of any sum adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency, the Administrative Agent or such Lender may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase the Agreement Currency with the Judgment Currency.  If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the Agreement Currency, each Borrower agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the Administrative Agent or such Lender or the Person to whom such obligation was owing against such loss.  If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is greater than the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in such currency, the Administrative Agent or such Lender agrees to return the amount of any excess to such Borrower (or to any other Person who may be entitled thereto under applicable law).
 
14.18      Most Favored Lender.  If at any time (a)(i) the Company enters into any credit agreement, loan agreement, note purchase agreement or other like agreement under which the Company may incur Designated Debt in excess of $50,000,000, including the Note Purchase Agreements and the Senior Notes (a Principal Lending Agreement), and (ii) any such Principal Lending Agreement at any time includes a covenant that expressly limits either: (x) the sale, lease or disposition of assets by the Company and/or any Subsidiary during any period of 12 consecutive months to less than 15% of the book value of consolidated tangible assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, or (y) the incurrence of Designated Debt by any Foreign Subsidiary, in either case that is not contained in this Agreement, or if such covenant that is contained in the Principal Lending Agreement is more favorable to such creditors of the Company than a similar covenant contained in this Agreement, or (b) the Company issues an additional series of Senior Notes pursuant to any Supplement (as defined in the applicable Note Purchase Agreement) or amends any existing series of Senior Notes, in each case, that has an additional covenant (within the meaning of Section 2.2(iii) of the applicable Note Purchase Agreement), the Company shall give written notice thereof to the Administrative Agent not later than 10 days following the date of execution of such Principal Lending Agreement or amendment thereof or Supplement, as the case may be (each a Subject Agreement); provided that any such additional covenant shall not impair, diminish or otherwise adversely modify any existing covenants contained herein.  Effective on the date of execution of a Subject Agreement, such covenant (or covenants) and related definitions that are contained in such Subject Agreement (collectively, the Incorporated Covenants) shall be deemed to have been incorporated herein and any event of default in respect of any such Incorporated Covenant shall be deemed to be an Event of Default hereunder, subject to all applicable terms and provisions of this Agreement, including the right of the Required Lenders to waive or not waive any breach thereof (independent of any right of any other creditor of the Company in respect of any such Incorporated Covenants).  Without limiting the foregoing, any amendmen

ncorporated Covenant hereunder.
 
SECTION 15.                     COMPANY GUARANTY.
 
15.1                        The Guaranty.  In order to induce the Lenders to enter into this Agreement and to extend credit hereunder and in recognition of the direct benefits to be received by the Company from the proceeds of the Loans and the issuance of the Letters of Credit, the Company hereby agrees with the Lenders as follows: the Company hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees as primary obligor and not merely as surety the full and prompt payment when due, whether upon maturity, acceleration or otherwise, of any and all of the Guaranteed Obligations (other than, with respect to the Company, any Excluded Swap Obligations of the Company) of the Subsidiary Borrowers to the Guaranteed Creditors.  If any or all of the Guaranteed Obligations of such Borrowers to the Guaranteed Creditors becomes due and payable hereunder, the Company unconditionally promises to pay such indebtedness to the Administrative Agent and/or the Lenders, on demand, together with any and all reasonable, out-of-pocket expenses which may be incurred by the Administrative Agent or the Lenders in collecting any of the Guaranteed Obligations.  If claim is ever made upon any Guaranteed Creditor for repayment or recovery of any amount or amounts received in payment or on account of any of the Guaranteed Obligations and any of the aforesaid payees repays all or part of said amount by reason of (i) any judgment, decree or order of any court or administrative body having jurisdiction over such payee or any of its property or (ii) any settlement or compromise of any such claim effected by such payee with any such claimant (including the Borrowers), then and in such event the Company agrees that any such judgment, decree, order, settlement or compromise shall be binding upon the Company, notwithstanding any revocation of the guaranty under this Section 15 or other instrument evidencing any liability of any Borrower, and the Company shall be and remain liable to the aforesaid payees hereunder for the amount so repaid or recovered to the same extent as if such amount h

to the payment of any liability (whether due or not) of any Borrower to its creditors other than the Guaranteed Creditors;
 
(f)                                   apply any sums by whomsoever paid or howsoever realized to any liability or liabilities of any Borrower to the Guaranteed Creditors regardless of what liability or liabilities of the Company or any Borrower remain unpaid;
 
105





 
(g)                                  consent to or waive any breach of, or any act, omission or default under, this Agreement or any of the instruments or agreements referred to herein, or otherwise amend, modify or supplement this Agreement or any of such other instruments or agreements; and/or
 
(h)                                 take any other action which would, under otherwise applicable principles of common law, give rise to a legal or equitable discharge of the Company from its liabilities under this Section 15;
 
it being understood that the foregoing shall not permit any action by the Administrative Agent or any Lender that is not otherwise permitted by this Agreement or any other Loan Document.
 
15.6                        Reliance.  It is not necessary for any Guaranteed Creditor to inquire into the capacity or powers of any Borrower or the officers, directors, partners or agents acting or purporting to act on their behalf, and any Guaranteed Obligations made or created in reliance upon the professed exercise of such powers shall be guaranteed hereunder.
 
15.7                        Subordination.  Any of the indebtedness of each Borrower relating to the Guaranteed Obligations now or hereafter owing to the Company is hereby subordinated to the Guaranteed Obligations of such Borrower owing to the Guaranteed Creditors, and if the Administrative Agent so requests at a time when an Event of Default exists, all such indebtedness relating to the Guaranteed Obligations of such Borrower to the Company shall be collected, enforced and received by the Company for the benefit of the Guaranteed Creditors and be paid over to the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Guaranteed Creditors on account of the Guaranteed Obligations of such Borrower to the Guaranteed Creditors, but without affecting or impairing in any manner the liability of the Company under the other provisions of this Section 15.  Prior to the transfer by the Company of any note or negotiable instrument evidencing any of the indebtedness relating to the Guaranteed Obligations of such Borrower to the Company, the Company shall mark such note or negotiable instrument with a legend that the same is subject to this subordination.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company hereby agrees with the Guaranteed Creditors that it will not exercise any right of subrogation which it may at any time otherwise have as a result of the guaranty under this Section 15 (whether contractual, under Section 509 of the United States Bankruptcy Code or otherwise) until all Guaranteed Obligations have been irrevocably paid in full in cash.
 
15.8                        W

y waives any right (except as shall be required by applicable statute and cannot be waived) to require any Guaranteed Creditor to (i) proceed against any Borrower, any other guarantor or any other party, (ii) proceed against or exhaust any security held from any Borrower, any other guarantor or any other party or (iii) pursue any other remedy in any Guaranteed Creditors power whatsoever.  The Company waives any defense based on or arising out of any defense of any Borrower, any other guarantor or any other party, other than payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations, based on or arising out of the disability of any Borrower, any other guarantor or any other party, or the validity, legality or unenforceability of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the liability of any Borrower other than payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations.  The Guaranteed Creditors may, at their election, foreclose on any security held by the Administrative
 
106





 
Agent or any other Guaranteed Creditor by one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, whether or not every aspect of any such sale is commercially reasonable (to the extent such sale is permitted by applicable law), or exercise any other right or remedy the Guaranteed Creditors may have against any Borrower or any other party, or any security, without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of the Company hereunder except to the extent the Guaranteed Obligations have been paid.  The Company waives any defense arising out of any such election by the Guaranteed Creditors, even though such election operates to impair or extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of the Company against any Borrower or any other party or any security.
 
(b)                                 Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, the Company waives all presentments, demands for performance, protests and notices, including notices of nonperformance, notices of protest, notices of dishonor, notices of acceptance of the guaranty hereunder, and notices of the existence, creation or incurring of new or additional Guaranteed Obligations.  The Company assumes all responsibility for being and keeping itself informed of each Borrowers financial condition and assets, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Guaranteed Obligations and the nature, scope and extent of the risks which the Company assumes and incurs hereunder, and agrees that the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall have no duty to advise the Company of information known to them regarding such circumstances or risks.
 
15.9                        Nature of Liability.  It is the desire and intent of the Company and the Guaranteed Creditors that this Section 15 shall be enforced against the Company to the fullest extent permissible under the laws and public policies applied in each jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought.  If, however, and to the extent that, the obligations of the Company under this Section 15 shall be adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason (including because of any applicable state or federal law relating to fraudulent conveyances or transfers), then the amount of the Guaranteed Obligations shall be deemed to be reduced and the Company shall pay the maximum amount of the Guaranteed Obligations which would be permissible under applicable law.
