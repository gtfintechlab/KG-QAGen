      contemplated hereby and thereby including, without limitation, (a) any and all claims for brokerage, leasing, finders or similar fees which may be made relating to the Borrowing Base Properties, any other Real Estate or the Loans, (b) any condition

      under this §16 to indemnify any Person for liabilities arising from such Person’s own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction after the exhaustion of all applicable appeal periods. In litigation, or
      the preparation therefor, the Lenders and the Agent shall be entitled to select a single law firm as their own counsel and an additional single local counsel in each applicable local jurisdiction for all such parties (and, to the extent reasonably
      necessary in the case of an actual or perceived conflict of interest, one additional counsel) and, in addition to the foregoing indemnity, the Borrower agrees to pay promptly the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel. No person indemnified
      hereunder shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by unintended recipients of any information or other materials distributed by it through telecommunications, electronic or other information transmission systems in connection with this
      Agreement or the other Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. If, and to the extent that the obligations of the Borrower under this §16 are unenforceable for any reason, the Borrower hereby agrees to make the maximum
      contribution to the payment in satisfaction of such obligations which is permissible under Applicable Law. The provisions of this §16 shall survive the repayment of the Loans and the termination of the obligations of the Lenders hereunder.</font></p>

      Commitment and the same portion of the Loans at the time owing to it and the Notes held by it); <u>provided</u> that (a) the Agent, the Issuing Lender and, so long as no Default or Event of Default exists hereunder, the Borrower shall have each
      given its prior written consent to such assignment, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and if the Borrower does not respond to any such request for consent within ten (10) Business Days, the Borrower shall be deemed to have
      consented (provided that such consent shall not be required for any assignment to another Lender, to a Related Fund, to a lender or an Affiliate of a Lender which controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the assigning Lender or to a
      wholly-owned Subsidiary of such Lender), (b) each such assignment shall be of a constant, and not a varying, percentage of all the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Revolving Credit Commitment in the

      in the Term Loans is assigned, and if such Lender holds both a Revolving Credit Commitment and a Term Loan Commitment, such Lender shall assign an equal percentage of its Revolving Credit Commitment and Term Loan Commitment, (c) the parties to such
      assignment shall execute and deliver to the Agent, for recording in the Register (as hereinafter defined) an assignment and acceptance agreement in the form of <u>Exhibit I</u> attached hereto (an “<u>Assignment and Acceptance Agreement</u>”),
      together with any Notes subject to such assignment, (d) in no event shall any assignment be to any Person controlling, controlled by or under common control with, or which is not otherwise free from influence or control by the Borrower or any
      Guarantor or be to a Defaulting Lender or an Affiliate of a Defaulting Lender, (e) such assignee of a portion of the Revolving Credit Loans shall have a net worth or unfunded commitment as of the date of such assignment of not less than
      $100,000,000.00 (unless otherwise approved by the Agent and, so long as no Default or Event of Default exists hereunder, the Borrower), (f) such assignee shall acquire an interest in the Loans of not less than $5,000,000.00 and integral multiples of
      $1,000,000.00 in excess thereof (or if less, the remaining Loans of the assignor), unless waived by the Agent, and so long as no Default or Event of Default exists hereunder, the Borrower and (g) if such assignment is less than the assigning Lender’s
      entire Commitment, the assigning Lender shall retain an interest in the Loans of not less than $5,000,000.00. Upon execution, delivery, acceptance and recording of such Assignment and Acceptance Agreement, (i) the assignee thereunder shall be a party
      hereto and all other Loan Documents executed by the Lenders and, to the extent provided in such Assignment and Acceptance Agreement, have the rights and obligations of a Lender hereunder, (ii) the assigning Lender shall, upon payment to the Agent of
      the registration fee referred to in §18.2, be released from its obligations under this Agreement arising after the effective date of such assignment with respect to the assigned portion of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement,
      and (iii) the Agent may unilaterally amend <u>Schedule 1.1</u> to reflect such assignment. In connection with each assignment, the assignee shall represent and warrant to the Agent, the assignor and each other Lender as to whether such assignee is
      controlling, controlled by, under common control with or is not otherwise free from influence or control by, the Borrower and/or any Guarantor and whether such assignee is a Defaulting Lender or an Affiliate of a Defaulting Lender. In connection with
      any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments
      to the Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or actions, including funding, with the consent of the Borrower and the Agent, the
      applicable pro rata share of Loans previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by
      such Defaulting Lender to the Agent or any Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon) and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro rata share of all Loans and participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Loans in accordance with its
      applicable Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under Applicable Law without compliance with the
      provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs.</font></p>

      that certain amendments, modifications or waivers be made to this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents which request requires approval of the Required Lenders, the Required Revolving Credit Lenders, the Required Term Loan Lenders, all of the
      Lenders or all of the Lenders directly affected thereby but is not approved by one or more of the Lenders (any such non-consenting Lender shall hereafter be referred to as the “<u>Non-Consenting Lender</u>”), then, within thirty (30) Business Days
      after the Borrower’s receipt of notice of such disapproval by such Non-Consenting Lender, the Borrower shall have the right as to such Non-Consenting Lender, to be exercised by delivery of written notice delivered to the Agent and the Non-Consenting
      Lender within thirty (30) Business Days of receipt of such notice, to elect to cause the Non-Consenting Lender to transfer its Commitment. The Agent shall promptly notify the remaining Lenders that each of such Lenders shall have the right, but not
      the obligation, to acquire a portion of the Commitment, pro rata based upon their relevant Commitment Percentages, of the Non-Consenting Lender (or if any of such Lenders does not elect to purchase its pro rata share, then to such remaining Lenders
      in such proportion as approved by the Agent). In the event that the Lenders do not elect to acquire all of the Non-Consenting Lender’s Commitment, then the Agent shall endeavor to find a new Lender or Lenders to acquire such remaining Commitment.
      Upon any such purchase of the Commitment of the Non-Consenting Lender, the Non-Consenting Lender’s interests in the Obligations and its rights hereunder and under the Loan Documents shall terminate at the date of purchase, and the Non-Consenting
      Lender shall promptly execute and deliver any and all documents reasonably requested by the Agent to surrender and transfer such interest, including, without limitation, an Assignment and Acceptance Agreement and such Non-Consenting Lender’s original
      Note. Notwithstanding anything in this §18.8 to the contrary, any Lender or other Lender assignee acquiring some or all of the assigned Commitment of the Non-Consenting Lender must consent to the proposed amendment, modification or waiver. The
      purchase price for the Non-Consenting Lender’s Commitment shall equal any and all amounts outstanding and owed by the Borrower to the Non-Consenting Lender, including principal and all accrued and unpaid interest or fees, plus any applicable amounts
      payable pursuant to §4.7 which would be owed to such Non-Consenting Lender if the Loans were to be repaid in full on the date of such purchase of the Non-Consenting Lender’s Commitment (<u>provided</u> that the Borrower may pay to such Non-Consenting
      Lender any interest, fees or other amounts (other than principal) owing to such Non-Consenting Lender).</font></p>
