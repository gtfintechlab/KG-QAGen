Swing Line Loans shall be made, if at all, only in the sole and absolute discretion of the Swing Line Lender, and in any event shall not be made if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender.(b)    Borrowing Notice.  In order to borrow a Swing Line Loan, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent and the Swing Line Lender irrevocable notice (a “Swing Line Borrowing Notice”) not later than 1:00 p.m. (local time in Denver, Colorado) on the Borrowing Date of each Swing Line Loan, specifying (i) the applicable Borrowing Date (which date shall be a Business Day), and (ii) the aggregate amount of the requested Swing Line Loan which shall be an amount not less than $100,000.(c)    Making of Swing Line Loans; Participations.

The Administrative Agent will promptly make the funds so received from the Swing Line Lender available to the Borrower on the Borrowing Date at the Administrative Agent’s aforesaid address.  Each time that a Swing Line Loan is made by the Swing Line Lender, the Swing Line Lender shall be deemed, without further action by any party hereto, to have unconditionally and irrevocably sold to each Lender and each Lender shall be deemed, without further action by any party hereto, to have unconditionally and irrevocably purchased from the Swing Line Lender, a participation in such Swing Line Loan in proportion to its Pro Rata Share.(d)    Repayment of Swing Line Loans.  Each Swing Line Loan shall be paid in full by the Borrower on the date selected by the Administrative Agent.  In addition, the Swing Line Lender may at any time in its sole discretion with respect to any outstanding Swing Line Loan, require each Lender to fund the participation acquired by such Lender pursuant to Section 2.4(c) or require each Lender (including the Swing Line Lender) to make a Revolving Loan in the amount of such Lender’s Pro Rata Share of such Swing Line Loan (including, without limitation, any interest accrued and unpaid thereon), for the purpose of repaying such Swing Line Loan.  Not later than 2:00 p.m. (local time in Denver, Colorado) on the date of any notice received pursuant to this Section 2.4(d), each Lender shall make available its required Revolving Loan, in funds immediately available to the Administrative Agent at its address specified pursuant to Article XIII.

Unless a Lender shall have notified the Swing Line Lender, prior to the Swing Line Lender’s making any Swing Line Loan, that any applicable condition precedent set forth in Sections 4.1 or 4.2 had not then been satisfied, such Lender’s obligation to make Revolving Loans pursuant to this Section 2.4(d) to repay Swing Line Loans or to fund the participation acquired pursuant to Section 2.4(c) shall be unconditional, continuing, irrevocable and absolute and shall not be affected by any circumstances, including, without limitation, (a) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Swing Line Lender or any other Person, (b) the occurrence or continuance of a Default or Event of Default, (c) any adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise) of the Borrower, or (d) any other circumstances, happening or event whatsoever.  In the event that any Lender fails to make payment to the Administrative Agent of any amount due under this Section 2.4(d), interest shall accrue thereon at the Federal Funds Effective Rate for each day during the period commencing on the date of demand and ending on the date such amount is received and the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to receive, retain and apply against such obligation the principal and interest otherwise payable to such Lender hereunder until the Administrative Agent receives such payment from such Lender or such obligation is otherwise fully satisfied.  For the avoidance of doubt, no 364-Day Revolving Loan Lender shall have any obligations under this Section 2.4(d).  On the Five-Year Revolving Loan Termination Date, the Borrower shall repay in full the outstanding principal balance of the Swing Line Loans.2.5.    Commitment Fees.  The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of (a) each Five-Year Revolving Lender according to its Five-Year Revolving Pro Rata Share a commitment fee at the per annum rate specified therefor in the definition of Applicable Margin on the average daily Available Aggregate Five-Year Revolving Commitment from the date hereof to and including the Five-Year Revolving Loan Termination Date, payable in arrears on each Payment Date hereafter and on the Five-Year Revolving Loan Termination Date and (b) each 364-Day Revolving Lender according to its 364-Day Revolving Pro Rata Share a commitment fee at the per annum rate specified therefor in the definition of Applicable Margin on the average daily Available Aggregate 364-Day Revolving Commitment from the date hereof to and including the 364-Day Revolving Loan Termination Date, payable in arrears on each Payment Date hereafter and on the 364-Day Revolving Loan Termination Date; provided, that commitment fees shall only accrue in respect of the 364-Day Revolving Commitments during a 364-Day Revolving Facility Availability Period.  Swing Line Loans shall not count as usage of the Five-Year Revolving Commitment for the purpose of calculating the commitment fee due hereunder.2.6.    Minimum Amount of Each Revolving Advance.  Each Eurodollar Revolving Advance shall be in the minimum amount of $1,000,000 and incremental amounts in integral multiples of $1,000,000, and each Base Rate Revolving Advance (other than an Advance to repay Swing Line Loans) shall be in the minimum amount of $1,000,000 and incremental amounts in integral multiples of $1,000,000, provided, however, that any Base Rate Revolving Advance may be in the amount of the Available Aggregate Five-Year Revolving Commitment or the Available Aggregate 364-Day Revolving Commitment.2.7.    Reductions in Aggregate Commitment; Optional Principal Payments.  (a)    The Borrower may permanently reduce the aggregate 364-Day Revolving Commitment and/or the aggregate Five-Year Revolving Commitment in whole, or in part ratably among the Revolving Lenders of such Class in integral multiples of $1,000,000, upon at least five (5) Business Days’ prior written notice to the Administrative Agent by 12:00 noon (local time in Denver, Colorado)) in the form of Exhibit C-3 (a “Payment Notice”), which notice shall specify the amount of any such reduction, provided, however, that the amount of (x) the aggregate 364-Day Revolving Commitments of the 364-Day Revolving Lenders may not be reduced below the aggregate 364-Day Revolving Exposure and (y) the aggregate Five-Year Revolving Commitments of the Five-Year Revolving Lenders may not be reduced below the aggregate Five-Year Revolving Exposure.  All accrued commitment fees shall be payable on the effective date of any termination of the obligations of the Lenders to make Credit Extensions hereunder.  (b)    The Borrower may from time to time pay, without penalty or premium, all outstanding Base Rate Advances (other than Swing Line Loans), or, in a minimum aggregate amount of $1,000,000 and incremental amounts in integral multiples of $1,000,000 (or the aggregate amount of the outstanding Revolving Loans at such time), any portion of the aggregate outstanding Base Rate Advances (other than Swing Line Loans) upon same day notice by 12:00 noon (local time in Denver, Colorado) to the Administrative Agent.

The Borrower may from time to time pay, subject to the payment of any funding indemnification amounts required by Section 3.4 but without penalty or premium, all outstanding Eurodollar Advances, or, in a minimum aggregate amount of $1,000,000 and incremental amounts in integral multiples of $1,000,000 (or the aggregate amount of the outstanding Revolving Loans at such time), any portion of the aggregate outstanding Eurodollar Advances upon at least two (2) Business Days’ prior written notice to the Administrative Agent by 12:00 noon (local time in Denver, Colorado).  All voluntary prepayments of Term Loans pursuant to this Section 2.7 shall be applied ratably to all then outstanding Term Loans and to scheduled principal installments in inverse order of maturity.2.8.    Method of Selecting Types and Interest Periods for New Revolving Advances.  The Borrower shall select the Type of Advance and, in the case of each Eurodollar Advance and the Interest Period.  For Revolving Loans, the Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent irrevocable notice in the form of Exhibit C-1 (a “Borrowing Notice”) not later than 10:00 am (local time in Denver, Colorado) on the Borrowing Date of each Base Rate Revolving Advance (other than a Swing Line Loan), two (2) Business Days before the Borrowing Date for each Eurodollar Revolving Advance in Dollars, specifying:(i)the Borrowing Date, which shall be a Business Day, of such Advance,(ii)the aggregate amount of such Advance,(iii)the Type of Advance selected,  and(iv)in the case of each Eurodollar Advance, the Interest Period applicable thereto.Not later than 12:00 noon (local time in Denver, Colorado) on each Borrowing Date, each Lender shall make available its Loan or Loans in funds immediately available to the Administrative Agent at its address specified pursuant to Article XIII.

Each Eurodollar Advance denominated in Dollars shall continue as a Eurodollar Advance until the end of the then applicable Interest Period therefor, at which time such Eurodollar Advance shall be automatically converted into a Base Rate Advance unless (x) such Eurodollar Advance is or was repaid in accordance with Section 2.7 or (y) the Borrower shall have given the Administrative Agent a Conversion/Continuation Notice (as defined below) requesting that, at the end of such Interest Period, such Eurodollar Advance continue as a Eurodollar Advance for the same or another Interest Period.  Subject to the terms of Section 2.6, the Borrower may elect from time to time to convert all or any part of a Base Rate Advance (other than a Swing Line Loan) into a Eurodollar Advance.  The Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent irrevocable notice in the form of Exhibit C-2 (a “Conversion/Continuation Notice”) of each conversion of a Base Rate Advance into a Eurodollar Advance, conversion of a Eurodollar Advance to a Base Rate Advance, or continuation of a Eurodollar Advance not later than 10:00 a.m. (local time in Denver, Colorado) at least two (2) Business Days prior to the date of the requested conversion or continuation, specifying:(i)the requested date, which shall be a Business Day, of such conversion or continuation,(ii)the Type of the Advance which is to be converted or continued, and(iii)the amount of such Advance which is to be converted into or continued as a Eurodollar Advance and the duration of the Interest Period applicable thereto.After giving effect to all Advances, all conversions of Advances from one Type to another and all continuations of Advances of the same Type, there shall be no more than twenty (20) Interest Periods in effect hereunder; provided, that with respect to seven (7) day Interest Periods, no more than five of such Interest Periods shall be in effect at any time.Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any Lender may exchange, continue or roll over all or a portion of its Loans in connection with any refinancing, extension, loan modification or similar transaction permitted by the terms of this Agreement, pursuant to a cashless settlement mechanism approved by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and such Lender.2.10.    Interest Rates.  Each Base Rate Advance (other than a Swing Line Loan) shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof, for each day from and including the date such Advance is made or is automatically converted from a Eurodollar Advance into a Base Rate Advance pursuant to Section 2.9, to but excluding the date it becomes due or is converted into a Eurodollar Advance pursuant to Section 2.9 hereof, at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate for such day; provided, that if a Base Rate Advance is due as a result of an Event of Default or is otherwise outstanding during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Base Rate shall continue to apply thereto plus such other amounts as required under Section 2.11.  Each Swing Line Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof, for each day from and including the day such Swing Line Loan is made to but excluding the date it is paid, at a rate per annum equal to, at the Borrower’s option, the Base Rate for such day or the Daily Eurodollar Rate.  Changes in the rate of interest on that portion of any Advance maintained as a Base Rate Advance will take effect simultaneously with each change in the Alternate Base Rate.  Each Eurodollar Advance shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from and including the first day of the Interest Period applicable thereto to (but not including) the last day of such Interest Period at the interest rate determined by the Administrative Agent as applicable to such Eurodollar Advance based upon the Borrower’s selections under Sections 2.8 and 2.9 and the Applicable Margin.  No Interest Period may end after the 364-Day Revolving Loan Termination Date, the Five-Year Revolving Loan Termination Date, the Five-Year Term Loan Maturity Date or the Seven-Year Term Loan Maturity Date, as applicable.2.11.    Rates Applicable After Event of Default.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Sections 2.8, 2.9 or 2.10, during the continuance of a Default or Event of Default the Required Lenders may, at their option, by notice from the Administrative Agent to the Borrower (which notice may be revoked at the option of the Required Lenders notwithstanding any provision of Section 8.3 requiring unanimous consent of the Lenders to changes in interest rates), declare that no Advance may be made as, converted into or continued as a Eurodollar Advance.  During the continuance of an Event of Default the Required Lenders may, at their option, by notice from the Administrative Agent to the Borrower (which notice may be revoked at the option of the Required Lenders notwithstanding any provision of Section 8.3 requiring unanimous consent of the Lenders to changes in interest rates), declare that (i) each Eurodollar Advance shall bear interest for the remainder of the applicable Interest Period at the rate otherwise applicable to such Interest Period plus 2.00% per annum, (ii) each Base Rate Advance shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate in effect from time to time plus 2.00% per annum, and (iii) the LC Fee shall be increased by 2.00% per annum, provided that, during the continuance of an Event of Default under Sections 7.2, 7.6 or 7.7, the interest rates set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) above and the increase in the LC Fee set forth in clause (iii) above shall be applicable automatically to all Credit Extensions without any election or action on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender.  After an Event of Default has been waived, the interest rate applicable to advances and the LC Fee shall revert to the rates applicable prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default.2.12.    Method of Payment; Repayment of Term Loans.(a)    All payments of the Obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be made, without setoff, deduction, or counterclaim, in immediately available funds to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent’s address specified pursuant to Article XIII, or at any other Lending Installation of the Administrative Agent specified in writing by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower, by 12:00 noon (local time in Denver, Colorado) on the date when due and shall (except (i) with respect to repayments of Swing Line Loans, (ii) in the case of Reimbursement Obligations for which the LC Issuer has not been fully indemnified by the Lenders, or (iii) as otherwise specifically required hereunder) be applied ratably by the Administrative Agent among the Lenders.  Each payment delivered to the Administrative Agent for the account of any Lender shall be delivered promptly by the Administrative Agent to such Lender in the same type of funds that the Administrative Agent received at its address specified pursuant to Article XIII or at any Lending Installation specified in a notice received by the Administrative Agent from such Lender.  The Administrative Agent is hereby authorized to charge the account of the Borrower maintained with U.S. Bank for each payment of principal, interest, Reimbursement Obligations and fees as it becomes due hereunder.  Each reference to the Administrative Agent in this Section 2.12 shall also be deemed to refer, and shall apply equally, to the LC Issuer, in the case of payments required to be made by the Borrower to the LC Issuer pursuant to Section 2.19(f).(b)    The Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Revolving Loan on the Revolving Loan Termination Date applicable for such Revolving Loan.  Beginning with the period ending March 31, 2019 and on the last day of each fiscal quarter thereafter (or, if such date is not a Business Day, on the immediately preceding Business Day), the Borrower shall make quarterly payments of principal on the Five-Year Term Loans in an amount equal to one and one quarter percent (1.25%) of the initial aggregate principal amount of the Five-Year Term Loans.

Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the Indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.(a)    The Administrative Agent shall also maintain accounts in which it will record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder and Type thereof and the Interest Period with respect thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder, (iii) the original stated amount of each Facility LC and the amount of LC Obligations outstanding at any time, and (iv) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder from the Borrower and each Lender’s share thereof.(b)    The entries maintained in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) above shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the Obligations therein recorded; provided, however, that the failure of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Obligations in accordance with their terms.(c)    Any Lender (including the Swing Line Lender) may request that its Loans be evidenced by a promissory note representing its 364-Day Revolving Loans, Five-Year Revolving Loans, Swing Line Loans, Five-Year Term Loans and Seven-Year Term Loans, respectively, substantially in the form of Exhibit D-1, D-2, D-3 or D-4, as applicable (with appropriate changes for notes evidencing Swing Line Loans) (each a “Note”).  In such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender such Note or Notes payable to such Lender in a form supplied by the Administrative Agent.  Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such Note or Notes and interest thereon shall at all times (prior to any assignment pursuant to Section 12.3) be represented by one or more Notes payable to the payee named therein (and its registered assigns), except to the extent that any such Lender subsequently returns any such Note for cancellation and requests that such Loans once again be evidenced as described in clauses (b) (i) and (ii) above.2.14.    Telephonic Notices.  The Borrower hereby authorizes the Lenders and the Administrative Agent to extend, convert or continue Advances, effect selections of Types of Advances and to transfer funds based on telephonic notices made by any Person or Persons the Administrative Agent or any Lender in good faith believes to be acting on behalf of the Borrower, it being understood that the foregoing authorization is specifically intended to allow Borrowing Notices and Conversion/Continuation Notices to be given telephonically.  The Borrower agrees to deliver promptly to the Administrative Agent a written confirmation (which may include e-mail) of each telephonic notice authenticated by an Authorized Officer. If the written confirmation differs in any material respect from the action taken by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, the records of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall govern absent manifest error.  The parties agree to prepare appropriate documentation to correct any such error within ten (10) days after discovery by any party to this Agreement.2.15.    Interest Payment Dates; Interest and Fee Basis.  Interest accrued on each Base Rate Advance and each Swing Line Loan shall be payable on each Payment Date, commencing with the first such Payment Date to occur after the date hereof and at maturity.  Interest accrued on each Eurodollar Advance shall be payable on the last day of its applicable Interest Period, on any date on which the Eurodollar Advance is prepaid, whether by acceleration or otherwise, and at maturity.  Interest accrued on each Eurodollar Advance having an Interest Period longer than three (3) months shall also be payable on the last day of each three-month interval during such Interest Period.  Interest accrued pursuant to Section 2.11 shall be payable on demand.  Interest on all Advances and fees shall be calculated for actual days elapsed on the basis of a 360-day year, except that interest computed by reference to the Alternate Base Rate shall be calculated for actual days elapsed on the basis of a 365/366-day year.  Interest shall be payable for the day an Advance is made but not for the day of any payment on the amount paid if payment is received prior to 12:00 noon (local time in Denver, Colorado) at the place of payment.  If any payment of principal of or interest on an Advance shall become due on a day (other than a Payment Date) which is not a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day.2.16.    Notification of Advances, Interest Rates, Prepayments and Commitment Reductions.  Promptly after receipt thereof, the Administrative Agent will notify each Lender of the contents of each Commitment reduction notice, Borrowing Notice, Swing Line Borrowing Notice, Conversion/Continuation Notice, and repayment notice received by it hereunder.  Promptly after notice from the LC Issuer, the Administrative Agent will notify each Lender of the contents of each request for issuance of a Facility LC hereunder.  The Administrative Agent will notify each Lender of the currency and interest rate applicable to each Eurodollar Advance promptly upon determination of such interest rate and will give each Lender prompt notice of each change in the Alternate Base Rate.2.17.    Lending Installations.  Each Lender may book its Advances and its participation in any LC Obligations and the LC Issuer may book the Facility LCs at any Lending Installation selected by such Lender or the LC Issuer, as the case may be, and may change its Lending Installation from time to time.  All terms of this Agreement shall apply to any such Lending Installation and the Loans, Facility LCs, participations in LC Obligations and any Notes issued hereunder shall be deemed held by each Lender or the LC Issuer, as the case may be, for the benefit of any such Lending Installation.  Each Lender and the LC Issuer may, by written notice to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower in accordance with Article XIII, designate replacement or additional Lending Installations through which Loans will be made by it or Facility LCs will be issued by it and for whose account Loan payments or payments with respect to Facility LCs are to be made.2.18.    Non-Receipt of Funds by the Administrative Agent.  Unless the Borrower or a Lender, as the case may be, notifies the Administrative Agent prior to the date on which it is scheduled to make payment to the Administrative Agent of (i) in the case of a Lender, the proceeds of a Loan or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, a payment of principal, interest or fees to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders, that it does not intend to make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such payment has been made.  The Administrative Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, make the amount of such payment available to the intended recipient in reliance upon such assumption.  If such Lender or the Borrower, as the case may be, has not in fact made such payment to the Administrative Agent, the recipient of such payment shall, on demand by the Administrative Agent, repay to the Administrative Agent the amount so made available together with interest thereon in respect of each day during the period commencing on the date such amount was so made available by the Administrative Agent until the date the Administrative Agent recovers such amount at a rate per annum equal to (x) in the case of payment by a Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation or (y) in the case of payment by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the relevant Loan.2.19.    Facility LCs.(a)    Issuance and Existing Letters of Credit.  Upon the termination of the Existing Credit Agreement, each of the Existing LCs shall be deemed for all purposes of this Agreement to be a Facility LC issued hereunder and the applicable LC Issuer shall be deemed to have sold to each Lender, and each Lender shall be deemed to have purchased from such LC Issuer, without further action by any party hereto, a participating interest in such Existing LC in proportion to such Lender’s Five-Year Revolving Pro Rata Share of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Existing LC.  Fees shall accrue in respect of the Existing LCs as provided in Section 2.19(d) of this Agreement beginning as of the Effective Date, but the Borrower shall receive full credit for fees paid in advance with respect to such Existing LCs.  The LC Issuer hereby agrees, on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, to issue standby and commercial Letters of Credit denominated in Dollars (each, a “Facility LC”) and to renew, extend, increase, decrease or otherwise modify each Facility LC (“Modify,” and each such action a “Modification”), from time to time from and including the date of this Agreement and prior to the Five-Year Revolving Loan Termination Date upon the request of the Borrower; provided that immediately after each such Facility LC is issued or Modified, (i) the aggregate amount of the outstanding LC Obligations shall not exceed $100,000,000, (ii) the aggregate amount of the Five-Year Revolving Exposures shall not exceed the aggregate Five-Year Revolving Commitments, (iii) the Aggregate Outstanding Credit Exposure shall not exceed the Aggregate Commitment.  No Facility LC shall have an expiry date later than the earlier to occur of (x) the fifth Business Day prior to the Five-Year Revolving Loan Termination Date and (y) one (1) year after its issuance; provided, however, that the expiry date of a Facility LC may be up to one (1) year later than the fifth Business Day prior to the Five-Year Revolving Loan Termination Date if the Borrower has posted on or before the fifth Business Day prior to the Five-Year Revolving Loan Termination Date cash collateral in the Facility LC Collateral Account on terms satisfactory to the Administrative Agent in an amount equal to 103% of the LC Obligations with respect to such Facility LC.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the LC Issuer shall have no obligation hereunder to issue any Facility LC the proceeds of which would be made available to any Person (i) to fund any activity or business of or with any Sanctioned Person, or in any country or territory that, at the time of such funding, is the subject of any Sanctions or (ii) in any manner that would result in a violation of any Sanctions by any party to this Agreement.  (b)    Participations.  Upon the issuance or Modification by the LC Issuer of a Facility LC, the LC Issuer shall be deemed, without further action by any party hereto, to have unconditionally and irrevocably sold to each Lender, and each Lender shall be deemed, without further action by any party hereto, to have unconditionally and irrevocably purchased from the LC Issuer, a participation in such Facility LC (and each Modification thereof) and the related LC Obligations in proportion to its Five-Year Revolving Pro Rata Share.  For the avoidance of doubt, no 364-Day Revolving Loan Lender shall have any obligations under this Section 2.19.(c)    Notice.  Subject to Section 2.19(a), the Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent notice prior to 11:00 a.m. (Denver, Colorado time) at least five (5) Business Days prior to the proposed date of issuance or Modification of each Facility LC, specifying the beneficiary, the proposed date of issuance (or Modification) and the expiry date of such Facility LC, and describing the proposed terms of such Facility LC and the nature of the transactions proposed to be supported thereby.  Upon receipt of such notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the LC Issuer and each Lender of the contents thereof and of the amount of such Lender’s participation in such proposed Facility LC.  The issuance or Modification by the LC Issuer of any Facility LC shall, in addition to the conditions precedent set forth in Article IV, be subject to the conditions precedent that such Facility LC shall be satisfactory to the LC Issuer and that the Borrower shall have executed and delivered such application agreement and/or such other instruments and agreements relating to such Facility LC as the LC Issuer shall have reasonably requested (each, a “Facility LC Application”).  The LC Issuer shall have no independent duty to ascertain whether the conditions set forth in Article IV have been satisfied; provided, however, that the LC Issuer shall not issue a Facility LC if, on or before the proposed date of issuance, the LC Issuer shall have received notice from the Administrative Agent or the Required Five-Year Revolving Lenders that any such condition has not been satisfied or waived.  In the event of any conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of any Facility LC Application, the terms of this Agreement shall control.(d)    LC Fees.  The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Five-Year Revolving Lenders ratably in accordance with their respective Five-Year Revolving Pro Rata Shares, with respect to each Facility LC, a letter of credit fee at a per annum rate equal to the Applicable Margin for Eurodollar Loans in effect from time to time on the average daily undrawn stated amount under such Facility LC, such fee to be payable in arrears on each Payment Date (the “LC Fee”).  The Borrower shall also pay to the LC Issuer for its own account (x) a fronting fee in an amount equal to 0.125% per annum of the average daily undrawn stated amount under such Facility LC, such fee to be payable in arrears on each Payment Date and (y) on demand, all amendment, drawing and other fees regularly charged by the LC Issuer to its letter of credit customers and all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the LC Issuer in connection with the issuance, Modification, administration or payment of any Facility LC.(e)    Administration; Reimbursement by Lenders.  Upon receipt of any demand for payment under any Facility LC from the beneficiary of such Facility LC, the LC Issuer shall notify the Administrative Agent and the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and each other Lender as to the amount to be paid by the LC Issuer as a result of such demand and the proposed payment date (the “LC Payment Date”).  The responsibility of the LC Issuer to the Borrower and each Lender shall be only to determine that the documents (including each demand for payment) delivered under each Facility LC in connection with such presentment shall be in conformity in all material respects with such Facility LC.  The LC Issuer shall endeavor to exercise the same care in the issuance and administration of the Facility LCs as it does with respect to letters of credit in which no participations are granted, it being understood that in the absence of any gross negligence or willful misconduct by the LC Issuer, each Lender shall be unconditionally and irrevocably liable without regard to the occurrence of any Event of Default or any condition precedent whatsoever, to reimburse the LC Issuer on demand for (i) such Five-Year Revolving Lender’s Five-Year Revolving Pro Rata Share of the amount of each payment made by the LC Issuer under each Facility LC to the extent such amount is not reimbursed by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.19(f) below and there are not funds available in the Facility LC Collateral Account to cover the same, plus (ii) interest on the foregoing amount to be reimbursed by such Lender, for each day from the date of the LC Issuer’s demand for such reimbursement (or, if such demand is made after 11:00 a.m. (local time in Denver, Colorado) on such date, from the next succeeding Business Day) to the date on which such Lender pays the amount to be reimbursed by it at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.(f)    Reimbursement by Borrower.  The Borrower shall be irrevocably and unconditionally obligated to reimburse the LC Issuer on or before the applicable LC Payment Date for any amounts to be paid by the LC Issuer upon any drawing under any Facility LC, without presentment, demand, protest or other formalities of any kind; provided that neither the Borrower nor any Lender shall hereby be precluded from asserting any claim for direct (but not consequential) damages suffered by the Borrower or such Lender to the extent, but only to the extent, caused by (i) the willful misconduct or gross negligence of the LC Issuer in determining whether a request presented under any Facility LC issued by it complied with the terms of such Facility LC or (ii) the LC Issuer’s failure to pay under any Facility LC issued by it after the presentation to it of a request strictly complying with the terms and conditions of such Facility LC.  All such amounts paid by the LC Issuer and remaining unpaid by the Borrower shall bear interest, payable on demand, for each day until paid at a rate per annum equal to (x) the rate applicable to Base Rate Advances for such day if such day falls on or before the applicable LC Payment Date and (y) the sum of 2.00% per annum plus the rate applicable to Base Rate Advances for such day if such day falls after such LC Payment Date.  The LC Issuer will pay to each Lender ratably in accordance with its Pro Rata Share all amounts received by it from the Borrower for application in payment, in whole or in part, of the Reimbursement Obligation in respect of any Facility LC issued by the LC Issuer, but only to the extent such Lender has made payment to the LC Issuer in respect of such Facility LC pursuant to Section 2.19(e).  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including without limitation the submission of a Borrowing Notice in compliance with Section 2.8 and the satisfaction of the applicable conditions precedent set forth in Article IV), the Borrower may request an Advance hereunder for the purpose of satisfying any Reimbursement Obligation.(g)    Obligations Absolute.  The Borrower’s obligations under this Section 2.19 shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances and irrespective of any setoff, counterclaim or defense to payment which the Borrower may have or have had against the LC Issuer, any Lender or any beneficiary of a Facility LC.  The Borrower further agrees with the LC Issuer and the Lenders that the LC Issuer and the Lenders shall not be responsible for, and the Borrower’s Reimbursement Obligation in respect of any Facility LC shall not be affected by, among other things, the validity or genuineness of documents or of any endorsements thereon, even if such documents should in fact prove to be in any or all respects invalid, fraudulent or forged, or any dispute between or among the Borrower, any of its Affiliates, the beneficiary of any Facility LC or any financing institution or other party to whom any Facility LC may be transferred or any claims or defenses whatsoever of the Borrower or of any of its Affiliates against the beneficiary of any Facility LC or any such transferee.  The LC Issuer shall not be liable for any error, omission, interruption or delay in transmission, dispatch or delivery of any message or advice, however transmitted, in connection with any Facility LC.  The Borrower agrees that any action taken or omitted by the LC Issuer or any Lender under or in connection with each Facility LC and the related drafts and documents, if done without gross negligence or willful misconduct, shall be binding upon the Borrower and shall not put the LC Issuer or any Lender under any liability to the Borrower.  Nothing in this Section 2.19(g) is intended to limit the right of the Borrower to make a claim against the LC Issuer for damages as contemplated by the proviso to the first sentence of Section 2.19(f).(h)    Actions of LC Issuer.  The LC Issuer shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any Facility LC, draft, writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, cablegram, telegram, facsimile, telex, teletype or electronic mail message, statement, order or other document believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel, independent accountants and other experts selected by the LC Issuer.  The LC Issuer shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement unless it shall first have received such advice or concurrence of the Required Five-Year Revolving Lenders as it reasonably deems appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its reasonable satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.19, the LC Issuer shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement in accordance with a request of the Required Five-Year Revolving Lenders, and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon the Lenders and any future holders of a participation in any Facility LC.(i)    Indemnification.  The Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Lender, the LC Issuer and the Administrative Agent, and their respective directors, officers, agents and employees from and against any and all claims and damages, losses, liabilities, costs or expenses (including reasonable counsel fees and disbursements) which such Lender, the LC Issuer or the Administrative Agent may incur (or which may be claimed against such Lender, the LC Issuer or the Administrative Agent by any Person whatsoever) by reason of or in connection with the issuance, execution and delivery or transfer of or payment or failure to pay under any Facility LC or any actual or proposed use of any Facility LC, including, without limitation, any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs or expenses (including reasonable counsel fees and disbursements) which the LC Issuer may incur (i) by reason of or in connection with the failure of any other Lender to fulfill or comply with its obligations to the LC Issuer hereunder (but nothing herein contained shall affect any rights the Borrower may have against any Defaulting Lender) or (ii) by reason of or on account of the LC Issuer issuing any Facility LC which specifies that the term “Beneficiary” included therein includes any successor by operation of law of the named Beneficiary, but which Facility LC does not require that any drawing by any such successor Beneficiary be accompanied by a copy of a legal document, satisfactory to the LC Issuer, evidencing the appointment of such successor Beneficiary; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to indemnify any Lender, the LC Issuer or the Administrative Agent for any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs or expenses to the extent, but only to the extent, caused by (x) the willful misconduct or gross negligence of the LC Issuer in determining whether a request presented under any Facility LC complied with the terms of such Facility LC or (y) the LC Issuer’s failure to pay under any Facility LC after the presentation to it of a request strictly complying with the terms and conditions of such Facility LC. Nothing in this Section 2.19(i) is intended to limit the obligations of the Borrower under any other provision of this Agreement.  This Section 2.19(i) shall not apply with respect to Taxes other than any Taxes that represent losses, claims, damages, etc. arising from any non-Tax claim.(j)    Lenders’ Indemnification.  Each Lender shall, ratably in accordance with its Pro Rata Share, indemnify the LC Issuer, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, agents and employees (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower) against any cost, expense (including reasonable counsel fees and disbursements), claim, demand, action, loss or liability (except such as result from such indemnitees’ gross negligence or willful misconduct or the LC Issuer’s failure to pay under any Facility LC after the presentation to it of a request strictly complying with the terms and conditions of the Facility LC) that such indemnitees may suffer or incur in connection with this Section 2.19 or any action taken or omitted by such indemnitees hereunder.(k)    Facility LC Collateral Account.  The Borrower agrees that it will, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or the Required Five-Year Revolving Lenders and until the final expiration date of any Facility LC and thereafter as long as any amount is payable to the LC Issuer or the Lenders in respect of any Facility LC, maintain a special collateral account pursuant to arrangements satisfactory to the Administrative Agent (the “Facility LC Collateral Account”), in the name of such Borrower but under the sole dominion and control of the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders and in which such Borrower shall have no interest other than as set forth in Section 8.1.  The Borrower hereby pledges, assigns and grants to the Administrative Agent, on behalf of and for the ratable benefit of the Lenders and the LC Issuer, a security interest in all of the Borrower’s right, title and interest in and to all funds which may from time to time be on deposit in the Facility LC Collateral Account to secure the prompt and complete payment and performance of the Obligations.  The Administrative Agent will invest any funds on deposit from time to time in the Facility LC Collateral Account in certificates of deposit of U.S. Bank having a maturity not exceeding thirty (30) days.  Nothing in this Section 2.19(k) shall either obligate the Administrative Agent to require the Borrower to deposit any funds in the Facility LC Collateral Account or limit the right of the Administrative Agent to release any funds held in the Facility LC Collateral Account in each case other than as required by Section 2.22 or Section 8.1.(l)    Rights as a Lender.  In its capacity as a Lender, the LC Issuer shall have the same rights and obligations as any other Lender.(m)    Separate Reimbursement Agreement.  In the event the LC Issuer enters into a separate reimbursement agreement with the Borrower covering the Facility LCs and the terms of such reimbursement agreement conflict with or contradict the terms of this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall control.2.20.    Replacement of Lender.  If the Borrower is required pursuant to Sections 3.1, 3.2 or 3.5 to make any additional payment to any Lender or if any Lender’s obligation to make or continue, or to convert Base Rate Advances into Eurodollar Advances shall be suspended pursuant to Section 3.3 or if any Lender defaults in its obligation to make a Loan, reimburse the LC Issuer pursuant to Section 2.19(e) or the Swing Line Lender pursuant to Section 2.4(d) or declines to approve an amendment or waiver that is approved by the Required Lenders or otherwise becomes a Defaulting Lender (any Lender so affected an “Affected Lender”), the Borrower may elect, if such amounts continue to be charged or such suspension is still effective, to replace such Affected Lender as a Lender party to this Agreement, provided that no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such replacement, and provided further that, concurrently with such replacement, (i) another bank or other entity which is reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent and, to the Borrower’s and the Administrative Agent’s reasonable satisfaction, which other bank or entity does not suffer from and is not impacted by the issue or event causing the replacement of the Affected Lender, shall agree, as of such date, to purchase for cash at par the Advances and other Obligations due to the Affected Lender under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents pursuant to an assignment substantially in the form of Exhibit B and to become a Lender for all purposes under this Agreement and to assume all obligations of the Affected Lender to be terminated as of such date and to comply with the requirements of Section 12.3 applicable to assignments, and (ii) the Borrower shall pay to such Affected Lender in same day funds on the day of such replacement (A) all interest, fees and other amounts then accrued but unpaid to such Affected Lender by the Borrower hereunder to and including the date of termination, including without limitation payments due to such Affected Lender under Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 and 3.5, and (B) an amount, if any, equal to the payment which would have been due to such Lender on the day of such replacement under Section 3.4 had the Loans of such Affected Lender been prepaid on such date rather than sold to the replacement Lender.2.21.    Limitation of Interest.  The Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders intend to strictly comply with all applicable laws, including applicable usury laws.  Accordingly, the provisions of this Section 2.21 shall govern and control over every other provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document which conflicts or is inconsistent with this Section 2.21, even if such provision declares that it controls.  As used in this Section 2.21, the term “interest” includes the aggregate of all charges, fees, benefits or other compensation which constitute interest under applicable law, provided that, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, (a) any non-principal payment shall be characterized as an expense or as compensation for something other than the use, forbearance or detention of money and not as interest, and (b) all interest at any time contracted for, reserved, charged or received shall be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread, in equal parts during the full term of this Agreement.  In no event shall the Borrower or any other Person be obligated to pay, or any Lender have any right or privilege to reserve, receive or retain, (a) any interest in excess of the maximum amount of nonusurious interest permitted under the applicable laws (if any) of the United States or of any applicable state, or (b) total interest in excess of the amount which such Lender could lawfully have contracted for, reserved, received, retained or charged had the interest been calculated for the full term of this Agreement at the Highest Lawful Rate.  On each day, if any, that the interest rate (the “Stated Rate”) called for under this Agreement or any other Loan Document exceeds the Highest Lawful Rate, the rate at which interest shall accrue shall automatically be fixed by operation of this sentence at the Highest Lawful Rate for that day, and shall remain fixed at the Highest Lawful Rate for each day thereafter until the total amount of interest accrued equals the total amount of interest which would have accrued if there were no such ceiling rate as is imposed by this sentence.  Thereafter, interest shall accrue at the Stated Rate unless and until the Stated Rate again exceeds the Highest Lawful Rate when the provisions of the immediately preceding sentence shall again automatically operate to limit the interest accrual rate.  The daily interest rates to be used in calculating interest at the Highest Lawful Rate shall be determined by dividing the applicable Highest Lawful Rate per annum by the number of days in the calendar year for which such calculation is being made.  None of the terms and provisions contained in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document which directly or indirectly relate to interest shall ever be construed without reference to this Section 2.21, or be construed to create a contract to pay for the use, forbearance or detention of money at an interest rate in excess of the Highest Lawful Rate.  If the term of any Loan or any other Obligation outstanding hereunder or under the other Loan Documents is shortened by reason of acceleration of maturity as a result of any Event of Default or by any other cause, or by reason of any required or permitted prepayment, and if for that (or any other) reason any Lender at any time, including but not limited to, the stated maturity, is owed or receives (and/or has received) interest in excess of interest calculated at the Highest Lawful Rate, then and in any such event all of any such excess interest shall be canceled automatically as of the date of such acceleration, prepayment or other event which produces the excess, and, if such excess interest has been paid to such Lender, it shall be credited pro tanto against the then-outstanding principal balance of the Borrower’s Obligations to such Lender, effective as of the date or dates when the event occurs which causes it to be excess interest, until such excess is exhausted or all of such principal has been fully paid and satisfied, whichever occurs first, and any remaining balance of such excess shall be promptly refunded to its payor.  2.22.    Defaulting Lenders.(a)    Defaulting Lender Adjustments.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as such Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable law:(i)Waivers and Amendments.  Such Defaulting Lender’s right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in the definition of Required Lenders.(ii)Defaulting Lender Waterfall. Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Article VII or otherwise) or received by the Administrative Agent from a Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 11.1 shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder; second, to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the LC Issuer and Swing Line Lender hereunder; third, to Cash Collateralize the LC Issuer’s Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender in accordance with Section 2.22(d); fourth, as the Borrower may request (so long as no Default or Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent; fifth, if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to be held in a deposit account (including the Facility LC Collateral Account) and released pro rata in order to (x) satisfy such Defaulting Lender’s potential future funding obligations with respect to Loans under this Agreement and (y) Cash Collateralize the LC Issuer’s future Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender with respect to future Facility LCs issued under this Agreement, in accordance with Section 2.22(d); sixth, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders, the LC Issuer or Swing Line Lender as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender, the LC Issuer or Swing Line Lender against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; seventh, so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender's breach of its obligations under this Agreement; eighth, if so determined by the Administrative Agent, distributed to the Lenders other than the Defaulting Lender until the ratio of the Revolving Exposures of such Lenders to the aggregate Revolving Exposures of all Revolving Lenders equals such ratio immediately prior to the Defaulting Lender’s failure to fund any portion of any Loans or participations in Facility LCs or Swing Line Loans; and ninth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans or Facility LC issuances in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share, and (y) such Loans were made or the related Facility LCs were issued at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 4.2 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Credit Extensions of all Non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Credit Extensions of such Defaulting Lender until such time as all Loans and funded and unfunded participations in LC Obligations and Swing Line Loans are held by the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the Commitments without giving effect to Section 2.22(a)(iv). Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section 2.22(a)(ii) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.(iii)Certain Fees. (A) No Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive any commitment fee for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and the Borrower shall not be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender).  (B)    Each Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive LC Fees for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender only to the extent allocable to its ratable share of the stated amount of Facility LCs for which it has provided Cash Collateral pursuant to Section 2.22(d).  (C)    With respect to any LC Fee not required to be paid to any Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (A) or (B) above, the Borrower shall (x) pay to each Non-Defaulting Lender that portion of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender with respect to such Defaulting Lender’s participation in LC Obligations or Swing Line Loans that has been reallocated to such Non-Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (iv) below, (y) pay to the LC Issuer and Swing Line Lender, as applicable, the amount of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender to the extent allocable to the LC Issuer’s or Swing Line Lender’s Fronting Exposure to such Defaulting Lender, and (z) not be required to pay the remaining amount of any such fee.(iv)Reallocation of Participations to Reduce Fronting Exposure.  All or any part of such Defaulting Lender’s participation in LC Obligations and Swing Line Loans shall be reallocated among the Non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Five-Year Revolving Pro Rata Shares (calculated without regard to such Defaulting Lender’s Commitment) but only to the extent that (x) the conditions set forth in Section 4.2 are satisfied at the time of such reallocation (and, unless the Borrower shall have otherwise notified the Administrative Agent at such time, the Borrower shall be deemed to have represented and warranted that such conditions are satisfied at such time), and (y) such reallocation does not cause the aggregate Five-Year Revolving Exposure of any Non-Defaulting Lender to exceed such Non-Defaulting Lender’s Five-Year Revolving Commitment.  Subject to Section 9.15, no reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a Non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such Non-Defaulting Lender’s increased exposure following such reallocation.(v)Cash Collateral, Repayment of Swing Line Loans.  If the reallocation described in clause (iv) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrower shall, without prejudice to any right or remedy available to it hereunder or under law, (x) first, prepay Swing Line Loans in an amount equal to the Swing Line Lender’s Fronting Exposure and (y) second, Cash Collateralize the LC Issuer’s Fronting Exposure in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.22(d).(b)    Defaulting Lender Cure.  If the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Swing Line Lender and the LC Issuer agree in writing that a Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any Cash Collateral), that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Facility LCs and Swing Line Loans to be held pro rata by the Lenders in accordance with the Commitments (without giving effect to Section 2.22(a)(iv)), whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender’s having been a Defaulting Lender.(c)    New Swing Line Loans/Facility LCs.  So long as any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, (i) the Swing Line Lender shall not be required to fund any Swing Line Loans unless it is satisfied that it will have no Fronting Exposure after giving effect to such Swing Line Loan and (ii) the LC Issuer shall not be required to issue, extend, renew or increase any Facility LC unless it is satisfied that it will have no Fronting Exposure after giving effect thereto.(d)    Cash Collateral.  At any time that there shall exist a Defaulting Lender, within one (1) Business Day following the written request of the Administrative Agent or the LC Issuer (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) the Borrower shall Cash Collateralize the LC Issuer’s Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender (determined after giving effect to Section 2.22(a)(iv) and any Cash Collateral provided by such Defaulting Lender) in an amount not less than the Minimum Collateral Amount.(i)Grant of Security Interest.  The Borrower, and to the extent provided by any Defaulting Lender, such Defaulting Lender, hereby grants to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the LC Issuer, and agrees to maintain, a first priority security interest in all such Cash Collateral as security for the Defaulting Lender’s obligation to fund participations in respect of LC Obligations, to be applied pursuant to clause (ii) below.  If at any time the Administrative Agent determines that Cash Collateral is subject to any right or claim of any Person other than the Administrative Agent and the LC Issuer as herein provided, or that the total amount of such Cash Collateral is less than the Minimum Collateral Amount, the Borrower will, promptly upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay or provide to the Administrative Agent additional Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to eliminate such deficiency (after giving effect to any Cash Collateral provided by the Defaulting Lender).(ii)Application.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Cash Collateral provided under this Section 2.22 in respect of Facility LCs shall be applied to the satisfaction of the Defaulting Lender’s obligation to fund participations in respect of LC Obligations (including, as to Cash Collateral provided by a Defaulting Lender, any interest accrued on such obligation) for which the Cash Collateral was so provided, prior to any other application of such Property as may otherwise be provided for herein.(iii)Termination of Requirement.  Cash Collateral (or the appropriate portion thereof) provided to reduce the LC Issuer’s Fronting Exposure shall no longer be required to be held as Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section 2.22(d) following (i) the elimination of the applicable Fronting Exposure (including by the termination of Defaulting Lender status of the applicable Lender), or (ii) the determination by the Administrative Agent and the LC Issuer that there exists excess Cash Collateral; provided that, subject to this Section 2.22 the Person providing Cash Collateral and the LC Issuer may agree that Cash Collateral shall be held to support future anticipated Fronting Exposure or other obligations.2.23.    [Reserved].  2.24.    Judgment Currency.  If for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due from the Borrower hereunder in the currency expressed to be payable herein (the “specified currency”) into another currency, the parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent that they may effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Administrative Agent could purchase the specified currency with such other currency at the Administrative Agent’s offices on the Business Day preceding that on which final, non-appealable judgment is given.  The obligations of the Borrower in respect of any sum due to any Lender or the Administrative Agent hereunder shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency other than the specified currency, be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) of any sum adjudged to be so due in such other currency such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) may in accordance with normal, reasonable banking procedures purchase the specified currency with such other currency.  If the amount of the specified currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, in the specified currency, the Borrower agrees, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, against such loss, and if the amount of the specified currency so purchased exceeds (a) the sum originally due to any Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, in the specified currency and (b) any amounts shared with other Lenders as a result of allocations of such excess as a disproportionate payment to such Lender under Section 11.2, such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, agrees to remit such excess to the Borrower.2.25.    Increase Option.  The Borrower may from time to time elect to increase the Five-Year Revolving Commitments or enter into one or more tranches of additional Term Loans (each an “Incremental Term Loan”), in each case in minimum increments of $25,000,000 or such lower amount as the Borrower and the Administrative Agent agree upon, so long as, after giving effect thereto, the aggregate amount of such increases and all such Incremental Term Loans does not exceed $400,000,000.  The Borrower may arrange for any such increase or tranche to be provided by one or more Lenders (each Lender so agreeing to an increase in Five-Year Revolving Commitment, or to participate in such Incremental Term Loans, an “Increasing Lender”), or by one or more new banks, financial institutions or other entities that are Eligible Assignees (each such new bank, financial institution or other entity, an “Augmenting Lender”), to increase their existing Five-Year Revolving Commitment, or to participate in such Incremental Term Loans, or extend Five-Year Revolving Commitments, as the case may be; provided that (i) each Augmenting Lender and each Increasing Lender shall be subject to the approval of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the LC Issuer, in each case not to be unreasonably withheld, and (ii) (x) in the case of an Increasing Lender, the Borrower and such Increasing Lender execute an agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit E hereto, and (y) in the case of an Augmenting Lender, the Borrower and such Augmenting Lender execute an agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit F hereto.  No consent of any Lender (other than the Lenders participating in the increase or any Incremental Term Loan) shall be required for any increase in Five-Year Revolving Commitment or Incremental Term Loans pursuant to this Section 2.25.  Increases and new Five-Year Revolving Commitments and Incremental Term Loans created pursuant to this Section 2.25 shall become effective on the date agreed by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the relevant Increasing Lenders or Augmenting Lenders, and the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender thereof.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no increase in the Five-Year Revolving Commitment (of any Five-Year Revolving Lender) or tranche of Incremental Term Loans shall become effective under this paragraph unless, (i) on the proposed date of the effectiveness of such increase or Incremental Term Loans, (A) the conditions set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of Section 4.2 shall be satisfied or waived by the Required Lenders and the Administrative Agent shall have received a certificate to that effect dated such date and executed by an Authorized Officer of the Borrower and (B) the Borrower shall be in compliance (on a pro forma basis reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent) with the covenants contained in Section 6.4 and (ii) the Administrative Agent shall have received documents consistent with those delivered on the Effective Date as to the corporate power and authority of the Borrower to borrow hereunder after giving effect to such increase, as well as such documents as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request (including, without limitation, customary opinions of counsel, affirmations of Loan Documents and updated financial projections, reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent, demonstrating the Borrower’s anticipated compliance with Section 6.4 through the Seven-Year Term Loan Maturity Date).  On the effective date of any increase in the Five-Year Revolving Commitment or any Incremental Term Loans being made, (i) each relevant Increasing Lender and Augmenting Lender shall make available to the Administrative Agent such amounts in immediately available funds as the Administrative Agent shall determine, for the benefit of the other Lenders, as being required in order to cause, after giving effect to such increase and the use of such amounts to make payments to such other Lenders, each Lender’s portion of the outstanding Revolving Loans of all the Lenders to equal its Pro Rata Share of such outstanding Revolving Loans, and (ii) except in the case of any Incremental Term Loans, the Borrower shall be deemed to have repaid and reborrowed all outstanding Revolving Loans as of the date of any increase in the Revolving Commitments (with such reborrowing to consist of the Types of Revolving Loans, with related Interest Periods if applicable, specified in a notice delivered by the Borrower, in accordance with the requirements of Section 2.3).  The deemed payments made pursuant to clause (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence shall be accompanied by payment of all accrued interest on the amount prepaid and, in respect of each Eurodollar Loan, shall be subject to indemnification by the Borrower pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.4 if the deemed payment occurs other than on the last day of the related Interest Periods.  The Incremental Term Loans (a) shall rank pari passu in right of payment with the Revolving Loans and the initial Term Loans, (b) shall not mature earlier than the Five-Year Term Loan Maturity Date (but may have amortization prior to such date) and (c) shall be treated substantially the same as (and in any event no more favorably than) the Revolving Loans and the initial Term Loans; provided that (i) the terms and conditions applicable to any tranche of Incremental Term Loans maturing after the Five-Year Revolving Loan Termination Date may provide for material additional or different financial or other covenants or prepayment requirements applicable only during periods after the Five-Year Revolving Loan Termination Date and (ii) the Incremental Term Loans may be priced differently than the Revolving Loans and the initial Term Loans.  Incremental Term Loans may be made hereunder pursuant to an amendment or restatement (an “Incremental Term Loan Amendment”) of this Agreement and, as appropriate, the other Loan Documents, executed by the Borrower, each Increasing Lender participating in such tranche, each Augmenting Lender participating in such tranche, if any, and the Administrative Agent.  The Incremental Term Loan Amendment may, without the consent of any other Lenders, effect such amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent, to effect the provisions of this Section 2.25.  On the effective date of the issuance of the Incremental Term Loans, each Term Lender that has agreed to extend such an Incremental Term Loan shall make its ratable share thereof available to the Administrative Agent, for remittance to the Borrower, on the terms and conditions specified by the Administrative Agent at such time.  Nothing contained in this Section 2.25 shall constitute, or otherwise be deemed to be, a commitment on the part of any Lender to increase its Revolving Commitment hereunder, or provide Incremental Term Loans, at any time.This Section 2.25 shall supersede any provision in Section 8.3 to the contrary. 2.26.    Extensions of 364-Day Revolving Commitments.(a)    The Borrower may from time to time, pursuant to the provisions of this Section 2.26, agree with one or more Lenders holding 364-Day Revolving Commitments to extend the termination date, and otherwise modify the terms of such 364-Day Revolving Commitments or any portion thereof (including, without limitation, by increasing the interest rate or fees payable in respect of such Commitments or any portion thereof) (each such modification, an “Extension”) pursuant to one or more written offers (each, an “Extension Offer”) made from time to time by the Borrower to all 364-Day Revolving Lenders, in each case on a pro rata basis (based on their respective 364-Day Revolving Pro Rata Shares) and on the same terms to each such Lender.  In connection with each Extension, the Borrower will provide notification to the Administrative Agent (for distribution to the 364-Day Revolving Lenders), no later than thirty (30) days prior to the 364-Day Revolving Loan Termination Date of a requested new termination date of no later than one-year after the then-existing 364-Day Revolving Loan Termination Date for the extended 364-Day Revolving Commitments (each an “Extended 364-Day Revolving Loan Termination Date”), a reset of the 364-Day Revolving Facility Availability Period and the due date for Lender responses.  In connection with any Extension, each Lender wishing to participate in such Extension shall, prior to such due date, provide the Administrative Agent with a written notice thereof in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.  Any Lender that does not respond to an Extension Offer by the applicable due date shall be deemed to have rejected such Extension.  (b)    Each Extension shall be subject to the following:(i)no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time any Extension Offer is delivered to the Lenders or at the time of such Extension;(ii)except as to termination date, the 364-Day Revolving Commitment of any Lender extended pursuant to any Extension shall have the same terms as the 364-Day Revolving Commitments of the Lenders that did not agree to the Extension Offer (including, without limitation, with respect to interest and fees);(iii)the final termination date of the 364-Day Revolving Commitments to be extended pursuant to an Extension shall be later than the final termination date of the Commitments of the Lenders that did not agree to the Extension Offer;(iv)if the aggregate amount of 364-Day Revolving Commitments in respect of which Lenders shall have accepted an Extension Offer exceeds the maximum aggregate amount of 364-Day Revolving Commitments offered to be extended by the Borrower pursuant to the relevant Extension Offer, then such 364-Day Revolving Commitments shall be extended ratably up to such maximum amount based on the relative 364-Day Revolving Commitments of the Lenders that accepted such Extension Offer;(v)all documentation in respect of such Extension shall be consistent with the foregoing, and all written communications by the Borrower generally directed to the applicable Lenders in connection therewith shall be in form and substance consistent with the foregoing and otherwise reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent;(vi)any applicable Minimum Extension Condition shall be satisfied; (vii)any outstanding 364-Day Revolving Loans shall be paid in full at the time of such Extension; (viii)the 364-Day Revolving Facility Availability Period shall be reset after giving effect to such Extension; and(ix)no Extension shall become effective unless, on the proposed effective date of such Extension, the conditions set forth in Section 4.3 shall be satisfied (with all references in such Section to a request for a Loan being deemed to be references to the Extension on the applicable date of such Extension), and the Administrative Agent shall have received a certificate to that effect dated the applicable date of such Extension and executed by an Authorized Officer of the Borrower.(c)    The consummation and effectiveness of any Extension will be subject to a condition set forth in the relevant Extension Offer (a “Minimum Extension Condition”) that a minimum amount be agreed to by the Lenders subject to such Extension (to be determined in the Borrower’s discretion and specified in the relevant Extension Offer).  For the avoidance of doubt, it is understood and agreed that the provisions of Section 11.2 will not apply to Extensions of 364-Day Revolving Commitments pursuant to Extension Offers made pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.26, including to any payment of interest or fees in respect of any 364-Day Revolving Commitments or 364-Day Revolving Loans that have been extended or made pursuant to an Extension at a rate or rates different from those paid or payable in respect of 364-Day Revolving Commitments or 364-Day Revolving Loans of Lenders that did not extend their 364-Day Revolving Commitments, in each case as is set forth in the relevant Extension Offer.(d)    The Lenders hereby irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent to enter into amendments (collectively, “Extension Amendments”) to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary in order to establish new classes of Commitments and Revolving Loans created pursuant to an Extension, in each case on terms consistent with this Section 2.26.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrative Agent shall have the right (but not the obligation) to seek the advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders with respect to any matter contemplated by this Section 2.26 and, if the Administrative Agent seeks such advice or concurrence, the Administrative Agent shall be permitted to enter into such amendments with the Borrower in accordance with any instructions received from such Required Lenders and shall also be entitled to refrain from entering into such amendments with the Borrower unless and until it shall have received such advice or concurrence; provided, however, that whether or not there has been a request by the Administrative Agent for any such advice or concurrence, all such Extension Amendments entered into with the Borrower by the Administrative Agent hereunder shall be binding on the Lenders. Without limiting the foregoing, in connection with any Extension, the Borrower and any Subsidiary shall execute such agreements, confirmations or other documentation as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably request to accomplish the purposes of this Section 2.26.   (e)    In connection with any Extension, the Borrower shall provide the Administrative Agent at least ten (10) Business Days’ (or such shorter period as may be agreed by the Administrative Agent) prior written notice thereof, and shall agree to such procedures, if any, as may be reasonably established by, or acceptable to, the Administrative Agent to accomplish the purposes of this Section 2.26.This Section 2.26 shall supersede any provision in Section 8.3 to the contrary.  ARTICLE IIIYIELD PROTECTION; TAXES3.1.    Yield Protection.  If, on or after the date of this Agreement, there occurs any Change in Law which:(a)    subjects any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation, the LC Issuer, or the Administrative Agent to any Taxes (other than with respect to Indemnified Taxes, Excluded Taxes, and Other Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto, or(b)    imposes or increases or deems applicable any reserve, assessment, insurance charge, special deposit, liquidity or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation or the LC Issuer (other than reserves and assessments taken into account in determining the interest rate applicable to Eurodollar Advances and Daily Eurodollar Loans), or(c)    imposes any other condition (other than Taxes) the result of which is to increase the cost to any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation or the LC Issuer of making, funding or maintaining its Eurodollar Loans or Daily Eurodollar Loans, or of issuing or participating in Facility LCs, or reduces any amount receivable by any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation or the LC Issuer in connection with its Eurodollar Loans, or Daily Eurodollar Loans, Facility LCs or participations therein, or requires any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation or the LC Issuer to make any payment calculated by reference to the amount of Eurodollar Loans, or Daily Eurodollar Loans, Facility LCs or participations therein held or interest or LC Fees received by it, by an amount deemed material by such Lender or the LC Issuer as the case may be,and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Person of making or maintaining its Loans or Commitment or of issuing or participating in Facility LCs or to reduce the amount received by such Person in connection with such Loans or Commitment, Facility LCs or participations therein, then, within fifteen (15) days after demand by such Person, the Borrower shall pay such Person, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Person for such increased cost or reduction in amount received.  Failure or delay on the part of any such Person to demand compensation pursuant to this Section 3.1 shall not constitute a waiver of such Person’s right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Person pursuant to this Section 3.1 for any increased costs or reductions suffered more than 270 days prior to the date that such Person notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Person’s intention to claim compensation therefor; provided further, that if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 270-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.3.2.    Changes in Capital Adequacy Regulations.  If a Lender or the LC Issuer determines that the amount of capital or liquidity required or expected to be maintained by such Lender or the LC Issuer, any Lending Installation of such Lender or the LC Issuer, or any corporation or holding company controlling such Lender or the LC Issuer is increased as a result of (i) a Change in Law or (ii) any change on or after the date of this Agreement in the Risk-Based Capital Guidelines, then, within fifteen (15) days after demand by such Lender or the LC Issuer, the Borrower shall pay such Lender or the LC Issuer the amount necessary to compensate for any shortfall in the rate of return on the portion of such increased capital or liquidity which such Lender or the LC Issuer determines is attributable to this Agreement, its Outstanding Credit Exposure or its Commitment to make Loans and issue or participate in Facility LCs, as the case may be, hereunder (after taking into account such Lender’s or the LC Issuer’s policies as to capital adequacy or liquidity), in each case that is attributable to such Change in Law or change in the Risk-Based Capital Guidelines, as applicable.  Failure or delay on the part of such Lender or the LC Issuer to demand compensation pursuant to this Section 3.2 shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s or the LC Issuer’s right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate any Lender or the LC Issuer pursuant to this Section 3.2 for any shortfall suffered more than 270 days prior to the date that such Lender or the LC Issuer notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law or change in the Risk-Based Capital Guidelines giving rise to such shortfall and of such Lender’s or the LC Issuer’s intention to claim compensation therefor; provided further, that if the Change in Law or change in Risk-Based Capital Guidelines giving rise to such shortfall is retroactive, then the 270-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.3.3.    Availability of Types of Advances; Adequacy of Interest Rate.  (a)    If the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders determine (i)that deposits of a type and maturity appropriate to match fund Eurodollar Advances or Daily Eurodollar Loans are not available to such Lenders in the relevant market, or(ii)that the interest rate applicable to Eurodollar Advances or Daily Eurodollar Loans is not ascertainable or does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost of making or maintaining Eurodollar Advances or Daily Eurodollar Loans, then the Administrative Agent shall suspend the availability of Eurodollar Advances or Daily Eurodollar Loans and require any affected Eurodollar Advances or Daily Eurodollar Loans to be repaid or converted to Base Rate Advances, subject to the payment of any funding indemnification amounts required by Section 3.4.(b)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that (i) the circumstances set forth in Section 3.3(a)(ii) have arisen and such circumstances are unlikely to be temporary, (ii) ICE Benchmark Administration (or any Person that takes over the administration of such rate) discontinues its administration and publication of interest settlement rates for deposits in Dollars, or (iii) the supervisor for the administrator of the interest settlement rate described in clause (ii) of this Section 3.3(b) or a Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the Administrative Agent has made a public statement identifying a specific date after which such interest settlement rate shall no longer be used for determining interest rates for loans, then the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall seek to jointly agree upon an alternate rate of interest to the Eurodollar Base Rate and the Daily Eurodollar Base Rate that gives due consideration to the  then prevailing market convention for determining a rate of interest for syndicated loans in the United States at such time, and the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall enter into an amendment to this Agreement to reflect such alternate rate of interest and such other related changes to this Agreement as may be applicable.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 8.3, such amendment shall become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement so long as the Administrative Agent shall not have received, within five Business Days of the date notice of such alternate rate of interest is provided to the Lenders, a written notice from the Required Lenders stating that such Required Lenders object to such amendment.  Until an alternate rate of interest shall be determined in accordance with this Section 3.3(b), (x) any request pursuant to Section 2.9 that requests the conversion of any Advance to, or continuation of any Advance as, a Eurodollar Advance shall be ineffective and any such Advance shall be continued as or converted to, as the case may be, a Base Rate Advance, and (y) if any request pursuant to Section 2.8 requests a Eurodollar Advance, such Advance shall be made as a Base Rate Advance.  If the alternate rate of interest determined pursuant to this Section 3.3(b) shall be less than zero, such rate shall be deemed to be zero for the purposes of this Agreement.3.4.    Funding Indemnification.  If (a) any payment of a Eurodollar Advance occurs on a date which is not the last day of the applicable Interest Period, whether because of acceleration, prepayment or otherwise, (b) a Eurodollar Advance is not made on the date specified by the Borrower for any reason other than default by the Lenders, (c) a Eurodollar Loan is converted other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (d) the Borrower fails to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Eurodollar Advance on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto, or (e) any Eurodollar Advance is assigned other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.20, the Borrower will indemnify each Lender for such Lender’s costs, expenses and Interest Differential (as determined by such Lender) incurred as a result of such prepayment.  The term “Interest Differential” shall mean that sum equal to the greater of zero or the financial loss incurred by the Lender resulting from prepayment, calculated as the difference between the amount of interest such Lender would have earned (from the investments in money markets as of the Borrowing Date of such Advance) had prepayment not occurred and the interest such Lender will actually earn (from like investments in money markets as of the date of prepayment) as a result of the redeployment of funds from the prepayment.  Because of the short-term nature of this facility, Borrower agrees that Interest Differential shall not be discounted to its present value.The Borrower hereby acknowledges that the Borrower shall be required to pay Interest Differential with respect to any portion of the principal balance paid or that becomes due before its scheduled due date, whether voluntarily, involuntarily, or otherwise, including, without limitation, any principal payment made following default, demand for payment, acceleration, collection proceedings, foreclosure, sale or other disposition of collateral, bankruptcy or other insolvency proceedings, eminent domain, condemnation or otherwise.  Such prepayment fee shall at all times be an Obligation as well as an undertaking by the Borrower to the Lenders whether arising out of a voluntary or mandatory prepayment.3.5.    Taxes. (a)  Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable law.  If any applicable law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable Withholding Agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a Withholding Agent, then the applicable Withholding Agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 3.5) the applicable Lender or the Administrative Agent receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made.(b)  The Loan Parties shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes.(c)    The Loan Parties shall indemnify each Lender or the Administrative Agent, within fifteen (15) days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 3.5) payable or paid by such Lender or the Administrative Agent or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Lender or the Administrative Agent and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.(d)    Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within fifteen (15) days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Loan Parties to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 12.2(d) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register, and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this paragraph (d).(e)  As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by any Loan Party to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section 3.5, such Loan Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.(f)    (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent and at the time or times prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent or prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding.  In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 3.5(f)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.(ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,(A) any Lender that is a United States Person for U.S. federal income Tax purposes shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding Tax; (B) any Non-U.S. Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Non-U.S. Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:(1)  in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender claiming the benefits of an income Tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “interest” article of such Tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “business profits” or “other income” article of such Tax treaty;(2)  executed copies of IRS Form W-8ECI;(3)    in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate satisfactory to Borrower to the effect that such Non-U.S. Lender is not a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a “10 percent shareholder” of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a “controlled foreign corporation” related to the Borrower as described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a “U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate”) and (y) executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E; or(4)    to the extent a Non-U.S. Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed copies of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E, an appropriate U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate, IRS Form W-8IMY or IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Non-U.S. Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Non-U.S. Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Non-U.S. Lender may provide an appropriate U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner.(C)  any Non-U.S. Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Non-U.S. Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and(D) if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount, if any, to deduct and withhold from such payment.  Solely for purposes of this clause (D), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.(iii)    Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.(g)    If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 3.5 (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section 3.5), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section 3.5 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund).  Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph (g) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (g), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph (g) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid.  This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.(h)    Each party’s obligations under this Section 3.5 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document.(i)    For purposes of Section 3.5, the term “Lender” includes the LC Issuer.3.6.    Selection of Lending Installation; Mitigation Obligations; Lender Statements; Survival of Indemnity.  To the extent reasonably possible, each Lender shall designate an alternate Lending Installation with respect to its Eurodollar Loans or Daily Eurodollar Loans (in the case of the Swing Line Lender) to reduce any liability of the Borrower to such Lender under Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.5 or to avoid the unavailability of Eurodollar Advances or Daily Eurodollar Loans under Section 3.3, so long as such designation is not, in the judgment of such Lender, disadvantageous to such Lender.  Each Lender shall deliver a written statement of such Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) as to the amount due, if any, under Section 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 or 3.5.  Such written statement shall set forth in reasonable detail the calculations upon which such Lender determined such amount and shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Borrower in the absence of manifest error.  Determination of amounts payable under such Sections in connection with a Eurodollar Loan or Daily Eurodollar Loan shall be calculated as though each Lender funded its Eurodollar Loan and the Swing Line Lender funded its Daily Eurodollar Loan through the purchase of a deposit of the type and maturity corresponding to the deposit used as a reference in determining the Eurodollar Rate or Daily Eurodollar Rate applicable to such Loan, whether in fact that is the case or not.  Unless otherwise provided herein, the amount specified in the written statement of any Lender shall be payable on demand after receipt by the Borrower of such written statement.  The obligations of the Borrower under Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 and 3.5 shall survive payment of the Obligations and termination of this Agreement.3.7.    Illegality.  If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable lending office to make, maintain, or fund Advances whose interest is determined by reference to the Eurodollar Rate, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the London interbank market, then, upon notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower (through the Administrative Agent), (a) any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Eurodollar Advances or to convert Base Rate Advances to Eurodollar Advances shall be suspended, and (b) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or maintaining Base Rate Advances the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate, the interest rate on which Base Rate Advances of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate, in each case until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, (i) the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all Eurodollar Advances of such Lender to Base Rate Advances (the interest rate on which Base Rate Advances of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Advances to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Advances and (ii) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the Eurodollar Rate component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate.  Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.4.ARTICLE IV CONDITIONS PRECEDENT4.1.    Initial Credit Extension.

(a) If any Event of Default described in Section 7.6 or 7.7 occurs with respect to the Borrower, the obligations of the Lenders to make Loans hereunder and the obligation and power of the LC Issuer to issue Facility LCs shall automatically terminate and the Obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall immediately become due and payable without any election or action on the part of the Administrative Agent, the LC Issuer or any Lender and the Borrower will be and become thereby unconditionally obligated, without any further notice, act or demand, to pay to the Administrative Agent an amount in immediately available funds, which funds shall be held in the Facility LC Collateral Account, equal to the difference of (x) the amount of LC Obligations at such time, less (y) the amount on deposit in the Facility LC Collateral Account at such time which is free and clear of all rights and claims of third parties and has not been applied against the Obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (such difference, the “Collateral Shortfall Amount”).  If any other Event of Default occurs, the Administrative Agent may, and (i) at the request of the Required Five-Year Revolving Lenders or Required 364-Day Revolving Lenders, as applicable, shall, terminate or suspend the obligations of the Five-Year Revolving Lenders or 364-Day Revolving Lenders to make Five-Year Revolving Loans or 364-Day Revolving Loans, as applicable, hereunder and the obligation and power of the LC Issuer to issue Facility LCs, or (ii) at the request of the Required Lenders shall declare the Obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to be due and payable, or both, whereupon the Obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall become immediately due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or notice of any kind, all of which the Borrower hereby expressly waives.  In addition, the Administrative Agent may, and at the request of the Required Five-Year Revolving Lenders shall, upon notice to the Borrower and in addition to the continuing right to demand payment of all amounts payable under this Agreement, make demand on the Borrower to pay, and the Borrower will, forthwith upon such demand and without any further notice or act, pay to the Administrative Agent the Collateral Shortfall Amount, which funds shall be deposited in the Facility LC Collateral Account.(a)    If at any time while any Event of Default is continuing, the Administrative Agent determines that the Collateral Shortfall Amount at such time is greater than zero, the Administrative Agent may make demand on the Borrower to pay, and the Borrower will, forthwith upon such demand and without any further notice or act, pay to the Administrative Agent the Collateral Shortfall Amount, which funds shall be deposited in the Facility LC Collateral Account.(b)    The Administrative Agent may at any time or from time to time after funds are deposited in the Facility LC Collateral Account, apply such funds to the payment of the Obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and any other amounts as shall from time to time have become due and payable by the Borrower to the Lenders or the LC Issuer under the Loan Documents, as provided in Section 8.2.(c)    At any time while any Event of Default is continuing, neither the Borrower nor any Person claiming on behalf of or through the Borrower shall have any right to withdraw any of the funds held in the Facility LC Collateral Account.  After all of the Obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents have been indefeasibly paid in full and the Aggregate Commitment has been terminated, any funds remaining in the Facility LC Collateral Account shall be returned by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower or paid to whomever may be legally entitled thereto at such time.(d)    If, within thirty (30) days after acceleration of the maturity of the Obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents or termination of the obligations of the Lenders to make Loans and the obligation and power of the LC Issuer to issue Facility LCs hereunder as a result of any Event of Default (other than any Event of Default as described in Section 7.6 or 7.7 with respect to the Borrower) and before any judgment or decree for the payment of the Obligations due under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall have been obtained or entered, the Required Lenders (in their sole discretion) shall so direct, the Administrative Agent shall, by notice to the Borrower, rescind and annul such acceleration and/or termination.(e)    Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of any Event of Default, the Administrative Agent may, and at the request of the Required Lenders shall, exercise all rights and remedies under the Loan Documents and enforce all other rights and remedies under applicable law.8.2.    Application of Funds.  After the exercise of remedies provided for in Section 8.1 (or after the Obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents have automatically become immediately due and payable as set forth in the first sentence of Section 8.1(a)), any amounts received by the Administrative Agent on account of the Obligations shall be applied by the Administrative Agent in the following order:(a)    First, to payment of fees, indemnities, expenses and other amounts (including fees, charges and disbursements of counsel to the Administrative Agent and amounts payable under Article III) payable to the Administrative Agent in its capacity as such;(b)    second, to payment of fees, indemnities and other reimbursable expenses (other than principal, interest, LC Fees and commitment fees) payable to the Lenders and the LC Issuer (including fees, charges and disbursements of counsel to the respective Lenders and the LC Issuer as required by Section 9.6 and amounts payable under Article III);(c)    third, to payment of accrued and unpaid LC Fees, commitment fees and interest on the Loans and Reimbursement Obligations, ratably among the Lenders and the LC Issuer in respect of the respective amounts described in this Section 8.2(c) payable to them;(d)    fourth, to payment of all Obligations ratably among the Lenders, the LC Issuer and any Affiliate of any of the foregoing, including with respect to Lender-Provided Swaps and Cash Management Services; (e)    fifth, to the Administrative Agent for deposit to the Facility LC Collateral Account in an amount equal to the Collateral Shortfall Amount (as defined in Section 8.1(a)), if any; and(f)    last, the balance, if any, to the Borrower or as otherwise required by law;provided, however, that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth above, Excluded Swap Obligations with respect to any Guarantor shall not be paid with amounts received from such Guarantor or its assets, but appropriate adjustments shall be made with respect to payments from other Loan Parties to preserve the allocation to Obligations otherwise set forth above in this Section 8.2.Notwithstanding the foregoing, Obligations arising under Lender-Provided Swaps and Cash Management Services shall be excluded from the application described above if the Administrative Agent has not received written notice thereof, together with such supporting documentation as the Administrative Agent may request, from the applicable Lender (or Affiliate of a Lender) in accordance with the definition of “Obligations”; provided, that the Administrative Agent shall be deemed to have notice of Obligations under Lender-Provided Swaps and Cash Management Services that are owing to Lenders that also were “Lenders” under the Existing Credit Agreement and that arose during their time as “Lenders” under the Existing Credit Agreement.  Each Affiliate of a Lender that has given the notice contemplated by the preceding sentence shall, by such notice, be deemed to have acknowledged and accepted the appointment of the Administrative Agent pursuant to the terms of Article X for itself and its Affiliates as if a “Lender” party hereto.  In addition, amounts on deposit in the Facility LC Collateral Account shall be used to pay Obligations owing under or in connection with Facility LCs prior to paying other Obligations.8.3.    Amendments.  Except with respect to an Incremental Term Loan Amendment as provided in Section 2.25 or in connection with an increase in the Aggregate Commitment under Section 2.25 (which, in each case, shall be governed by such Section), subject to the provisions of this Section 8.3, the Required Lenders (or the Administrative Agent with the consent in writing of the Required Lenders) and the Borrower may enter into agreements supplemental hereto for the purpose of adding or modifying any provisions to this Agreement, the Guaranty or changing in any manner the rights of the Lenders or the Borrower hereunder or thereunder or waiving any Default or Event of Default hereunder; provided, however, that no such supplemental agreement shall:(a)    without the consent of each Lender directly affected thereby, extend the final maturity of any Loan, or extend the expiry date of any Facility LC to a date after the Five-Year Revolving Loan Termination Date or postpone any regularly scheduled payment of principal of any Loan (excluding mandatory repayments) or forgive all or any portion of the principal amount thereof or any Reimbursement Obligation related thereto, or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest or fees thereon or Reimbursement Obligations related thereto or increase the amount of the Commitment of such Lender hereunder (provided that only the consent of the Required Lenders shall be necessary (x) to amend Section 2.11 or to waive the obligation of the Borrower to pay default interest as set forth in Section 2.11 or (y) to amend any financial covenant (or any defined term directly or indirectly used therein), even if the effect of such amendment would be to reduce the rate of interest on any Loan or other Obligation or to reduce any fee payable hereunder);  (b)    without the consent of all of the Lenders, amend the definition of Required Lenders, Required Five-Year Revolving Lenders, Required 364-Day Revolving Lenders, or amend any of the provisions hereof specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or modify any rights hereunder or make any determination or grant any consent hereunder;(c)    without the consent of all of the Lenders, amend Section 8.2, this Section 8.3, Section 11.2, or any other provision providing for the pro rata sharing of payments received by, and reimbursement of funding obligations of, the Lenders; provided, that the foregoing limitation in respect of Section 11.2 shall not prohibit each Lender directly affected thereby from consenting to the extension of the final maturity date of its Loans or expiry date of its Facility LCs beyond the Five-Year Revolving Loan Termination Date as contemplated by Section 8.3(a) above;(d)    waive any condition set forth in Section 4.2 as to any Credit Extension under the Five-Year Revolving Commitments without the written consent of the Required Five-Year Revolving Lenders (it being understood and agreed that a waiver or an amendment to a covenant, default or any other provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document (other than Section 4.2) shall not constitute a waiver of any condition set forth in Section 4.2);(e)    waive any condition set forth in Section 4.3 (other than Section 4.3(b), which also shall require the approval of the Required Five-Year Revolving Lenders) as to any Credit Extension under the 364-Day Revolving Commitments without the written consent of the Required 364-Day Revolving Lenders (it being understood and agreed that a waiver or an amendment to a covenant, default or any other provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document (other than Section 4.3) shall not constitute a waiver of any condition set forth in Section 4.3); or(f)    without the consent of all of the Lenders, release all or substantially all of the Guarantors of the Obligations.No amendment of any provision of this Agreement relating to the Administrative Agent shall be effective without the written consent of the Administrative Agent, and no amendment of any provision relating to the LC Issuer shall be effective without the written consent of the LC Issuer.  No amendment to any provision of this Agreement relating to the Swing Line Lender or any Swing Line Loans shall be effective without the written consent of the Swing Line Lender.  The Administrative Agent may waive payment of the fee required under Section 12.3(c) without obtaining the consent of any other party to this Agreement.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Administrative Agent may, with the consent of the Borrower only, amend, modify or supplement this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents to cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect or inconsistency of a technical or immaterial nature, as determined in good faith by the Administrative Agent.8.4.    Preservation of Rights.  No delay or omission of the Lenders, the LC Issuer or the Administrative Agent to exercise any right under the Loan Documents shall impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of any Event of Default or an acquiescence therein, and the making of a Credit Extension notwithstanding the existence of an Event of Default or the inability of the Borrower to satisfy the conditions precedent to such Credit Extension shall not constitute any waiver or acquiescence.  Any single or partial exercise of any such right shall not preclude other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, and no waiver, amendment or other variation of the terms, conditions or provisions of the Loan Documents whatsoever shall be valid unless in writing signed by the Lenders required pursuant to Section 8.3, and then only to the extent in such writing specifically set forth.  All remedies contained in the Loan Documents or by law afforded shall be cumulative and all shall be available to the Administrative Agent, the LC Issuer and the Lenders until the Obligations have been paid in full.8.5.    Rights and Remedies; Waiver of Rights under Farm Credit Act.  Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, the Administrative Agent may with the consent of the Required Lenders (subject to the provisions of the other Loan Documents), and shall at the direction of the Required Lenders, proceed to protect and enforce the rights of the Lenders as set forth in this Section 8.5.  The Administrative Agent may proceed by suit in equity, by action at law or both, whether for the specific performance of any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document or in aid of the exercise of any power granted in this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (i) to enforce the payment of the Obligations, or (ii) to foreclose upon any liens, claims, security interests and/or encumbrances granted pursuant to this Agreement and other Loan Documents in the manner set forth therein; it being intended that no remedy conferred herein or in any of the other Loan Documents is to be exclusive of any other remedy, and each and every remedy contained herein or in any other Loan Document shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every other remedy given hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, or at any time existing at law or in equity or by statute or otherwise.  The Administrative Agent shall have, in addition to any other rights and remedies contained in this Agreement or in any of the other Loan Documents, all of the rights and remedies of a secured party under the Code or other applicable laws. The Borrower, having been represented by legal counsel in connection with this Agreement and, in particular, in connection with the waiver contained in this Section 8.5, does hereby voluntarily and knowingly waive, relinquish and agree not to assert at any time, any and all rights that the Borrower may have or be afforded under the sections of the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987 designated as 12 U.S.C. Sections 2199 through 2202e and the implementing Farm Credit Administration regulations as set forth in 12 C.F.R. Section 617.000 through 617.7630, including those provisions which afford the Borrower certain rights, and/or impose on any lender to the Borrower certain duties, with respect to the collection of any amounts, or which require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to disclose to the Borrower the nature of any such rights or duties.  This waiver is given by the Borrower pursuant to the provisions of 12 C.F.R. Section 617.7010(c) to include the Administrative Agent and the Lenders to fund and extend to the Borrower the credit facilities described herein and to induce those Lenders which are Farm Credit System Institutions to agree to provide such credit facilities commensurate with their Commitments as they may exist from time to time.ARTICLE IXGENERAL PROVISIONS9.1.    Survival of Representations.  All representations and warranties of the Borrower contained in this Agreement shall survive the making of the Credit Extensions herein contemplated.9.2.    Governmental Regulation.  Anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, neither the LC Issuer nor any Lender shall be obligated to extend credit to the Borrower in violation of any limitation or prohibition provided by any applicable statute or regulation.9.3.    Headings.  Section headings in the Loan Documents are for convenience of reference only, and shall not govern the interpretation of any of the provisions of the Loan Documents.9.4.    Entire Agreement.  The Loan Documents embody the entire agreement and understanding among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the LC Issuer and the Lenders and supersede all prior agreements and understandings among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the LC Issuer and the Lenders relating to the subject matter thereof other than those contained in the Fee Letters which shall survive and remain in full force and effect during the term of this Agreement.9.5.    Several Obligations; Benefits of this Agreement.  The respective obligations of the Lenders hereunder are several and not joint and no Lender shall be the partner or agent of any other (except to the extent to which the Administrative Agent is authorized to act as such).  The failure of any Lender to perform any of its obligations hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender from any of its obligations hereunder.  This Agreement shall not be construed so as to confer any right or benefit upon any Person other than the parties to this Agreement and their respective successors and assigns, provided, however, that the parties hereto expressly agree that the Arranger shall enjoy the benefits of the provisions of Sections 9.6, 9.10 and 10.11 to the extent specifically set forth therein and shall have the right to enforce such provisions on its own behalf and in its own name to the same extent as if it were a party to this Agreement.9.6.    Expenses; Indemnification.  (a)    The Borrower shall reimburse the Administrative Agent and the Arranger upon demand for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses paid or incurred by the Administrative Agent or the Arranger, including, without limitation, filing and recording costs and fees, costs of any environmental review, and consultants’ fees, travel expenses and reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of outside counsel to the Administrative Agent and the Arranger and/or the allocated costs of in-house counsel incurred from time to time, in connection with the due diligence, preparation, administration, negotiation, execution, delivery, syndication, distribution (including, without limitation, via DebtX and any other internet service selected by the Administrative Agent), review, amendment, modification, and administration of the Loan Documents, and expenses incurred in connection with assessing and responding to any subpoena, garnishment or similar process served on the Administrative Agent relating to the Borrower, any Guarantor, any Loan Document or the extensions of credit evidenced thereby.  The Borrower also agrees to reimburse the Administrative Agent, the Arranger, the LC Issuer and the Lenders for any costs, internal charges and out-of-pocket expenses, including, without limitation, filing and recording costs and fees, costs of any environmental review, and consultants’ fees, travel expenses and reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of outside counsel to the Administrative Agent, the Arranger, the LC Issuer and the Lenders and/or the allocated costs of in-house counsel incurred from time to time, paid or incurred by the Administrative Agent, the Arranger, the LC Issuer or any Lender in connection with the collection and enforcement of the Loan Documents.  Expenses being reimbursed by the Borrower under this Section 9.6(a) include, without limitation, costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Reports described in the following sentence.  The Borrower acknowledges that from time to time U.S. Bank may prepare and may distribute to the Lenders (but shall have no obligation or duty to prepare or to distribute to the Lenders) certain audit reports (the “Reports”) pertaining to the Borrower’s assets for internal use by U.S. Bank from information furnished to it by or on behalf of the Borrower, after U.S. Bank has exercised its rights of inspection pursuant to this Agreement.(b)    The Borrower hereby further agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative Agent, the Arranger, the LC Issuer, each Lender, their respective affiliates, and each of their directors, officers and employees, agents and advisors (each, an “Indemnified Party”) against all losses, claims, damages, penalties, judgments, liabilities and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees, charges and disbursements and settlement costs (including, without limitation, all expenses of litigation or preparation therefor) whether or not the Indemnified Party is a party thereto) which any such Indemnified Party may pay or incur arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, the transactions contemplated hereby, any actual or alleged presence or release of hazardous materials on or from any Property owned or operated by any Consolidated Financial Covenant Entity, any environmental liability related in any way to the Consolidated Financial Covenant Entities, or any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory, whether brought by a third party or by any Consolidated Financial Covenant Entity, or the direct or indirect application or proposed application of the proceeds of any Credit Extension hereunder except to the extent that they are determined in a final non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the applicable Indemnified Party.  The obligations of the Borrower under this Section 9.6 shall survive the termination of this Agreement.  This Section 9.6(b) shall not apply with respect to Taxes other than any Taxes that represent losses, claims, damages, etc. arising from any non-Tax claim.9.7.    [Reserved].  9.8.    Accounting.  Except as provided to the contrary herein, all accounting terms used herein shall be interpreted and all accounting determinations hereunder shall be made in accordance with GAAP in a manner consistent with that used in preparing the financial statements referred to in Section 5.13, including, without limitation, references to “Consolidated” meaning, unless otherwise specified, the consolidation of accounts in accordance with GAAP; provided, however that, notwithstanding any other provision contained herein, all terms of an accounting or financial nature used herein shall be construed, and all computations of amounts and ratios referred to herein shall be made without giving effect to (i) any election under Accounting Standards Codification Section 825-10-25 (or any other Accounting Standards Codification or Financial Accounting Standard having a similar result or effect) to value any Indebtedness or other liabilities of the Consolidated Financial Covenant Entities at “fair value”, as defined therein, or (ii) any treatment of Indebtedness in respect of convertible debt instruments under Financial Accounting Standards Codification Subtopic 470-20 (or any other Accounting Standards Codification or Financial Accounting Standard having a similar result or effect) to value any such Indebtedness in a reduced or bifurcated manner as described therein, and such Indebtedness shall at all times be valued at the full stated principal amount thereof.  If at any time any change in GAAP would affect the computation of any financial ratio or requirement set forth in any Loan Document, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders shall so request, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Borrower shall negotiate in good faith to amend such ratio or requirement to preserve the original intent thereof in light of such change in GAAP (subject to the approval of the Required Lenders), provided that, until so amended, such ratio or requirement shall continue to be computed in accordance with GAAP prior to such change therein and the Borrower shall provide to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders reconciliation statements showing the difference in such calculation, together with the delivery of monthly, quarterly and annual financial statements required hereunder.  In addition, notwithstanding any other provision contained herein, the definitions set forth in this Agreement and any financial calculations required by the Loan Documents shall be computed to exclude any change to lease accounting rules from those in effect pursuant to Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 840 (Leases) and other related lease accounting guidance as in effect on November 14, 2018.9.9.    Severability of Provisions.  Any provision in any Loan Document that is held to be inoperative, unenforceable, or invalid in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be inoperative, unenforceable, or invalid without affecting the remaining provisions in that jurisdiction or the operation, enforceability, or validity of that provision in any other jurisdiction, and to this end the provisions of all Loan Documents are declared to be severable.9.10.    Nonliability of Lenders.  The relationship between the Borrower on the one hand and the Lenders, the LC Issuer and the Administrative Agent on the other hand shall be solely that of borrower and lender.  Neither the Administrative Agent, the Arranger, the LC Issuer nor any Lender shall have any fiduciary responsibilities to the Borrower.  Neither the Administrative Agent, the Arranger, the LC Issuer nor any Lender undertakes any responsibility to the Borrower to review or inform the Borrower of any matter in connection with any phase of the Borrower’s business or operations.  The Borrower agrees that neither the Administrative Agent, the Arranger, the LC Issuer nor any Lender shall have liability to the Borrower (whether sounding in tort, contract or otherwise) for losses suffered by the Borrower in connection with, arising out of, or in any way related to, the transactions contemplated and the relationship established by the Loan Documents, or any act, omission or event occurring in connection therewith, unless it is determined in a final non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction that such losses resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the party from which recovery is sought.  Neither the Administrative Agent, the Arranger, the LC Issuer, any Lender, nor any other Indemnified Party shall have any liability with respect to, and the Borrower hereby waives, releases and agrees not to sue for, any lost profits or special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages suffered by the Borrower in connection with, arising out of, or in any way related to the Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated thereby; provided that nothing contained in this sentence shall limit or otherwise relieve the Borrower’s indemnity obligations under Section 9.6(b).  It is agreed that the Arranger shall, in its capacity as such, have no duties or responsibilities under the Agreement or any other Loan Document.

No successor Administrative Agent shall be deemed to be appointed hereunder until such successor Administrative Agent has accepted the appointment.

Upon the effectiveness of the resignation of the Administrative Agent, the resigning Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the Loan Documents.  After the effectiveness of the resignation of an Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Article X shall continue in effect for the benefit of such Administrative Agent in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as the Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents.  In the event that there is a successor to the Administrative Agent by merger, or the Administrative Agent assigns its duties and obligations to an Affiliate pursuant to this Section 10.12, then the term “Prime Rate” as used in this Agreement shall mean the prime rate, base rate or other analogous rate of the new Administrative Agent.10.13.    Administrative Agent and Arranger Fees.

In the event of any such sale by a Lender of participating interests to a Participant, such Lender’s obligations under the Loan Documents shall remain unchanged, such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, such Lender shall remain the owner of its Outstanding Credit Exposure and the holder of any Note issued to it in evidence thereof for all purposes under the Loan Documents, all amounts payable by the Borrower under this Agreement shall be determined as if such Lender had not sold such participating interests, and the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under the Loan Documents.(b)    Voting Rights.  Other than as set forth in Section 12.2(c), each Lender shall retain the sole right to approve, without the consent of any Participant, any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of the Loan Documents provided that each such Lender may agree in its participation agreement with its Participant that such Lender will not vote to approve any amendment, modification or waiver with respect to any Outstanding Credit Exposure or Commitment in which such Participant has an interest which would require consent of all of the Lenders pursuant to the terms of Section 8.3 or of any other Loan Document.(c)    Voting Participants.  Notwithstanding anything in this Section 12.2 to the contrary, any Farm Credit System Institution that (i) has purchased a participation from any Lender that is a Farm Credit System Institution in the minimum amount of $5,000,000 on or after the Effective Date, (ii) is, by written notice to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (a “Voting Participant Notification”), designated by the selling Lender as being entitled to be accorded the rights of a voting participant hereunder (any Farm Credit System Institution so designated being called a “Voting Participant”) and (iii) receives the prior written consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to become a Voting Participant, shall be entitled to vote (and the voting rights of the selling Lender shall be correspondingly reduced), on a dollar for dollar basis, as if such Voting Participant were a Lender, on any matter requiring or allowing a Lender to provide or withhold its consent, or to otherwise vote on any proposed action, in each case, in lieu of the vote of the selling Lender; provided, however, that if such Voting Participant has at any time failed to fund any portion of its participation when required to do so and notice of such failure has been delivered by the selling Lender to the Administrative Agent, then until such time as all amounts of its participation required to have been funded have been funded and notice of such funding has been delivered by the selling Lender to the Administrative Agent, such Voting Participant shall not be entitled to exercise its voting rights pursuant to the terms of this clause (c), and the voting rights of the selling Lender shall not be correspondingly reduced by the amount of such Voting Participant’s participation.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Farm Credit System Institution designated as a Voting Participant on Schedule 12.2(c) hereto on the Effective Date shall be a Voting Participant without delivery of a Voting Participant Notification and without the prior written consent of the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent.  To be effective, each Voting Participant Notification shall, with respect to any Voting Participant, (A) state the full name of such Voting Participant, as well as all contact information required of an assignee as set forth in Exhibit B, (B) state the Dollar amount of the participation purchased and (C) include such other information as may be required by the Administrative Agent.  The selling Lender and the Voting Participant shall notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower within three Business Days of any termination of, or reduction or increase in the amount of, such participation and shall promptly upon request of the Administrative Agent update or confirm there has been no change in the information set forth in Schedule 12.2(c) hereto on the Effective Date or delivered in connection with any Voting Participant Notification.  The Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely on information provided by a Lender identifying itself or its participant as a Farm Credit System Institution without verification thereof and may also conclusively rely on the information set forth in Schedule 12.2(c) hereto on the Effective Date, delivered in connection with any Voting Participant Notification or otherwise furnished pursuant to this clause (c) and, unless and until notified thereof in writing by the selling Lender, may assume that there have been no changes in the identity of Voting Participants, the Dollar amount of participations, the contact information of the participants or any other information furnished to the Borrower or the Administrative Agent pursuant to this clause (c).  The voting rights hereunder are solely for the benefit of the Voting Participants and shall not inure to any assignee or participant of a Voting Participant.(d)    Benefit of Certain Provisions.  The Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be deemed to have the right of setoff provided in Section 11.1 in respect of its participating interest in amounts owing under the Loan Documents to the same extent as if the amount of its participating interest were owing directly to it as a Lender under the Loan Documents, provided that each Lender shall retain the right of setoff provided in Section 11.1 with respect to the amount of participating interests sold to each Participant.  The Lenders agree to share with each Participant, and each Participant, by exercising the right of setoff provided in Section 11.1, agrees to share with each Lender, any amount received pursuant to the exercise of its right of setoff, such amounts to be shared in accordance with Section 11.2 as if each Participant were a Lender.  The Borrower further agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.4, 3.5, 9.6 and 9.10 (subject to the requirements and limitations therein, including the requirements under Section 3.5(f) (it being understood that the documentation required under Section 3.5(f) shall be delivered to the participating Lender)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to Section 12.3, provided that (i) a Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 3.1 or 3.2 than the Lender who sold the participating interest to such Participant would have received had it retained such interest for its own account, unless the sale of such interest to such Participant is made with the prior written consent of the Borrower, and (ii) a Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 3.5 than the Lender who sold the participating interest to such Participant would have received had it retained such interest for its own account except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a change in treaty, law or regulation (or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority) that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation.  Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant’s interest in any Outstanding Credit Exposure, any Note, any Commitment or any other obligations under the Loan Documents (the “Participant Register”); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant's interest in any Outstanding Credit Exposure, any Note, any Commitment or any other obligations under the Loan Documents) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Outstanding Credit Exposure, any Note, any Commitment or any other obligations under the Loan Documents is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations.  The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.12.3.    Assignments.(a)    Permitted Assignments.  Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more Eligible Assignees (“Purchasers”) all or any part of its rights and obligations under the Loan Documents.  Such assignment shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit B or in such other form reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent as may be agreed to by the parties thereto.  Each such assignment with respect to a Purchaser which is not a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund shall either be in an amount equal to the entire applicable Commitment and Outstanding Credit Exposure of the assigning Lender or (unless each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent otherwise consents) be in an aggregate amount not less than $5,000,000.  The amount of the assignment shall be based on the Commitment or Outstanding Credit Exposure (if the Commitment has been terminated) subject to the assignment, determined as of the date of such assignment or as of the “Trade Date,” if the “Trade Date” is specified in the assignment.(b)    Consents.  The consent of the Borrower shall be required prior to an assignment becoming effective unless the Purchaser is a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund, provided that the consent of the Borrower shall not be required if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; provided further that the Borrower shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment unless it shall object thereto by written notice to the Administrative Agent within five (5) Business Days after having received notice thereof.  The consent of the Administrative Agent shall be required prior to an assignment becoming effective.  The consent of each of the LC Issuer and the Swing Line Lender shall be required prior to an assignment of a Five-Year Revolving Commitment becoming effective.  Any consent required under this Section 12.3(b) other than with respect to the LC Issuer or the Swing Line Lender shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.(c)    Effect; Assignment Effective Date.  Upon (i) delivery to the Administrative Agent of an assignment, together with any consents required by Sections 12.3(a) and 12.3(b), and (ii) payment of a $5,000 fee to the Administrative Agent for processing such assignment (unless such fee is waived by the Administrative Agent), such assignment shall become effective on the effective date specified in such assignment.  The assignment shall contain a representation by the Purchaser to the effect that none of the consideration used to make the purchase of the Commitment and Outstanding Credit Exposure under the applicable assignment agreement constitutes Plan Assets and that the rights and interests of the Purchaser in and under the Loan Documents will not be Plan Assets.  On and after the effective date of such assignment, such Purchaser shall for all purposes be a Lender party to this Agreement and any other Loan Document executed by or on behalf of the Lenders and shall have all the rights and obligations of a Lender under the Loan Documents, to the same extent as if it were an original party thereto, and the transferor Lender shall be released with respect to the Commitment and Outstanding Credit Exposure assigned to such Purchaser without any further consent or action by the Borrower, the Lenders or the Administrative Agent.  In the case of an assignment covering all of the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a Lender hereunder but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of, and subject to, those provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents which survive payment of the Obligations and termination of the applicable agreement.  Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 12.3 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with Section 12.2.  Upon the consummation of any assignment to a Purchaser pursuant to this Section 12.3(c), the transferor Lender, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall, if the transferor Lender or the Purchaser desires that its Loans be evidenced by Notes, make appropriate arrangements so that new Notes or, as appropriate, replacement Notes are issued to such transferor Lender and new Notes or, as appropriate, replacement Notes, are issued to such Purchaser, in each case in principal amounts reflecting their respective Commitments, as adjusted pursuant to such assignment.(d)    Register.  The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices in the United States of America, a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts (and stated interest) of the Loans owing to, each Lender, and participations of each Lender in Facility LCs, pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the “Register”).  The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary.  The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and each Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.(e)    Dissemination of Information.  The Borrower authorizes each Lender to disclose to any Participant or Purchaser or any other Person acquiring an interest in the Loan Documents by operation of law (each a “Transferee”) and any prospective Transferee any and all information in such Lender’s possession; provided that each Transferee and prospective Transferee agrees to be bound by Section 9.11 of this Agreement.(f)    Resignation as LC Issuer or Swing Line Lender after Assignment.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if at any time U.S. Bank National Association or any other LC Issuer assigns all of its Commitments and Loans pursuant to subsection (b) above, (i) U.S. Bank National Association or any other LC Issuer may, upon 30 days’ notice to the Borrower and the Lenders, resign as LC Issuer and/or (ii) U.S. Bank National Association or any other Swing Line Lender may, upon 30 days’ notice to the Borrower, resign as Swing Line Lender.  In the event of any such resignation as LC Issuer or Swing Line Lender, the Borrower shall be entitled to appoint from among the Lenders a successor LC Issuer or Swing Line Lender hereunder; provided, however, that no failure by the Borrower to appoint any such successor shall affect the resignation of such LC Issuer or Swing Line Lender, as the case may be.  If U.S. Bank National Association resigns as LC Issuer, it shall retain all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the LC Issuer hereunder with respect to all Facility LCs outstanding as of the effective time of its resignation as LC Issuer and all LC Obligations with respect thereto (including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Loans or fund risk participations pursuant to Section 2.19(b)).  If U.S. Bank National Association resigns as Swing Line Lender, it shall retain all the rights of the Swing Line Lender provided for hereunder with respect to Swing Line Loans made by it and outstanding as of the effective time of such resignation, including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Loans or fund risk participations in outstanding Swing Line Loans pursuant to Section 2.4(d).  Upon the appointment of a successor LC Issuer and/or Swing Line Lender, (a) such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring LC Issuer or Swing Line Lender, as the case may be, and (b) the successor LC Issuer shall issue letters of credit in substitution for the Facility LCs, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession or make other arrangements satisfactory to such LC Issuer to effectively assume the obligations of such LC Issuer with respect to such Facility LCs.ARTICLE XIIINOTICES13.1.    Notices; Effectiveness; Electronic Communication.(a)    Notices Generally.
