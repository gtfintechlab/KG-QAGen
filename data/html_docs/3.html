Each Lender expressly acknowledges that none of the Administrative Agent, any Arranger or the Syndication Agent has made any
representation or warranty to it, and that no act by the Administrative Agent, any Arranger or the Syndication Agent hereafter
taken, including any consent to, and acceptance of any assignment or review of the affairs of any Loan Party of any Affiliate
thereof, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by the Administrative Agent, any Arranger or the Syndication
Agent to any Lender as to any matter, including whether the Administrative Agent, any Arranger or the Syndication Agent have
disclosed material information in their (or their Related Parties’) possession. Each Lender represents to the Administrative
Agent, the Arrangers and the Syndication Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, the
Arrangers, the Syndication Agent, any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it
has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis of, appraisal of, and investigation into, the business, prospects, operations,
property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Loan Parties and their Subsidiaries, and all applicable bank or
other regulatory laws relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, and made its own decision to enter into this Agreement and
to extend credit to the Borrowers hereunder. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative Agent, any Arranger, the Syndication Agent, any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such
documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and
decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any
document furnished hereunder or thereunder, and to make such investigations as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the
business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Loan Parties. Each Lender
represents and warrants that (i) the Loan Documents set forth the terms of a commercial lending facility and (ii) it is
engaged in making, acquiring or holding commercial loans in the ordinary course and is entering into this Agreement as a Lender for
the purpose of making, acquiring or holding commercial loans and providing other facilities set forth herein as may be applicable to
such Lender, and not for the purpose of purchasing, acquiring or holding any other type of financial instrument, and each Lender
agrees not to assert a claim in contravention of the foregoing. Each Lender represents and warrants that it is sophisticated with
respect to decisions to make, acquire and/or hold commercial loans and to provide other facilities set forth herein, as may be
applicable to such Lender, and either it, or the Person exercising discretion in making its decision to make, acquire and/or hold
such commercial loans or to provide such other facilities, is experienced in making, acquiring or holding such commercial loans or
providing such other facilities.</p>
