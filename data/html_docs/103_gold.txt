The Credits  SECTION
2.01    Commitments. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, each Lender agrees to make a Loan in Dollars to the Borrowers on the Closing Date in an amount equal to such Lenders Commitment.
Once repaid, the Term Loan may not be reborrowed. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan required to be made by it shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligations hereunder; provided, that the Commitments of the Lenders are several
and no Lender shall be responsible for any other Lenders failure to make Loans as required.  SECTION
2.02    [Reserved]. 
  39 


SECTION 2.03    [Reserved]. 
SECTION 2.04    Procedure for Borrowing. On the Closing Date, each Lender shall make available to the account of
the Administrative Agent, an amount in immediately available funds equal to its Commitment. Upon receipt of the funds to be made available by the Lenders, the Administrative Agent shall disburse such funds by depositing the requested amounts into
the account(s) specified by Holdings to the Administrative Agent.  SECTION 2.05    [Reserved]. 
SECTION 2.06    [Reserved]. 
SECTION 2.07    [Reserved]. 
SECTION 2.08    [Reserved]. 
SECTION 2.09    Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt. 
(a)    Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness
of the Borrowers to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder. 
(b)    The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made
hereunder, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrowers to each Lender hereunder and (iii) any amount received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the
Lenders and each Lenders share thereof.  (c)    The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to
paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided, that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any
error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrowers to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. 
(d)    Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by a Note. In such event, each Borrower shall prepare,
execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to the order of such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) and in substantially the form of Exhibit C. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced
by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 9.04) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named therein (or, if such
promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns).  (e)    The outstanding unpaid
principal balance and all accrued and unpaid interest on the Loans shall be due and payable on the Maturity Date. 
  40 


SECTION 2.10    Fees. The Borrowers shall pay to the Collateral Agent,
for its own account, the fees described in the Collateral Agent Fee Letter, on the terms, in the amount and at the times set forth therein. 
SECTION 2.11    Prepayment of Loans. 
(a)    Immediately upon any Asset Sale by Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to Section 6.05 (a), (f) or
(i), but, if applicable, subject to the reinvestment right set out in clause (d) below, the Borrowers shall prepay the outstanding principal amount of the Loans in an amount equal to 100% of the Net Cash Proceeds received by Holdings or such
Subsidiary in connection with such Asset Sale to the extent that the aggregate amount of such Net Cash Proceeds received by all Loan Parties and the Subsidiaries (and not otherwise paid to the Administrative Agent as a prepayment of the Loans) shall
exceed, for all such Asset Sales in any fiscal year of the Borrowers, $5,000,000.  (b)    Upon the issuance or
incurrence by Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries of any Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness permitted pursuant to Section 6.01), the Borrowers shall prepay the outstanding amount of the Loans in an amount equal to 100% of the Net Cash
Proceeds received by such Person in connection therewith.  (c)    Upon the receipt by Holdings or any of its
Subsidiaries of any Extraordinary Receipts, but subject to the reinvestment right set out in clause (d) below, the Borrowers shall prepay the outstanding principal amount of the Loans in an amount equal to 100% of the Net Cash Proceeds received
by Holdings or such Subsidiary, in connection with such Extraordinary Receipt to the extent that the aggregate amount of the Net Cash Proceeds received by all Loan Parties and the Subsidiaries (and not otherwise paid to the Administrative Agent as a
prepayment of the Loans) shall exceed, for all such Extraordinary Receipts in any fiscal year of Holdings and the Subsidiaries, $5,000,000. 
(d)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with the receipt of Net Cash Proceeds from (A) Extraordinary
Receipts and (B) Asset Sales pursuant to Section 6.05(f) or (i) (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not Section 6.05(a)), such Net Cash Proceeds shall not be required to be applied to the prepayment of the Loans on such date to the extent
Holdings notifies the Administrative Agent promptly following receipt of any such proceeds setting forth the Borrowers intention to use any portion of such proceeds, within 365 days of such receipt, to acquire, maintain, develop, construct,
improve, upgrade or repair assets useful in the business of the Subsidiaries (and with respect to Net Cash Proceeds received by a Loan Party, useful in the business of such Loan Party) or to make Permitted Business Acquisitions and other Investments
permitted hereunder (excluding Permitted Investments or intercompany Investments in Subsidiaries) or to reimburse the cost of any of the foregoing incurred on or after the date on which the Asset Sale or Extraordinary Receipt giving rise to such
proceeds was contractually committed, such portion of such proceeds shall not constitute Net Cash Proceeds except to the extent not, within 365 days of such receipt, so used or contractually committed to be so used (it being understood that if any
portion of such proceeds are not so used within such 365 days period but within such 365 days period are contractually committed to be used, then such remaining portion if not so used within 180 days following the end of such 365 days period shall
constitute Net Cash Proceeds as of such date without giving effect to this proviso). 
  41 


(e)    The Borrowers shall have the right at any time and from time to time
to prepay the Loans in whole or in part, in an aggregate principal amount that is an integral multiple of $500,000 and not less than $1,000,000. 
(f)    Prior to any prepayment of the Loans, Holdings shall notify the Administrative Agent in writing not later than
2:00 p.m., Local Time, one (1) Business Day before the scheduled date of such prepayment, which notice shall be irrevocable except to the extent conditioned on a refinancing of all or any portion of the Loans. Each prepayment of Loans
shall be applied to the Loans such that each Lender receives its ratable share of such prepayment (based upon the respective Loans held by the Lenders at the time of such prepayment). Prepayments of Loans shall be accompanied by accrued interest on
the amount repaid and, as liquidated damages and compensation for the costs of makeup funds available hereunder solely with respect to prepayments of Loans pursuant to Sections 2.11(b) and 2.11(e), the Applicable Prepayment Premium. The Borrowers
agree that the amount of the Applicable Prepayment Premium is a reasonable calculation of the Lenders lost profits in view of the difficulties and impracticalities of determining actual damages resulting from an early prepayment of the Loans.
 SECTION 2.12    Additional Interest. The Borrowers agree to pay additional interest to each Lender until the
first anniversary of the Closing Date (the Additional Interest) in an aggregate amount equal to 3.00% per annum of the aggregate principal amount of such Lenders ratable share of Loans outstanding as of the Closing Date. The
Additional Interest shall be paid as capitalized interest quarterly to the Lenders (in quarterly amounts equal to 0.75% of the aggregate principal amount of such Lenders ratable share of Loans outstanding as of the Closing Date) and added to
the principal balance of the Loans on the Interest Payment Dates occurring on April 15, 2017, July 15, 2017, October 15, 2017 and January 15, 2018. 
SECTION 2.13    Interest. 
(a)    The Loans shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to 12.00% per annum. Accrued interest on the Loans shall be
payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date, commencing with the Interest Payment Date occurring on April 15, 2017, and upon the Maturity Date; provided, that (x) interest accrued pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section shall
be payable on demand and (y) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan, accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment. 
(b)    Automatically and for so long as any Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing under Section 7.01(b),
(c), (h) or (i) (or at the election, after notice to Holdings, of the Administrative Agent or Required Lenders for so long as any other Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing) (i) all Loans shall bear interest after as well as
before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to 2% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in the preceding paragraph of this Section or (ii) in the case of any other amount 
  42 



(including, but not limited to, fees to be paid under the Loan Documents), such amount shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to 2% plus the rate applicable to Loans as provided in
paragraph (a) of this Section.  (c)    All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365
days or 366, as applicable, and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). 
(d)    Minimum Interest. 
(i)    By entering into this Agreement, the Parties have assumed in good faith that the interest payable
hereunder is not and will not become subject to any deduction on account of Swiss Withholding

 Swiss Withholding Tax on the interest so recalculated and remit such amount to the applicable Governmental Authority; and 
(c)    all references to a rate of interest payable by a Swiss Obligor in respect of each relevant Loan
shall be construed accordingly.  SECTION 2.14    [Reserved]. 
SECTION 2.15    [Reserved]. 
SECTION 2.16    [Reserved].  
SECTION 2.17    Taxes. 
(a)    Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be made free
and clear of and without deduction for any Taxes, except where required by applicable law. If any applicable withholding agent shall be 
  43 



required by applicable law to deduct any Taxes from such payments, then (i) to the extent the deduction is an account of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, the sum payable by the Loan Parties
shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.17) the Administrative Agent or any Lender, as applicable, receives an amount equal to
the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the applicable withholding agent shall make such deductions and (iii) the applicable withholding agent shall timely pay the full amount deducted to the relevant
Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.  (b)    In addition, the Loan Parties shall timely pay any
Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.  (c)    Each Loan Party shall
indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender within 10 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes payable by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as applicable, on or with respect to any payment by or
on account of any obligation of such Loan Party under any Loan Document and any Other Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 2.17 and Section
2.13(d)(i)(b)(ii)) and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to
the amount of such payment or liability delivered to such Loan Party by a Lender, or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf, on behalf of another Agent or on behalf of a Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
(d)    As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by a Loan Party to a Governmental
Authority and as soon as practicable following the making of any payment pursuant to Section 2.13(d)(i)(b)(ii), such Loan Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental
Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. 
(e)    Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax or backup withholding Tax with
respect to payments under any Loan Document shall deliver to Holdings (with a copy to the Agents), to the extent such Lender is legally eligible to do so, at the time or times prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and executed
documentation prescribed by applicable law, or as may reasonably be requested by Holdings or the Administrative Agent to permit such payments to be made without such withholding tax or at a reduced rate. In addition, each Lender shall deliver such
forms, if legally eligible to deliver such forms, promptly upon the obsolescence, expiration or invalidity of any form previously delivered by such Lender. Each Lender shall promptly notify Holdings and the Administrative Agent at any time it
determines that it is no longer in a position to provide any previously delivered certificate (or any other form of certification adopted by the United States of America or other taxing authorities for such purpose). 
  44 


(f)    Without limiting the generality of Section 2.17(e) above: 
(A)    If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject withholding Tax imposed by
FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to Holdings and the Agents at the time or
times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by Holdings or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional
documentation reasonably requested by Holdings or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for Holdings and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such
Lenders obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this Section 2.17(f), FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
 (B)    Each Lender that is a United States Person shall deliver to Holdings and the Administrative
Agent two executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 (or any subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto) on or before the date such Lender becomes a party and upon the expiration of any
form previously delivered by such Lender.  (C)    Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Section 2.17, a Lender shall not be required to deliver any form pursuant to this paragraph that such Lender is not legally eligible to deliver. 
(g)    If the Agents or Lender has received a refund (in cash or as an offset against other Taxes payable) of any
Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by any Loan Party or with respect to which a Loan Party has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.17 or pursuant to Section 2.13(d)(i)(b)(ii), it shall pay over
such refund to such Loan Party (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such Loan Party under this Section 2.17 or pursuant to Section 2.13(d)(i)(b)(ii)with respect to the Indemnified Taxes or Other
Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out of pocket expenses of the Agents, such Lender (including any Taxes imposed with respect to such refund) as is determined by the Administrative Agent, such Lender in good faith and in its sole
discretion, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); provided, that such Loan Party, upon the request of the Administrative Agent, such Lender, agrees to repay as
soon as reasonably practicable the amount paid over to such Loan Party (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent, such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent,
such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This Section 2.17 shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its
Taxes which it deems in good faith to be confidential) to the Loan Parties or any other person.  (h)    Any payments
by any Loan Party under any Loan Document which (in whole or in part) constitute consideration for a supply or otherwise serve for VAT purposes shall 
  45 



be deemed to be exclusive of any VAT which is chargeable in connection therewith. If, in connection with any payments by any Loan Party under any Loan Document, VAT is chargeable to the Lender,
such Loan Party shall promptly pay to the Lender, an amount equal to the amount of such VAT (and the Lender shall, promptly following a request therefore by the Borrower, provide an appropriate VAT invoice to the Borrower). For the avoidance of
doubt and without duplication, where any Loan Party is required under any Loan Document to reimburse the Lender for any costs or expenses, that Loan Party shall also at the same time pay and indemnify the Lender against all VAT and any stamp duty,
registration or other similar tax payables, in each case incurred in connection with the entry into, performance or enforcement of any Loan Document. 
SECTION 2.18    Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Setoffs. 
(a)    Unless otherwise specified, the Borrowers shall make each payment required to be made by them hereunder (whether of
principal, interest, fees, or of amounts payable under Section 2.17, or otherwise) prior to 2:00 p.m., Local Time. The Borrowers shall make each such payment on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without condition or deduction
for any defense, recoupment, set off or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of
calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, to the applicable account designated to Holdings by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as applicable,
except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.17 and 9.05 shall be made directly to the persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other person to the appropriate
recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, then unless otherwise provided with respect to such payment, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding
Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments under the Loan Documents shall be made in Dollars. Any payment required to be made by the
Administrative Agent hereunder shall be deemed to have been made by the time required if the Administrative Agent shall, at or before such time, have taken the necessary steps to make such payment in accordance with the regulations or operating
procedures of the clearing or settlement system used by the Administrative Agent to make such payment.  (b)    If at
any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent from the Borrowers to pay fully all amounts of principal, interest and fees then due from the Borrowers hereunder, such funds shall be applied first, to all fees
and expenses then due and payable to the Agents, second, to all fees and expenses then due and payable to the Lenders, third, to accrued and unpaid interest on the Loans until paid in full, fourth, to the aggregate outstanding principal amount of
the Loans until paid in full, fifth, to all other outstanding Obligations until paid in full, and sixth, to the Borrowers or otherwise in accordance with applicable law. 
  46 


(c)    If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set off or
counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and accrued interest thereon than the
proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be
shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans; provided, that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment
giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph (c) shall not be construed to apply to any
payment made by the Borrowers pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or
participant, other than to any Loan Party or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph (c) shall apply). Each Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under
applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Borrower rights of set off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct
creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation.  (d)    [Reserved]. 
(e)    If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.18(d), then the
Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lenders obligations under such
Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.  SECTION 2.19    Mitigation Obligations;
Replacement of Lenders.  (a)    If any Loan Party is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any
Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender with respect to Indemnified Taxes pursuant to Section 2.17, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or
to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or Affiliates, if, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to
Section 2.17 in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender in any material respect. The Borrowers hereby agree to pay all
reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.  (b)    If
the Loan Parties are required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender with respect to Indemnified Taxes pursuant to Section 2.17, then the Borrowers may, at their sole expense and
effort, upon notice by Holdings to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such 
  47 



Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement
to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided, that (i) Holdings shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, which
consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued interest thereon, Applicable Prepayment Premium accrued fees and all other amounts
payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Loan Parties (in the case of all other amounts including, without limitation, the Applicable Prepayment Premium) and
(iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for payments required to be made with respect to Indemnified Taxes pursuant to Section 2.17, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments. 
(c)    If any Lender (such Lender, a Non-Consenting Lender) has
failed to consent to a proposed amendment, waiver, discharge or termination which pursuant to the terms of Section 9.08 requires the consent of all of the Lenders affected and with respect to which the Required Lenders shall have granted their
consent, then the Borrowers shall have the right (unless such Non-Consenting Lender grants such consent) at their sole expense (including with respect to the processing and recordation fee referred to in
Section 9.04(b)(ii)(B)) to replace such Non-Consenting Lender by deeming such Non-Consenting Lender to have assigned its Loans to one or more assignees reasonably
acceptable to the Administrative Agent; provided, that: (a) all Obligations of the Borrowers owing to such Non-Consenting Lender being replaced including, without limitation, any Applicable
Prepayment Premiums, fees and expenses, shall be paid in full to such Non-Consenting Lender concurrently with such assignment and (b) the replacement Lender shall purchase the foregoing by paying to such Non-Consenting Lender a price equal to the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon. No action by or consent of the Non-Consenting Lender shall be
necessary in connection with such assignment, which shall be immediately and automatically effective upon payment of such purchase price. In connection with any such assignment, the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent, such Non-Consenting Lender and the replacement Lender shall otherwise comply with Section 9.04; provided, that if such Non-Consenting Lender does not comply with
Section 9.04 within three Business Days after Borrower Representatives request, compliance with Section 9.04 shall not be required to effect such assignment.

or different times: (i) declare the Loans then outstanding to be forthwith due and payable in whole or in part, whereupon the principal of the Loans so declared to be due and payable, together with accrued interest thereon the Applicable
Prepayment Premium and any unpaid accrued Fees and all other liabilities of the Loan Parties accrued hereunder and under any other Loan Document, shall become forthwith due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or any other notice of any
kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the 
  86 



Borrowers, anything contained herein or in any other Loan Document to the contrary notwithstanding; and in any event described in paragraph (h) or (i) above, the principal of the Loans then
outstanding, together with accrued interest thereon the Applicable Prepayment Premium and any unpaid accrued Fees and all other liabilities of the Borrowers accrued hereunder and under any other Loan Document, shall automatically become due and
payable, without presentment, demand, protest or any other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the Borrowers, anything contained herein or in any other Loan Document to the contrary notwithstanding. 
SECTION 7.02 Acceleration. 
(a)    Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that if the Loans are accelerated or
otherwise become due prior to the Final Maturity Date, in each case, in respect of any Event of Default (including, but not limited to, upon the occurrence of a bankruptcy or insolvency event (including the acceleration of claims by operation of
law)), the Applicable Prepayment Premium with respect to a prepayment of the Loans will also be due and payable, in cash, as though the Loans were prepaid pursuant to Section 2.11 and shall constitute part of the Obligations, in view of the
impracticability and extreme difficulty of ascertaining actual damages and by mutual agreement of the parties as to a reasonable calculation of each Lenders lost profits as a result thereof. The Applicable Prepayment Premium payable above
shall be presumed to be the liquidated damages sustained by each Lender as the result of the early prepayment and the Borrowers agree that it is reasonable under the circumstances currently existing. 
(b)    The Applicable Prepayment Premium shall also be payable in the event the Obligations are satisfied or released by
foreclosure (whether by power of judicial proceeding), deed in lieu of foreclosure or by any other means. THE BORROWERS EXPRESSLY WAIVE (TO THE FULLEST EXTENT THEY MAY LAWFULLY DO SO) THE PROVISIONS OF ANY PRESENT OR FUTURE STATUTE OR LAW THAT
PROHIBITS OR MAY PROHIBIT THE COLLECTION OF THE APPLICABLE PREPAYMENT PREMIUM IN CONNECTION WITH ANY SUCH ACCELERATION. The Borrowers expressly agree (to the fullest extent it may lawfully do so) that: (i) the Applicable Prepayment Premium is
reasonable and is the product of an arms length transaction between sophisticated business people, ably represented by counsel; (ii) the Applicable Prepayment Premium shall be payable notwithstanding the then prevailing market rates at
the time payment is made; (iii) there has been a course of conduct between the Lenders and the Borrowers giving specific consideration in this transaction for such agreement to pay the Applicable Prepayment Premium; and (iv) the Borrowers
shall be estopped hereafter from claiming differently than as agreed to in this paragraph. The Borrowers expressly acknowledge that their agreement to pay the Applicable Prepayment Premium to the Lenders as herein described is a material inducement
to the Lenders to make the Loans.  SECTION 7.03 Exclusion of Immaterial Subsidiaries. Solely for the purposes of determining
whether an Event of Default has occurred under clause (h), (i) or (j) of Section 7.01, any reference in any such clause to any Subsidiary shall be deemed not to include any Immaterial Subsidiary affected by any event or circumstance
referred to in any such clause.

adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding relative to the Borrowers, (i) the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Obligation shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or
otherwise and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrowers) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise (A) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of
the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of any or all of the Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders and the Administrative

official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, if the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders, to pay to the
Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and their respective agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Administrative Agent
or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, under the Loan Documents. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender any plan of reorganization,

Loan Document to any Secured Party is hereby authorized to make such payment to the Administrative Agent, (B) file and prove claims and file other documents necessary or desirable to allow the claims of the Secured Parties with respect to any
Obligation in any proceeding described in Section 7.01(h) or (i) or any other bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceeding (but not to vote, consent or otherwise act on behalf of such Secured Party), (C) except as may be otherwise specified in
any Loan Document, exercise all remedies given to the Administrative Agent and/or the Collateral Agent and the other Secured Parties with respect to the Collateral, whether under the Loan Documents, applicable requirements of law or otherwise and

but shall be required to act or to refrain from acing (and shall be fully protected in so acting or refraining from acting) upon the instructions of the Required Lenders, and such instructions shall be binding upon all Lenders and all holders of
Notes; provided, however, that the Collateral Agent shall not be required to take any action that exposes it to personal liability or that is, in the opinion of the Collateral Agent or its counsel, contrary to any Loan Document or applicable
law.

(e)    Swiss Collateral. 
(i)    In relation to any Swiss Collateral Document under which security of an accessory
(akzessorische) nature is granted (including, without limitation, the Swiss Account Pledge Agreement and the Swiss Share Pledge Agreement) each present and future Lender hereby appoints and authorizes the Collateral Agent to do all acts in
the name and for the account of such Lender as its direct representative (direkter Stellvertreter), including, without limitation, (i) to accept and execute and hold, administer and, if necessary, enforce the security granted under any
such Swiss Collateral Documents, (ii) to agree to amendments, restatements and other alterations of such Swiss Collateral Documents, (iii) to effect any release of the security under, and the termination of, any such Swiss Collateral

transactions for its own accounts.  (f)    German Collateral. 
(i)    Each of the Secured Parties (other than the Collateral Agent) hereby appoints the Collateral Agent

and declarations previously done by the Collateral Agent on such Secured Partys behalf.

performance of all duties and obligations of the Collateral Agent under this Agreement and under or in connection with the Security Documents, the Collateral Agent shall be released by each Secured Party (to the extent legally possible) from any
restrictions on representing several persons and self-dealing under any applicable law, and in particular from the restrictions of Section 181 of the German Civil Code (Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch). 
(g)    French Collateral. 
(i)    Each Secured Party (other than the Collateral Agent) (as mandant):

Agreement under or in connection with the French Security Documents, including, if need be, the appointment of a custodian which shall hold assets on its behalf (including, as may be the case, share certificates or share registries relating to
shares in the capital of any debtor) in custody under any French Security Document, and the Collateral Agent accepts such appointment; 
(b)    confirms its approval of the French Security Documents creating or expressed to create French
Transaction Security benefiting it and any French Transaction Security created or to be created pursuant thereto and irrevocably authorizes (with power of delegation), empowers and directs the Collateral Agent (by itself or by such person(s) as it
may nominate) to execute and deliver for and on its behalf each French Security Document, to perform the duties and to exercise the rights, powers and discretions that are specifically delegated to the Collateral Agent or any Secured Party under or
in connection with the French Security Documents, together with any other rights, powers and discretions which are incidental thereto and to give a good discharge for any moneys payable under the Security Documents; and 
(c)    acknowledges that the Collateral Agent has been appointed by it to constitute, register, manage and
enforce all French Transaction Security created in its favour by any French Security Documents, and agrees that the French Transaction Security to its nomination in accordance with applicable law from time to time. 
(ii)    The Collateral Agent will act solely for itself (as Secured Party) and as agent for the other
Secured Parties in carrying out its functions as collateral agent under the relevant French Security Documents and this Agreement. 
  91 


(iii)    In relation to French Security Documents, the
relationship between the Secured Parties (other than the Collateral Agent) and the Collateral Agent is that of principal and agent only. The Collateral Agent shall not have, or be deemed to have, assumed any obligations to or fiduciary relationship
with, any Party other than those for which specific provision is made by the French Security Documents and this Agreement. 
(iv)    The Collateral Agent shall not be liable to any person for any breach by any Secured Party of this
Agreement or be liable to any Secured Party for any breach by any other person of this Agreement or any other Debt Document. 
(v)    In furtherance of this Section 8.01, each of the Secured Parties hereby undertakes to the
Collateral Agent that, promptly upon request, such Secured Party will ratify and confirm all transactions entered into and other actions by the Collateral Agent (or any of its substitutes or delegates) in the proper exercise of the power granted to
it hereunder.  SECTION 8.02    Delegation of Duties. Each Agent may execute any of its duties under this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents by or through agents, employees or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel and other consultants or experts
concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. Neither the Administrative Agent nor the Collateral Agent shall be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agents or
attorneys-in-fact selected by it with reasonable care. 
SECTION 8.03    Exculpatory Provisions. Neither any Agent or its Affiliates nor any of their respective officers,
directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates shall be (a) liable for any action lawfully taken or omitted to be taken by it or such person under or
in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document (except to the extent that any of the foregoing are found by a final and nonappealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from its or such persons own
gross negligence or willful misconduct) or (b) responsible in any manner to any of the Lenders for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by the Borrowers or any officer thereof contained in this Agreement or any other
Loan Document or in any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by any Agent under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other Loan Document or for the value, validity, effectiveness,
genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or for any failure of the Borrowers to perform their obligations hereunder or thereunder. Neither the Administrative Agent nor the Collateral Agent shall be
under any obligation to any Lender to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or to inspect the properties, books or records of
the Borrowers. Neither the Administrative Agent nor the Collateral Agent shall have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) neither
the Administrative Agent nor the Collateral Agent shall be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, and (b) neither the Administrative Agent nor the
Collateral Agent shall, except as expressly set forth 
  92 



herein and in the other Loan Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to any Borrower or any of its Affiliates that is
communicated to or obtained by the person serving as the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any of their respective Affiliates in any capacity. Neither the Administrative Agent nor the Collateral Agent shall be deemed to have knowledge of
any Default or Event of Default unless and until notice describing such Default or Event of Default is given to the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, in writing by Holdings, or a Lender. Neither the Administrative Agent
nor the Collateral Agent shall be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any
certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or

of any Lien purported to be created by the Security Documents, (v) the value or sufficiency of the Collateral or (vi) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items
expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as applicable.  SECTION
8.04    Reliance by Agents. Each of the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent,
statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) or conversation believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by
the proper person. Each of the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper person, and shall not incur any liability for relying
thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the Closing Date, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender, the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent may presume that such condition is
satisfactory to such Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender prior to the Closing Date. Any Agent may consult with legal counsel (including counsel to the Borrowers), independent accountants
and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts. The Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent may deem and treat the
payee of any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes unless a written notice of assignment, negotiation or transfer thereof shall have been filed with the Administrative Agent. Each of the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent shall be
fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement or any other Loan Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all or other Lenders)
as it deems appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense that may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. Each of the Administrative
Agent and the Collateral Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement and the other Loan 
  93 



Documents in accordance with a request of the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all or other Lenders), and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant
thereto shall be binding upon all the Lenders and all future holders of the Loans. The Collateral Agent may rely upon the last provided Register in making a determination with respect to the Required Lenders. 
SECTION 8.05    Notice of Default. Neither the Administrative Agent nor the Collateral Agent shall be deemed to
have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default unless the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, has received written notice from a Lender or Holdings referring to this Agreement, describing such
Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a notice of default. In the event that the Administrative Agent receives such a notice, the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Lenders. Each of the
Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be reasonably directed by the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all or other Lenders); provided,
that unless and until the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, shall have received such directions, each of the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain
from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interests of the Lenders. 
SECTION 8.06    Non-Reliance on Agents and Other Lenders. Each Lender
expressly acknowledges that neither the Agents nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates have made any
representations or warranties to it and that no act by any Agent hereafter taken, including any review of the affairs of the Loan Parties or any affiliate of the Loan Parties, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by any Agent
to any Lender. Each Lender represents to the Agents that it has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of, and
investigation into, the business, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Loan Parties and their affiliates and made its own decision to make its Loans hereunder and enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also
represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions
in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of
the Loan Parties and their affiliates. Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to
provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, operations, property, condition (financial or otherwise), prospects or creditworthiness of any Loan Party or any affiliate of any Loan Party that may come into the
possession of the Administrative Agent or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates. 
  94 


SECTION 8.07    Indemnification. The Lenders agree to indemnify each
Agent in its capacity as such (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrowers and without limiting the obligation of the Borrowers to do so), in the amount of its pro rata share (based on its Loans hereunder) (determined at the time such indemnity is
sought), from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever that may at any time (whether before or after the payment of the Loans) be
imposed on, incurred by or asserted against such Agent in any way relating to or arising out this Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents or any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby or any action taken or omitted by such Agent under or in connection with any of the foregoing; provided, that no Lender shall be liable for the payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements that are found by a final and nonappealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such Agents gross negligence or willful misconduct. The failure of any
Lender to reimburse any Agent promptly upon demand for its ratable share of any amount required to be paid by the Lenders to such Agent as provided herein shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation hereunder to reimburse such Agent for its
ratable share of such amount, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to reimburse such Agent for such other Lenders ratable share of such amount. The agreements in this Section shall survive the payment of the
Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.  SECTION 8.08    Agent in Its Individual Capacity. Each Agent
and its affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from, and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrowers as though such Agent were not an Agent. With respect to its Loans made or renewed by it, each Agent shall have the same
rights and powers under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as any Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not an Agent, and the terms Lender and Lenders shall include each Agent in its individual capacity.
 SECTION 8.09    Successor Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may resign as Administrative Agent
upon 10 days notice to the Lenders and Holdings. If the Administrative Agent shall resign as Administrative Agent under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, then the Required Lenders shall appoint from among the Lenders a successor
agent for the Lenders, which successor agent shall (unless an Event of Default under Section 7.01(b), (c), (h) or (i) shall have occurred and be continuing) be subject to approval by Holdings (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed), whereupon such successor agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of the Administrative Agent, and the term Administrative Agent shall mean such successor agent effective upon such appointment and approval, and
the former Administrative Agents rights, powers and duties as Administrative Agent shall be terminated, without any other or further act or deed on the part of such former Administrative Agent or any of the parties to this Agreement or any
holders of the Loans. If no successor agent has accepted appointment as Administrative Agent by the date that is 10 days following a retiring Administrative Agents notice of resignation, the retiring Administrative Agents resignation
shall nevertheless thereupon become effective, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor agent which shall (unless an Event of Default under Section 7.01(b), (c), (h) or (i) shall have occurred
and be 
  95 



continuing) be subject to approval by Holdings (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). After any retiring Administrative Agents resignation as Administrative Agent,
the provisions of this Section 8.09 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. The foregoing provisions shall also be
applicable with respect to the resignation of the Collateral Agent and appointment of any successor Collateral Agent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon any assignment of the Loans by the Initial Lender to any person other than an Affiliate or
Approved Fund of the Initial Lender who becomes a Lender hereunder pursuant to Section 9.04, the Initial Lender may on or prior to the effectiveness of such assignment, appoint any person as a successor agent (who may be any of the Collateral
Agent, a Lender or such other person reasonably acceptable to the Initial Lender and, unless an Event of Default under Section 7.01(b), (c), (h) or (i) shall have occurred and be continuing, Holdings), whereupon such successor agent shall
succeed to the rights, powers and duties of the Administrative Agent and the term Administrative Agent shall mean such successor agent effective upon such appointment and approval, and the Initial Lenders rights, powers and duties
as Administrative Agent shall be terminated, without any other or further act or deed on the part of the Initial Lender or any of the parties to this Agreement or any holders of the Loans. 
SECTION 8.10    Parallel Debt. Notwithstanding any other provision of any Loan Document, each Guarantor organized
in any jurisdiction listed in Schedule 8.10 (as such schedule may be amended or supplemented from time to time by mutual agreement of the Administrative Agent and the Company) (each, a Relevant Loan Party), hereby
unconditionally and irrevocably agrees and covenants with the Collateral Agent by way of an acknowledgement of independent payment obligation that such Relevant Loan Party shall pay to the Collateral Agent as creditor in its own right and not as
representative or agent of the other Secured Parties sums equal to, and in the currency of, the aggregate amount of the obligations owing by such Relevant Loan Party under the Loan Documents at any given time (the Principal
Obligations) as and when the same fall due for payment under the Loan Documents (the aforesaid sums being the Parallel Obligations). 
The Collateral Agent shall have its own independent right to demand payment of the Parallel Obligations from the Relevant Loan Party (such
demand to be made in accordance with, and only in the circumstances permitted under the Loan Documents). The rights of the Secured Parties (other than the Collateral Agent) to receive payment of the Principal Obligations are several, separate and
independent from the rights of the Collateral Agent to receive payment of the Parallel Obligations and shall not in any way limit or affect each Relevant Loan Partys Principal Obligations nor shall the amounts for which each Relevant Loan
Party is liable under it Parallel Obligations be limited or affected in any way by its Principal Obligations provided that the payment by the Relevant Loan Party of its Parallel Obligations to the Collateral Agent in accordance with this
Section 8.10 shall be an effective discharge of the corresponding Principal Obligations and the payment by the Relevant Loan Party of its Principal Obligations in accordance with the provisions of the Loan Documents shall be an effective
discharge of the corresponding Parallel Obligations. 
  96 


In the event of an effective discharge of any Principal Obligations, the Collateral Agent shall
not be entitled to demand payment of the corresponding Parallel Obligations and such Parallel Obligations shall be discharged to the same extent. In the event of an effective discharge of any Parallel Obligations the Loan Parties shall not be
entitled to demand payment of the corresponding Principal Obligations and such Principal Obligations shall be discharged to the same extent. In the event of any conflict between the provisions contained in this Section 8.10 and
Section 9.22 hereof, this Section 8.10 shall control.  The Collateral Agent acts in its own name and not as trustee and it shall
have its own independent right to demand payment of the amounts payable by each Relevant Loan Party pursuant to the Parallel Obligations. 
SECTION 8.11    Withholding Taxes. To the extent required by any applicable laws, the Administrative Agent may
withhold from any payment to any Lender an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding Tax. Without limiting or expanding the provisions of Section 2.09, each Lender shall indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative Agent against, within
10 days after written demand therefor, any and all Taxes and any and all related losses, claims, liabilities and expenses (including fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for the Administrative Agent) incurred by or asserted against the
Administrative Agent by the Internal Revenue Service or any other Governmental Authority as a result of the failure of the Administrative Agent to properly withhold Tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender for any reason (including,
without limitation, because the appropriate form was not delivered or not properly executed, or because such Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in circumstance that rendered the exemption from, or reduction of, withholding
Tax ineffective). A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply
any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any amount due the Administrative Agent under this Section 8.11. The agreements in this Section 8.11 shall survive the resignation
and/or replacement of the Administrative Agent, any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other Obligations.

foregoing shall not apply to notices to any Lender pursuant to Article II if such Lender, as applicable, has notified the Administrative Agent that it is incapable of receiving notices under such Article by electronic communication. The
Administrative Agent or Holdings may, in its discretion, agree to accept notices and other communications to it hereunder by electronic communications pursuant to procedures approved by it, provided that approval of such procedures may be
limited to particular notices or communications.  (c)    Notices sent by hand or overnight courier service, or mailed
by certified or registered mail, shall be deemed to have been given when received. Notices sent by telecopier shall be deemed to have been given when sent (except that, if not given during normal business hours for the recipient, shall be deemed to

any such documents are included in materials otherwise filed with the SEC) may be delivered electronically (including as set forth in Section 9.17) and if so delivered, shall be deemed to have been delivered on the date (i) on which
Holdings posts such documents, or provides a link thereto on Holdingss website on the Internet at the website address listed on Schedule 9.01, or (ii) on which such documents are posted on Holdingss behalf on an Internet or
intranet website, if any, to which each Lender and the Agents have access (whether a commercial, third-party website or whether sponsored by the Administrative Agent); provided, that (A) Holdings shall

  98 



deliver paper copies of such documents to the Agents or any Lender that requests Holdings to deliver such paper copies until a written request to cease delivering paper copies is given by the
applicable Agent or such Lender, and (B) Holdings shall notify the Agents and each Lender (by telecopier or electronic mail) of the posting of any such documents and provide to the Agents by electronic mail electronic versions (i.e., soft
copies) of such documents. Notwithstanding anything contained herein, in every instance Holdings shall be required to provide paper copies of the certificates required by Section 5.04(c) to the Administrative Agent. Except for such certificates
required by Section 5.04(c), the Administrative Agent shall have no obligation to request the delivery or to maintain copies of the documents referred to above, and in any event shall have no responsibility to monitor compliance by Holdings with any
such request for delivery, and each Lender shall be solely responsible for requesting delivery to it or maintaining its copies of such documents. 
SECTION 9.02    Survival of Agreement. All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the Loan
Parties herein, in the other Loan Documents and in the certificates or other instruments prepared or delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be considered to have been relied upon by the Lenders
and shall survive the making by the Lenders of the Loans and the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents, regardless of any investigation made by such persons or on their behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent may have had
notice or knowledge of any Default or Event of Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any Loan is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or
any Fee or any other amount payable under this Agreement or any other Loan Document is outstanding and unpaid. Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreements contained herein, indemnification and reimbursement obligations contained herein
(including, without limitation, pursuant to Sections 2.17 and 9.05) and the provisions of Article VIII shall survive the payment in full of the principal and interest hereunder or the termination of this Agreement. 
SECTION 9.03    Binding Effect. This Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the
Borrowers and the Agents and when the Agents shall have received copies hereof which, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Borrowers, the
Agents and each Lender and their respective permitted successors and assigns.  SECTION 9.04    Successors and
Assigns. (a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that (i) the Borrowers may not assign or otherwise
transfer any of their rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any attempted assignment or transfer by the Borrowers without such consent shall be null and void), and (ii) no Lender may assign or
otherwise transfer its rights or obligations hereunder except in accordance with this Section 9.04. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any person (other than the parties hereto, their respective
successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants (to the extent provided in paragraph (d) of this Section 9.04), and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Agents and the Lenders) any legal or
equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents. 
  99 


(b)    (i) Subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(ii) below,
any Lender may assign to one or more assignees other than any Borrowers or any of their Affiliates (each, an Assignee) all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of the Loans at
the time owing to it) with the prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of: 
(A)    Holdings (provided, that the consent of Holdings shall not be required if an Event of Default
shall have occurred and be continuing and provided, further, that no consent of Holdings shall be required for an assignment to another Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund); and 
(B)    the Administrative Agent; provided, that, no such consent shall be required for an assignment
to another Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender, an Approved Fund.  (ii)    Assignments shall be subject to
the following additional conditions:  (A)    except in the case of an assignment to a Lender, an
affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lenders Loans, the principal amount of the Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the
Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $1.0 million, unless the Administrative Agent otherwise consents; provided, that (such amounts shall be aggregated
in respect of each Lender and its Affiliates or Approved Funds (with simultaneous assignments to or by two or more Approved Funds shall be treated as one assignment), if any; 
(B)    the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment
and Acceptance via an electronic settlement system acceptable to the Administrative Agent (or, if previously agreed with the Administrative Agent, manually), and shall pay to the Administrative Agent a processing and recordation fee of $3,500 (which
fee may be waived or reduced in the sole discretion of the Administrative Agent); provided that only one such fee shall be due in respect of a simultaneous assignment to more than one Affiliate of a Lender or Approved Fund; and 
(C)    the Assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent on or prior to
the effective date of such assignment an Administrative Questionnaire and any tax forms required to be delivered pursuant to Section 2.17.  For the
purposes of this Section 9.04, Approved Fund means any person (other than a natural person) that is engaged in making, purchasing, holding or investing in bank loans and similar extensions of credit in the ordinary course and
that is administered or managed by (a) a Lender, (b) an Affiliate of a Lender or (c) an entity or an Affiliate of an entity that administers or manages a Lender. 
  100 


(iii)    Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant
to paragraph (b)(v) below, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance the Assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights
and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an
Assignment and Acceptance covering all of the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.17 and 9.05). Any
assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 9.04 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and
obligations in accordance with paragraph (d) of this Section 9.04.  (iv)    The
Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrowers, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register for the
recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders and principal amount of the Loans owing to each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the Register). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the
Borrowers, the Agents and the Lenders shall treat each person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. Failure to make any
such recordation, or any error in such recordation, shall not affect the Borrowers obligations in respect of such Loans. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrowers, the Collateral Agent and any Lender, at any reasonable
time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.  (v)    Upon its receipt of a duly completed
Assignment and Acceptance executed by an assigning Lender and an Assignee, the Assignees completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the Assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), all applicable tax forms, the processing and recordation
fee referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section and any written consent to such assignment required by paragraph (b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent promptly shall accept such Assignment and Acceptance and record the information
contained therein in the Register. No assignment, whether or not evidenced by a promissory note, shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph (b)(v). 
(c)    By executing and delivering an Assignment and Acceptance, the assigning Lender thereunder and the Assignee
thereunder shall be deemed to confirm to and agree with each other and the other parties hereto as follows: (i) such assigning Lender warrants that it is the legal and beneficial owner of the interest being assigned thereby free and clear of
any adverse 
  101 



claim and that the outstanding balances of its Loans, in each case without giving effect to assignments thereof which have not become effective, are as set forth in such Assignment and
Acceptance, (ii) except as set forth in clause (i) above, such assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to any statements, warranties or representations made in or in connection with
this Agreement, or the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto, or the financial condition of the
Borrowers or any Subsidiary or the performance or observance by the Borrowers or any Subsidiary of any of its obligations under this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; (iii) the
Assignee represents and warrants that it is legally authorized to enter into such Assignment and Acceptance; (iv) the Assignee confirms that it has received a copy of this Agreement, together with copies of the most recent financial statements
referred to in Section 3.05 (or delivered pursuant to Section 5.04), and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into such Assignment and Acceptance;
(v) the Assignee will independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, such assigning Lender or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own
credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement; (vi) the Assignee appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement as are
delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms of this Agreement, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto; and (vii) the Assignee agrees that it will perform in accordance with their terms all the obligations which by
the terms of this Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Lender.  (d)    (i) Any Lender may, with the prior
written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed of Holdings (provided, that the consent of Holdings shall not be required if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing), sell participations to one or more banks or
other entities (a Participant) in all or a portion of such Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of the Loans owing to it); provided, that (A) such Lenders
obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (C) the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the other
Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender
shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents; provided, that (x) such agreement
may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver that (1) requires the consent of each Lender directly affected thereby pursuant to Section 9.04(a)(i) or clauses (i),
(ii), (iii) or (iv) of the first proviso to Section 9.08(b) and (2) directly affects such Participant and (y) no other agreement with respect to amendment, modification or waiver may exist between such Lender and such Participant.
Subject to paragraph (c)(ii) of this Section 9.04, each Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.17 (subject to the requirements and limitations of such

  102 



Sections) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 9.04. To the extent permitted by law, each
Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.06 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant shall be subject to Section 2.18(c) as though it were a Lender. 
(ii)    A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.17 than the
applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrowers prior written consent (not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) or the entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a change in law that occurs after the Participant acquires the participation. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrowers, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and interest amounts) of each Participants interest in the Loans
or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the Participant Register); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any
Participant or any information relating to a Participants interest in any loans or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
(e)    Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this
Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank or any other central bank and in the case of any Lender that is an Approved Fund, any pledge or assignment to any
holders of obligations owed, or securities issued, by such Lender, including to any trustee for, or any other representative of, such holders, and this Section 9.04 shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest;
provided, that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or Assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. 
(f)    Each Borrower, upon receipt of written notice from the relevant Lender, agrees to issue Notes to any Lender
requiring Notes to facilitate transactions of the type described in paragraph (d) above.  (g)    Notwithstanding
the foregoing, any Conduit Lender may assign any or all of the Loans it may have funded hereunder to its designating Lender without the consent of the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent. Each of the Loan Parties, each Lender and the
Administrative Agent hereby confirms that it will not institute against a Conduit Lender or join any other person in instituting against a Conduit Lender any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceeding under any
state bankruptcy or similar law, for one year and one day after the payment in full of the latest maturing commercial paper note issued by such Conduit Lender; provided, however, that each Lender designating any Conduit Lender hereby
agrees to indemnify, save and hold harmless each other party hereto and the Borrowers for any loss, cost, damage or expense arising out of its inability to institute such a proceeding against such Conduit Lender during such period of forbearance.

  103 


(h)    [Reserved]. 
(i)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, no assignment may be made or participation sold to an Ineligible Institution without
the prior written consent of the Borrowers. Further, notwithstanding the foregoing, no assignment or pledge may be made or participation sold in a way that would result in non-compliance with the Swiss Non-Bank Rules and any such assignment, pledge or participation shall be rendered nul and void ab initio if it would result in non-compliance with the Swiss Non-Bank Rules. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Borrowers and the Lenders acknowledge and agree that the Administrative Agent shall have no responsibility to monitor whether
assignments or participations are made to Ineligible Institutions, and that none of the Borrowers or any of its Subsidiaries shall bring a claim to such effect. 
(j)    For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that a transfer or an assignment by an existing Lender of its rights
and/or obligations under this Agreement (and any relevant Loan Document) occurs or is deemed to occur by way of novation or otherwise, the existing Lender explicitly reserves the preservation of all securities and guarantees (if any) created under
any Loan Document for the benefit of the new Lender and the other beneficiaries of such security Parties in accordance with any applicable law, including, in respect of Luxembourg law, the provisions of article 1278 of the Luxembourg Civil Code.
 SECTION 9.05    Expenses; Indemnity. 
(a)    Subject in each case to the occurrence of the Closing Date, the Borrowers agree to pay (i) all reasonable out
of pocket expenses incurred by each Agent prior to the Closing Date in connection with the preparation of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (including in connection with due diligence and the reasonable fees, disbursements of charges of
counsel to the Agents), (ii) all reasonable out of pocket expenses (including Other Taxes) incurred by the Agents in connection with the administration of this Agreement and any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof or
thereof, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP, counsel for the Agents, and, if necessary, the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of such additional counsel as the Administrative
Agent or the Collateral Agent may require (and, in the case of an actual or potential conflict of interest, one addition counsel for the Collateral Agent), and (iii) all out of pocket expenses (including Other Taxes) incurred by the
Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender or any of their respective Affiliates in connection with the enforcement, collection or protection of their rights in connection with this Agreement and the other Loan Documents or in
connection with the Loans made hereunder, including the fees, charges and disbursements of counsel (including any special and local counsel). 
(b)    The Borrowers agree to indemnify the Agents, each Lender, each of their respective Affiliates and each of their
respective directors, trustees, officers, employees, agents, trustees and advisors (each such person being called an Indemnitee) against, and to hold each 
  104 



Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, obligations, liabilities, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs and related expenses or disbursements of any kind, including
reasonable counsel fees, charges and disbursements (except the allocated costs of in-house counsel), imposed or incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in any way connected with, or as a
result of (i) the execution or delivery of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby, the performance by the parties hereto and thereto of their respective obligations thereunder or
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) the use of the proceeds of the Loans or (iii) any claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether or not any Indemnitee is a party
thereto and regardless of whether such matter is initiated by a third party or by any Borrower or any of their subsidiaries or Affiliates; provided, that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such
losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses are determined by a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct
of such Indemnitee (for purposes of this proviso only, each of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and/or any Lender shall be treated as several and separate Indemnitees, but each of them together with its respective Related Parties shall
be treated as a single Indemnitee). None of the Indemnitees (or any of their respective affiliates) shall be responsible or liable to the Fund, any Borrower or any of their respective subsidiaries, Affiliates or stockholders or any other person or
entity for any special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages. The provisions of this Section 9.05 shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of the expiration of the term of this Agreement, the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, the resignation or removal of any Agent, the repayment of any of the Obligations, the invalidity or unenforceability of any term or provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or any investigation made
by or on behalf of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender.  (c)    Except as expressly provided
in Section 9.05(a) with respect to Other Taxes, which shall not be duplicative with any amounts paid pursuant to Section 2.17, this Section 9.05 shall not apply to Taxes other than Taxes that represent losses, claims, damages, liabilities
and expenses with respect to a non-Tax claim.  (d)    To the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, the Borrowers shall not assert, and hereby waive, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising
out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, any Loan or the use of the proceeds thereof. No Indemnitee
shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by unintended recipients of any information or other materials distributed by it through telecommunications, electronic or other information transmission systems in connection with this Agreement
or the other Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.  (e)    The agreements in this
Section 9.05 shall survive the resignation of the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, the replacement of any Lender and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all the other Obligations and the termination of this
Agreement. 
  105 


SECTION 9.06    Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, each Lender is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time
held and other indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender to or for the credit or the account of any Borrower or any Subsidiary against any of and all the obligations of the Borrowers now or hereafter existing under this Agreement or any other
Loan Document held by such Lender, irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement or such other Loan Document and although the obligations may be unmatured. The rights of each Lender under this
Section 9.06 are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that such Lender may have.  SECTION
9.07    Applicable Law. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS (OTHER THAN AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS) SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. 
SECTION 9.08    Waivers; Amendment. 
(a)    No failure or delay of the Administrative Agent or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder or under
any Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof
or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise
have. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or consent to any departure by the Borrowers or any other Loan Party therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph
(b) below, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. No notice or demand on the Borrowers or any other Loan Party in any case shall entitle such person to any other or
further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.  (b)    Neither this Agreement nor any other Loan Document
nor any provision hereof or thereof may be waived, amended or modified except (x) in the case of this Agreement, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrowers and the Required Lenders, and (y) in the case
of any other Loan Document, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by each party thereto and the Administrative Agent and consented to by the Required Lenders; provided, however, that no such agreement shall
 (i)    decrease or forgive the principal amount of, or extend the final maturity of, or decrease the
rate of interest on any Loan without the prior written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby, 
  106 


(ii)    decrease the fees of any Lender or any Agent without
the prior written consent of such Lender or Agent, as applicable,  (iii)    extend any date on which
payment of interest on any Loan or any fees is due, without the prior written consent of each Lender adversely affected thereby, 
(iv)    amend the provisions of Section 5.02 of the Security Agreement, or any analogous provision of
any other Security Document, in a manner that would by its terms alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby, without the prior written consent of each Lender adversely affected thereby, 
(v)    amend or modify the provisions of this Section 9.08 or the definition of the terms
Required Lenders or any other provision hereof specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or modify any rights hereunder or make any determination or grant any consent hereunder, without the prior written
consent of each Lender adversely affected thereby, or  (vi)    release all or substantially all of the
Collateral or release any of the Borrowers or all or substantially all of the Subsidiary Loan Parties from their respective Guarantees under the Guarantee Agreement, unless, in the case of a Subsidiary Loan Party, all or substantially all of the
Equity Interests of such Subsidiary Loan Party are sold or otherwise disposed of in a transaction permitted by this Agreement, without the prior written consent of each Lender; 
provided, further, that no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder without
the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent acting as such at the effective date of such agreement, as applicable, and notice of and a copy of any such agreements shall be provided to the Collateral Agent by the Borrowers. Each Lender
shall be bound by any waiver, amendment or modification authorized by this Section 9.08 and any consent by any Lender pursuant to this Section 9.08 shall bind any assignee of such Lender. 
(c)    (i) Guarantees, collateral security agreements, pledge agreements and related documents (if any) executed by the
Loan Parties in connection with this Agreement may be in a form reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent and may be amended, supplemented and/or waived with the consent of the Administrative Agent at the request of the Borrower without the
input or need to obtain the consent of any other Lenders if such amendment or waiver is delivered in order (x) to comply with local law or advice of local counsel, (y) to cure ambiguities, omissions or defects or (z) to cause such
guarantees, collateral security agreements, pledge agreement or other document to be consistent with this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and (ii) if the Administrative Agent and the Borrower have jointly identified any obvious error or
any error or omission of a technical nature or any necessary or desirable technical change, in each case, in any provision of the Loan Documents, then the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall be permitted to amend such provision.

SECTION 9.09    Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, if at any time the applicable interest rate, together with all fees and charges that are treated as interest under applicable law (collectively, the Charges), as provided for herein or in any other document
executed in connection herewith, or otherwise contracted for, charged, received, taken or reserved by any Lender, shall exceed the maximum lawful rate (the Maximum Rate) that may be contracted for, charged, taken, received or
reserved by such Lender in accordance with applicable law, the rate of interest payable hereunder, together with all Charges payable to such Lender, shall be limited to the Maximum Rate; provided, that such excess amount shall be paid to such
Lender on subsequent payment dates to the extent not exceeding the legal limitation.  SECTION 9.10    Entire
Agreement. This Agreement, the other Loan Documents and the agreements regarding certain fees referred to herein constitute the entire contract between the parties relative to the subject matter hereof. Any previous agreement among or
representations from the parties or their Affiliates with respect to the subject matter hereof is superseded by this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Collateral Agent Fee Letter shall survive the execution
and delivery of this Agreement and remain in full force and effect. Nothing in this Agreement or in the other Loan Documents, expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any party other than the parties hereto and thereto any rights, remedies,
obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents.  SECTION
9.11    WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF,
UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS. EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED

he event any one
or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document should be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein and therein
shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. The parties shall endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to
that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions.  SECTION 9.13    Counterparts. This Agreement may be
executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original but all of which, when taken 
  108 



together, shall constitute but one contract, and shall become effective as provided in Section 9.03. Delivery of an executed counterpart to this Agreement by facsimile transmission (or other
electronic transmission pursuant to procedures approved by the Administrative Agent) shall be as effective as delivery of a manually signed original. 
SECTION 9.14    Headings. Article and Section headings and the Table of Contents used herein are for convenience of
reference only, are not part of this Agreement and are not to affect the construction of, or to be taken into consideration in interpreting, this Agreement. 
SECTION 9.15    Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process. Each party hereto hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally:  (a)    submits for itself and its property in any legal action or proceeding relating
to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which it is a party, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect thereof, to the general and exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the State of New York for the County of
New York (the New York Supreme Court), and the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the Federal District Court, and together with the New York Supreme Court, the New Yo

ion or proceeding, a legal action or proceeding may be brought with respect thereto in another court having such jurisdiction; 
(ii)    in the event that a legal action or proceeding is brought against any party hereto or involving any
of its property or assets in another court (without any collusive assistance by such party or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates), such party shall be entitled to assert any claim or defense (including any claim or defense that this Section
9.15(c) would otherwise require to be asserted in a legal action or proceeding in a New York Court) in any such action or proceeding; 
  109 


(iii)    any party hereto may bring any legal action or
proceeding in any jurisdiction for the recognition and enforcement of any judgment;  (d)    agrees that
service of process in any such action or proceeding may be effected by mailing a copy thereof by registered or certified mail (or any substantially similar form of mail), postage prepaid, to Holdings, the applicable Lender or the applicable Agent,
as the case may be, at the address specified in Section 9.01 or at such other address of which the applicable Agent, any such Lender and Holdings shall have been notified pursuant thereto; and 
(e)    agrees that nothing herein shall affect the right to effect service of process in any other manner
permitted by law or (subject to the preceding clause (c)) shall limit the right to sue in any other jurisdiction. 
(f)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party hereto agrees that the Agents and the Lenders retain the
right to bring proceedings against any loan party in the courts of any other jurisdiction solely in connection with the exercise of any rights under any Security Document. 
(g)    Each Loan Party and each Subsidiary that is not located in the U.S. hereby irrevocably designates,
appoints and empowers Corporation Service Company (whose current address is: 80 State Street, Albany, New York 12207-2543, U.S.A.) (including any replacement agent as provided below, the Process Agent), in the case of any suit,
action or proceeding brought in the United States of America as its designee, appointee and agent to receive, accept and acknowledge for and on its behalf, and in respect of its property, service of any and all legal process, summons, notices and
documents that may be served in any action or proceeding arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document. Such service may be made by mailing (by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid) or delivering a copy of
such process to such Person in care of the Process Agent at the Process Agents above address, and each such non-U.S. Loan Party and Subsidiary hereby irrevocably authorizes and directs the Process Agent
to accept such service on its behalf. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by law. In the event of service of process in Switzerland, each Swiss Obligor hereby
designates as its domicile to receive service of process the domicile indicated in Section 9.01 and hereby waives any other jurisdiction that may be corresponding to it by reason of its present or future domiciles. 
SECTION 9.16    Confidentiality. Each of the Lenders and the Agents agrees that it shall maintain in confidence any
information relating the Borrowers and any Subsidiary furnished to it by or on behalf of the Borrowers or any Subsidiary (other than information that (a) has become generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by
such party in violation of this Section 9.16, (b) has been independently developed by such Lender or such Agent without violating this Section 9.16, (c) was available to such Lender or such Agent from a third party having, to such
persons knowledge, no obligations of confidentiality to the Borrowers or (d) is available to the Agents or any Lender on a non-confidential basis prior to

  110 



disclosure by any Loan Party) and shall not reveal the same other than to its and its Affiliates directors (or equivalent managers), trustees, officers, employees, accountants, auditors,
attorneys, advisors, and any numbering, administration or settlement service providers with a need to know or to any person that approves or administers the Loans on behalf of such Lender (so long as each such person shall have been instructed to
keep the same confidential in accordance with this Section 9.16), except: (A) to the extent necessary to comply with law or any legal process or the requirements of any Governmental Authority, the National Association of Insurance
Commissioners or of any securities exchange on which securities of the disclosing party or any Affiliate of the disclosing party are listed or traded, (B) as part of normal reporting or review procedures to, or examinations by, Governmental
Authorities or self-regulatory authorities, including the National Association of Insurance Commissioners or the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., (C) to its parent companies, Affiliates or auditors (so long as each such person shall
have been instructed to keep the same confidential in accordance with this Section 9.16), (D) in order to enforce its rights under any Loan Document in a legal proceeding, (E) to other Lenders and to any pledgee under Section 9.04(d) or
any other prospective assignee of, or prospective Participant in, any of its rights under this Agreement (so long as such person is subject to this Section 9.16 or shall have been instructed to keep the same confidential in accordance with this
Section 9.16), (F) to any direct or indirect actual or prospective contractual counterparty in Swap Agreements or similar products relating to the Loan Parties and their obligations, or such contractual counterpartys professional advisor
(so long as such contractual counterparty or professional advisor to such contractual counterparty agrees to be bound by the provisions of this Section 9.16), (G) with the prior written consent of the Borrower or (H) to the extent
applicable and reasonably necessary or advisable, for purposes of establishing a due diligence defense.  SECTION
9.17    Platform; Borrower Materials. The Borrowers and each Lender hereby acknowledge and agree the Administrative Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, make available to the Lenders materials and/or information
provided by or on behalf of the Borrowers hereunder (collectively, Borrower Materials) by posting the Borrower Materials on IntraLinks or another similar electronic system (the Platform). Any Platform used by
the Administrative Agent is provided as is and as available. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its Related Parties (collectively, the Agent Parties) warrants the accuracy or completeness of the
Borrower Materials, or the adequacy of the platform and they expressly disclaim liability for errors or omissions in the Borrower Materials. No warranty of any kind, express, implied or statutory, including any warranty of merchantability, fitness
for a particular purpose, non-infringement of third party rights or freedom from viruses or other code defects, is made by the Agent Parties in connection with the Borrower Materials or the Platform. In no
event shall the Agent Parties have any liability to any Loan Party, any Lender or any other Person or entity for damages of any kind including direct or indirect, special, incidental or consequential damages, losses or expenses (whether in tort,
contract or otherwise) arising out of any Loan Partys or the Administrative Agents transmission of Borrower Materials through the internet, except to the extent the liability of any Agent Party is found in a final non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted primarily from such Agent Partys gross negligence or willful misconduct; provided, however, that in no event shall any agent
have any liability to any Loan Party, any Lender or any other Person for indirect, special, incidental, 
  111 



consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages). Certain of the Lenders may be public-side Lenders (i.e., Lenders that do not wish to receive material non
public information with respect to any Borrower or its securities) (each, a Public Lender). Each Borrower hereby agrees that it will use commercially reasonable efforts to identify that portion of the Borrower Materials that may
be distributed to the Public Lenders and that (i) all such Borrower Materials shall be clearly and conspicuously marked PUBLIC which, at a minimum, shall mean that the word PUBLIC shall appear prominently on the first
page thereof, (ii) by marking Borrower Materials PUBLIC, the Borrowers shall be deemed to have authorized the Administrative Agent and the Lenders to treat such Borrower Materials as either publicly available information or not
material information (although it may be sensitive and proprietary) with respect to any Borrower or its securities for purposes of United States Federal and state securities laws, (iii) all Borrower Materials marked PUBLIC are
permitted to be made available through a portion of the Platform designated Public Investor; and (iv) the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to treat any Borrower Materials that are not marked PUBLIC as being
suitable only for posting on a portion of the Platform not designated Public Investor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following Borrower Materials shall be deemed to be marked PUBLIC, unless Holdings notifies the
Administrative Agent promptly that any such document contains material nonpublic information: (1) the Loan Documents, (2) any notification of changes in the terms of the credit facilities and (3) all information delivered pursuant to
Section 5.04.  SECTION 9.18    Release of Liens and Guarantees. In the event that any Loan Party conveys,
sells, leases, assigns, transfers or otherwise disposes of all or any portion of any of the Equity Interests or assets of any Subsidiary Loan Party to a person that is not (and is not required to become) a Loan Party in a transaction not prohibited
by Section 6.05, any Liens created by any Loan Document in respect of such Equity Interests or assets shall be automatically released and the Collateral Agent shall promptly (and the Lenders hereby authorize the Collateral Agent to) take such
action and execute any such documents as may be reasonably requested by the Borrowers and at the Borrowers expense in connection with the release of any Liens created by any Loan Document in respect of such Equity Interests or assets, and, in
the case of a disposition of the Equity Interests of any Subsidiary Loan Party in a transaction permitted by Section 6.05 (including through merger, consolidation, amalgamation or otherwise) and as a result of which such Subsidiary Loan Party
would cease to be a Subsidiary, such Subsidiary Loan Partys obligations under its Guarantee shall be automatically terminated and the Collateral Agent shall promptly (and the Lenders hereby authorize the Collateral Agent to) take such action
and execute any such documents as may be reasonably requested by the Borrowers to terminate such Subsidiary Loan Partys obligations under its Guarantee. In addition, the Collateral Agent agrees to take such actions as are reasonably requested
by the Borrowers and at the Borrowers expense to terminate the Liens and security interests created by the Loan Documents when all the Obligations (other than contingent indemnification Obligations and expense reimbursement claims to the
extent no claim therefor has been made) are paid in full and this Agreement is terminated.  SECTION
9.19    Judgment Currency. If, for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court, it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder or any other Loan 
  112 



Document in one currency into another currency, the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Administrative Agent could purchase the first
currency with such other currency on the Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is given. The obligations of the Borrowers in respect of any such sum due from it to the Administrative Agent or the Lenders hereunder or under the other
Loan Documents shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency (the Judgment Currency) other than that in which such sum is denominated in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement (the Agreement
Currency), be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any sum adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency, the Administrative Agent may in accordance with normal banking
procedures purchase the Agreement Currency with the Judgment Currency. If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent from the Borrowers in the Agreement Currency, each Borrower
agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the Administrative Agent or the person to whom such obligation was owing against such loss. If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is greater than the
sum originally due to the Administrative Agent in such currency, the Administrative Agent agrees to return the amount of any excess to the Borrowers (or to any other person who may be entitled thereto under applicable law). 
SECTION 9.20    USA PATRIOT Act Notice. Each Lender that is subject to the Act (as hereinafter defined) and each of
the Agents (for itself and not on behalf of any Lender) hereby notifies the Borrowers that consistent with the requirements of the USA PATRIOT Act, it may be required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Borrowers, which
information includes the name and address of the Borrowers and other information that will allow such Lender or the Agents, as applicable, to identify the Borrowers in accordance with the USA PATRIOT Act. 
SECTION 9.21    Borrower Representative. Each Borrower hereby irrevocably designates Borrower Representative to be
its attorney and agent and in such capacity to borrow, sign and endorse notes, and execute and deliver all instruments, documents, writings and further assurances now or hereafter required hereunder, on behalf of such Borrower, and hereby authorizes
Agent to pay over or credit all loan proceeds hereunder in accordance with the request of Borrowing Representative.  SECTION
9.22    No Advisory or Fiduciary Responsibility. In connection with all aspects of each transaction contemplated hereby (including in connection with any amendment, waiver or other modification hereof or of any other Loan
Document), each Borrower acknowledges (on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates) and agrees that (i) (A) the arranging and other services regarding this Agreement provided by the Agents and the Lenders are arms-length commercial transactions between the Borrowers and their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Agents and the Lenders, on the other hand, (B) each of the Borrowers has consulted its
own legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent it has deemed appropriate, and (C) each of the Borrowers is capable of evaluating, and understands and accepts, the terms, risks and conditions of the transactions contemplated
hereby and by the other Loan Documents; (ii) (A) each of the Agents and the Lenders is and has been acting solely 
  113 



as a principal and has not been, is not and will not be acting as an advisor, agent or fiduciary for the Borrowers, any of their respective Affiliates or any other Person and (B) none of the
Agents or the Lenders has any obligation to the Borrowers or any of their respective Affiliates with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby except those obligations expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents; and
(iii) the Agents or the Lenders and their respective Affiliates may be engaged in a broad range of transactions that involve interests that differ from those of the Borrowers and their Affiliates, and none of the Agents or the Lenders has any
obligation to disclose any of such interests to any Borrower or any of its Affiliates. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrowers hereby waive and release any claims that they may have against the Agents or the Lenders with
respect to any breach or alleged breach of agency or fiduciary duty in connection with any aspect of any transaction contemplated hereby. 
SECTION 9.23    Acknowledgement and Consent to Bail-In of EEA Financial
Institutions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Loan Document or in any other agreement, arrangement or understanding among any such parties, each party hereto acknowledges that any liability of any Lender that is an EEA Financial
Institution arising under any Loan Document, to the extent such liability is unsecured, may be subject to the write-down and conversion powers of an EEA Resolution Authority and agrees and consents to, and acknowledges and agrees to be bound by:
 (a)    the application of any Write-Down and Conversion Powers by an EEA Resolution Authority to any
such liabilities arising hereunder which may be payable to it by any Lender that is an EEA Financial Institution; and 
(b)    the effects of any Bail-in Action on any such liability,
including, if applicable:  (i)    a reduction in full or in part or cancellation of any such liability;
 (ii)    a conversion of all, or a portion of, such liability into shares or other instruments of
ownership in such EEA Financial Institution, its parent undertaking, or a bridge institution that may be issued to it or otherwise conferred on it, and that such shares or other instruments of ownership will be accepted by it in lieu of any rights
with respect to any such liability under this Agreement or any other Loan Document; or  (iii)    the
variation of the terms of such liability in connection with the exercise of the write-down and conversion powers of any EEA Resolution Authority. 
SECTION 9.24    Affiliate Lenders. 
(a)    Each Lender who is an Affiliate of Holdings, excluding (x) CGHL, the Borrowers and their respective
Subsidiaries and (y) any Debt Fund Affiliate Lender (each, an Affiliate Lender; it being understood that (x) neither CGHL, the Borrowers, nor any of the Subsidiaries may be Affiliate Lenders and (y) Debt Fund
Affiliate Lenders and Affiliate Lenders may be Lenders hereunder in accordance with Section 9.04, subject in the case of Affiliate 
  114 



Lenders, to this Section 9.24), in connection with any (i) consent (or decision not to consent) to any amendment, modification, waiver, consent or other action with respect to any of
the terms of any Loan Document, (ii) other action on any matter related to any Loan Document or (iii) direction to the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender to undertake any action (or refrain from taking any action)
with respect to or under any Loan Document, agrees that, except with respect to any amendment, modification, waiver, consent or other action (1) described in clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) of the first proviso of Section 9.08(b) or
(2) that adversely affects such Affiliate Lender (in its capacity as a Lender) in a disproportionately adverse manner as compared to other Lenders, such Affiliate Lender shall be deemed to have voted its interest as a Lender without discretion
in such proportion as the allocation of voting with respect to such matter by Lenders who are not Affiliate Lenders. Each Affiliate Lender hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent (such appointment being coupled with an interest) as such
Affiliate Lenders attorney-in-fact, with full authority in the place and stead of such Affiliate Lender and in the name of such Affiliate Lender, from time to time
in the Administrative Agents discretion to take any action and to execute any instrument that the Administrative Agent may deem reasonably necessary to carry out the provisions of this clause (a). 
(b)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no Affiliate Lender shall have any right to
(1) attend (including by telephone) any meeting or discussions (or portion thereof) among the Administrative Agent or any Lender to which representatives of the Borrowers are not then present, (2) receive any information or material
prepared by Administrative Agent or any Lender or any communication by or among Administrative Agent and/or one or more Lenders, except to the extent such information or materials have been made available to Holdings or its representatives,
(3) make or bring (or participate in, other than as a passive participant in or recipient of its pro rata benefits of) any claim, in its capacity as a Lender, against Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any other Lender with respect
to any duties or obligations or alleged duties or obligations of such Agent or any other such Lender under the Loan Documents, or (4) purchase any Term Loan if, immediately after giving effect to such purchase, Affiliate Lenders in the
aggregate would own Term Loans with an aggregate principal amount in excess of 30% of the aggregate principal amount of all Term Loans then outstanding. It shall be a condition precedent to each assignment to an Affiliate Lender that such Affiliate
Lender shall have (x) represented to the assigning Lender in the applicable Assignment and Acceptance, and notified the Administrative Agent, that it is (or will be, following the consummation of such assignment) an Affiliate Lender and that
the aggregate amount of Term Loans held by it giving effect to such assignments shall not exceed the amount permitted by clause (d) of the preceding sentence and (y) represented in the applicable Assignment and Acceptance that it is not in
possession of material non-public information (within the meaning of United States federal and state securities laws) with respect to each Parent Entity, CGHL, the Borrowers, the Subsidiaries or their
respective securities (or, if neither any Parent Company nor CGHL is not at the time a public reporting company, material information of a type that would not be reasonably expected to be publicly available if any Parent Entity or CGHL were a public
reporting company) that (A) has not been disclosed to the assigning Lender or the Lenders generally (other than because any such Lender does not wish to receive material non-public information with
respect to any Parent Entity, CGHL, the Borrowers or the Subsidiaries) and (B) could reasonably be expected to have a material effect upon, or otherwise be material to, the assigning Lenders decision make such assignment. 
  115 


SECTION 9.25    Appointment for Perfection; Disclosure. 
Each Lender hereby appoints each other Lender as its agent for the purpose of perfecting Liens, for the benefit of the Collateral Agent and the
Lenders, in assets which, in accordance with Article 9 of the UCC or any other applicable law can be perfected only by possession. Should any Lender (other than the Collateral Agent) obtain possession of any such Collateral, such Lender shall notify
the Collateral Agent thereof and, promptly upon the Collateral Agents request therefor shall deliver such Collateral to the Collateral Agent or otherwise deal with such Collateral in accordance with the Collateral Agents instructions.
Each Loan Party and each Lender hereby acknowledges and agrees that each Agent and/or its Affiliates from time to time may hold investments in, make other loans to or have other relationships with any of the Loan Parties and their respective
Affiliates.  SECTION 9.26    Conflicts; German Loan Parties. 
(a)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any other Loan Document, in the event of any
conflict or inconsistency between this Agreement and any other Loan Document, the terms of this Agreement shall govern and control. 
(b)    In respect of any liability of a Loan Party incorporated under German law (or any of its direct or indirect
Subsidiaries) under this Agreement as a result of any joint and several liability or similar liability for amounts (including fees, interest and other payment obligations attributable to such amounts) borrowed by any other Loan Party, Section
1.11(d) of the Guarantee Agreement shall apply mutatis mutandis.  (c)    In respect of any secondary liability (i.e.
resulting from a joint and several liability, guarantee or indemnity under this Agreement) of a Loan Party incorporated under German law, Section 1.11 (d) of the Guarantee Agreement shall apply mutatis mutandis.

SCHEDULE 1.01E 
Agreed Security Principles   


1.
Considerations  In determining what Liens over any asset will be provided in support of the Obligations
and all rights and obligations associated with such giving or taking of Liens over any asset, the following matters will be taken into account. Liens over any asset shall not be created or perfected to the extent that it would: 
 


 
(a)
result in any breach of applicable general law and statutory limitation, corporate benefit, capital maintenance, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, retention of title claims or thin capitalisation
laws or regulations (or analogous restrictions) of any applicable jurisdiction;   


 
(b)
result in a significant risk to the officers of the relevant Loan Party of contravention of their fiduciary duties and/or of civil or criminal liability; or 
 


 
(c)
result in costs that, in the opinion of the Collateral Agent (acting reasonably), are disproportionate to the benefit obtained by the beneficiaries of that Collateral. For the avoidance of doubt, in these Agreed
Security Principles, cost includes, but is not limited to, income tax cost, registration taxes payable on the creation or enforcement or for the continuance of any Lien, stamp duties, out-of-pocket expenses, and other fees and expenses directly incurred by the relevant Loan Party or any of its direct or indirect owners, subsidiaries or Affiliates. 
All Collateral (other than share security) shall be governed by the law of and secure assets located in the jurisdiction of incorporation of that Loan Party.
 The giving of a guarantee, the granting of security or the perfection of the security granted will not be required if: 
 


 
(a)
a Loan Party is prohibited by or lacks legal capacity as a result of, any applicable law, rule or legal principle (including financial assistance and corporate benefit regulations or prohibitions, fraudulent preference,
thin capitalization, capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance or similar rules or legal principles); or   


 
(b)
it has or is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the tax arrangements of the Loan Parties or any Loan Party; provided that the relevant Loan Party shall use reasonable endeavours to overcome such
obstacle.  The Secured Obligations will be limited where necessary to prevent any material additional tax liability of any Loan Party. 
In the case of any security granted by any Loan Party located in England and Wales, no fixed security will be given over bank accounts subject to pooling
arrangements, inventory, receivables or non-material intellectual property rights which instead in each case shall be subject to floating security. 
  7 


If a Loan Party grants security over any asset it shall, subject to the terms of the Loan Documents, be free to
deal with that asset in the ordinary course of its business until the occurrence and continuation of an Event of Default. For the avoidance of doubt, an Event of Default shall be continuing until such time as it may be waived by the Lenders in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement.   


2.
Obligations to be Secured  Subject to paragraph 1 above and except where the Lenders own template
security documentation is used, the obligations to be secured are the Secured Obligations (as defined below).  The Collateral is to be granted in favor of
the Collateral Agent (for the benefit of the Lenders).  For ease of reference, the following definitions should, to the extent legally possible and to the
extent appropriate, be incorporated into each Security Document:  Charged Property means all of the assets which from
time to time are, or are expressed to be, the subject of the Collateral.  Delegate means any delegate, agent, attorney
or co-trustee appointed by the Collateral Agent.  Group means Claires
Stores Inc. and its subsidiaries.  Receiver means a receiver or receiver and manager or administrative receiver of the
whole.  Secured Obligations means all present and future liabilities and obligations at any time due, owing or incurred
by any member of the Group and by each Loan Party to any Secured Party under the Loan Documents, both actual and contingent and whether incurred solely or jointly and as principal or surety or in any other capacity. 
Secured Parties means the Agents, any Receiver or Delegate and the Lenders. 
All other capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Agreement. 
 


3.
General  Where appropriate, defined terms in the Security Documents should mirror those in this
Agreement.  Any guaranty required pursuant to this Agreement shall be limited to the extent (i) required to be limited under applicable local law and
(ii) providing such a guaranty could reasonably be expected to (a) conflict with the fiduciary duties of the directors and managers of the relevant 
  8 



entity or (b) result in a risk of personal or criminal liability for such Guarantor or any of its officers, employees, members of management, consultants, directors or managers, and the
Security Documents relating to any Guarantor shall reflect any such limitations.  To the extent possible under applicable laws: 
 


 
(a)
the Collateral shall be enforceable on and from the occurrence and continuation of an Event of Default;   


 
(b)
any Liens over Collateral will be first ranking, to the extent possible and subject to any security interest over the relevant asset which is expressly permitted by the terms of this Agreement and which is already
expressed to be first ranking; and   


 
(c)
to the extent possible and subject to any other legal requirement, the documentation in respect of any Liens granted by any Loan Parties following the Closing Date shall mirror the documentation in respect of Liens
granted by the Loan Parties on the Closing Date.  The granting of security, perfection of Liens, when required, and other legal formalities
will be completed as soon as practicable and, in any event, within the time periods specified in the relevant Loan Documents or (if earlier or to the extent no such time periods are specified in the Loan Documents) within the time periods specified
by applicable law in order to ensure due perfection.  Information, such as lists of assets, will be provided promptly upon the Collateral Agents
reasonable request, in each case unless applicable local law or any applicable Loan Document requires more frequent information.  A reference in a
Security Document to an asset being material will mean an asset that is material in the context of the business of the Loan Parties as a whole. 
To the extent possible, all Collateral shall be granted in favour of the Collateral Agent acting on behalf of the Agents and Lenders individually.
Trust, parallel debt or joint and several creditorship provisions will be used where necessary; such provisions will be contained in the Credit Agreement unless required otherwise under applicable laws. To the
maximum extent possible, no action shall be required in relation to the security when any Lender transfers any of its participation in the Facilities to a new Lender. If any action is required upon a transfer of participation, the transferring
Lender will bear all related costs and expenses (including stamp duties, taxes, registration costs).  Collateral, will where possible and practical,
automatically create security over future assets of the same type as those already secured. Where local law requires supplemental pledges to be delivered in respect of future acquired assets in order for effective security to be created over that
class of assets, supplemental pledges shall be provided no more frequently than annually (unless expressly required more frequently under local law). 
Security Documents will not accrue interest on any amount in respect of which interest is accruing under this Agreement. 
  9 


Any rights of set off will not be exercisable until the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of
Default. Such rights shall apply only to matured obligations due and payable to the Agents and Lenders by a Loan Party under a Loan Document.  Where a
Loan Party acquires assets (including real property) of material value or significance for the business of such Loan Party after the date on which it initially grants security, such Loan Party shall (unless existing Collateral automatically creates
valid security over such assets) enter into security arrangements in accordance with Section 5.10 of the Credit Agreement.  Shares 
Liens shall be granted over shares in the Loan Parties and Subsidiaries. The company providing the relevant Collateral will be permitted to retain and to
exercise voting rights appertaining to any shares charged by it until the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default.  The Collateral
Agent may only exercise the voting rights to the extent permitted under applicable law and provided:   


 
(a)
an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; and   


 
(b)
the Collateral Agent notifies the provider of the relevant share security and the company whose shares are subject to the relevant share security that it seeks to exercise those voting rights. 
Until an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing the company whose shares are subject to that security will be permitted to pay dividends upstream in
respect of its shares to the extent permitted under the Loan Documents.  Receivables 
To the extent that notification of a third party is required in order to perfect a security interest in receivables (other than in respect of intercompany
receivables or where notification is required by applicable law to create such security interest), such notification will not be required until the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default. If such notification is required, it
will be delivered within five Business Days of the security being granted and the applicable Loan Party shall use its reasonable efforts to obtain an acknowledgement of that notice within twenty Business Days of service. If the Loan Party has used
its best efforts but has not been able to obtain acknowledgement, its obligation to obtain acknowledgement shall cease on the expiry of that twenty Business Day period. 
Until the occurrence and during the continuation of Event of Default the Loan Party providing the Collateral is permitted to receive any payment under its
receivables to the extent permitted under the Loan Documents.  Any receivables subject to third party arrangements (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt,
receivables owing from any Affiliate of any Loan Party) which are permitted by the Loan Documents which would prevent or prohibit such receivables from being subject to legal, valid, binding and enforceable security (but only to the extent such
prohibition was not created in 
  10 



contemplation hereof and is consistent with the business practice of Holdings and the Subsidiaries) will be excluded from the security created by any relevant security document, provided that the
relevant Loan Party has used reasonable endeavours to obtain any necessary consent or waiver if the asset is material, it being acknowledged that reasonable endeavours shall not require the payment by any Loan Party of any monetary consent or
waiver.  Bank accounts (including bank account receivables) 
Until the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default or as expressly agreed otherwise (for example in relation to an account used for cash
cover purpose) the Loan Party providing the Collateral is permitted to withdraw and transfer monies from the accounts to the extent permitted or not expressly restricted under the Loan Documents. 
If required by or customary under local law to perfect the Lien, notice of the Lien will be served on the account bank within five Business Days of the Lien
granted and the Loan Party shall use its reasonable endeavours (not involving the payment of money or incurrence of any external expenses) to obtain an acknowledgement of that within twenty Business Days of service. 
Any obligation on the Loan Party to use such reasonable endeavours to obtain an acknowledgement from such bank of the notification shall cease on the expiry
of the above mentioned twenty Business Days period.  Irrespective of whether notice of the Lien is required for perfection, if the service of notice would
prevent the Loan Party from using a bank account in the ordinary course of its business consistent with past practice, no notice of the Lien shall be served until the occu

 such consent within sixty days of the opening of the account, it being acknowledged that reasonable endeavours shall not require the payment by any Loan Party of any material monetary consent fee or administrative
fee.  Any Lien over bank accounts shall be subject to any prior security interests in favour of the account bank which are created either by law or in the
standard terms and conditions of the account bank or as part of the Groups cash management arrangements (provided such arrangements constitute Permitted Liens). 
The notice of the Lien shall request such prior security interests in favour of the account bank to be waived by the account bank but the Loan Party shall not
be required to change its banking arrangements if these security interests are not waived or only partially waived.  Material Contracts 
Where a Loan Party grants security over Material Contracts, such security shall be subject to these Agreed Security Principles. Where required by local law to
perfect the Collateral, notice will be served on the relevant counterparty within five Business Days of the Collateral being granted and the Loan Party shall use its reasonable endeavours to obtain an acknowledgement of that notice within twenty
Business Days of service. 
  11 


Any Material Contracts subject to third party arrangements (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any Material
Contract with any Affiliate of any Loan Party) which are permitted by the Loan Documents which would prevent or prohibit those assets from being subject to legal, valid, binding and enforceable security (but only to the extent such prohibition was
not created in contemplation hereof) will be excluded from the security created by any relevant security document, provided that the relevant Loan Party has used reasonable endeavours to obtain any necessary consent or waiver if the asset is
material, it being acknowledged that reasonable endeavours shall not require the payment by any Loan Party of any monetary consent or waiver. 
Insurance policies  Where a Loan Party grants security
over insurance policies, such security shall be subject to these Agreed Security Principles. Where required by local law to perfect the Collateral, notice will be served on the insurance provider within five Business Days of the Collateral being
granted and the Loan Party. Any obligation on the Loan Party to use reasonable endeavours to obtain an acknowledgement from such insurance provider of such notification shall cease on the expiry of the twenty Business Days period. 
Moveables  Until the occurrence and during the
continuation of an Event of Default and to the extent permitted under the Loan Documents the Loan Party providing the Collateral is permitted to dispose and use its moveable assets. 
If the granting of effective security over moveable assets gives rise to registration rights or similar taxes or costs calculated on the secured amount, the
secured amount under such security will be proportionate to the value of the underlying moveable asset, and mandates to grant security will be granted where customary. 
Intellectual property  Where a Loan Party grants security
over its intellectual property it shall be free to deal with those assets in the ordinary course of its business and in accordance with the Loan Documents until an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. No notice shall be prepared or given
to any third party (other than any Affiliate of Holdings) from whom intellectual property is licenced until an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. 
If required under local law security over intellectual property will be registered under the law of that security document or at a relevant supra-na

in leased real
property. 
  12 


If the granting of effective real property security gives rise to registration rights or similar taxes or costs
calculated on the secured amount, the secured amount under such security will be proportionate to the value of the underlying real estate, and mandates to grant security will be granted where customary. 
There will be no obligation to investigate title, provide surveys or other insurance or environmental due diligence, except to the extent reasonably available
and to the extent commercially reasonable to be so provided.  Fixed Assets 
Where a Loan Party grants security over material fixed assets, such security shall be subject to these Agreed Security Principles. 
No notice whether to third parties or by attaching a notice to the fixed assets shall be prepared or given until an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, unless, in the case of attachment of a notice, this is required by local law to create or maintain the existence of Collateral.  If required
under local law, Collateral over fixed assets will be registered subject to the general principles set out in these Agreed Security Principles.   


4.
Undertakings/Representations and Warranties  The Security Documents shall only include representations,
warranties or undertakings to the extent required under the governing law of that Security Document or to protect or preserve the Liens in the applicable Collateral created under that Security Document. 
Any representations, warranties or undertakings which are required to be included in any Security Document shall reflect (to the extent to which the subject
matter of such representation, warranty and undertaking is the same as the corresponding representation, warranty and undertaking in this Agreement) the commercial deal set out in this Agreement (save to the extent that Secured Parties local
counsel reasonably deem it necessary to include any further provisions (or deviate from those contained in this Agreement) solely in order to protect or preserve the security interest in and Liens on the Collateral granted to the Secured Parties).

pursuant to the Credit Agreement and is willing to execute and deliver this Agreement in order to induce the Lenders to extend such credit. Accordingly, the parties hereto agree as follows: 
ARTICLE I  GUARANTEE
 SECTION 1.01. Guarantee. Each Guarantor unconditionally guarantees, jointly with the other Guarantors and
severally, as a primary obligor and not merely as a surety, the due and punctual payment and performance of the Obligations, whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of anyone other than such Guarantor. Each Guarantor further
agrees that the Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice to or further assent from it, and that it will remain bound upon its guarantee notwithstanding any extension or renewal of any Obligation. Each Guarantor
waives diligence, presentment to, protest, demand of payment from and protest to any Borrower or any other Loan Party of any Obligation, and also waives notice of acceptance of its guarantee and notice of protest for nonpayment. 
SECTION 1.02. Guarantee of Payment. Each Guarantor further agrees that its guarantee hereunder constitutes a guarantee of
payment when due and payable and not of collection, and waives any right to require that any resort be had by the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party to any security held for the payment of the Obligations or to any balance of any deposit
account or credit on the books of the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party in favor of any Borrower or any other person (as defined in the Credit Agreement). 
SECTION 1.03. Guarantor Intent. Subject to the limitations set forth in Sections 1.10 and 1.11, each Guarantor expressly
confirms that it intends that this guarantee shall extend from time to time to any (however fundamental) variation, increase, extension or addition of or to any of the Loan 
  - 2 - 



Documents and/or any facility or amount made available under any of the Loan Documents (including, without limitation, for the purposes of or in connection with any acquisition of any nature,
increasing working capital, enabling investor distributions to be made, carrying out restructurings, refinancing existing facilities, refinancing any other indebtedness, making facilities available to additional borrowers, any other variation or
extension of the purposes for which any such facility or amount might be made available from time to time and any fees, costs and/or expenses associated with any of the foregoing). The foregoing notwithstanding, the Administrative Agent and the
Collateral Agent (directly or at the direction of any of Lenders or the Secured Parties) may, in accordance with the ten Business Days term in Section 4.17, request any of the Guarantors to ratify (either in a private or in a public
document before a notary) and carry out all necessary acts in order to confirm any such extension from time to time to any (however fundamental) variation, increase, extension or addition of or to any of the Loan Documents and/or any facility or
amount made available under any of the Loan Documents (including, without limitation, for the purposes of or in connection with any acquisition of any nature, increasing working capital, enabling investor distributions to be made, carrying out
restructurings, refinancing existing facilities, refinancing any other indebtedness, making facilities available to additional borrowers, any other variation or extension of the purposes for which any such facility or amount might be made available
from time to time and any fees, costs and/or expenses associated with any of the foregoing).  SECTION 1.04. No Limitations,
Etc.  (a) Except for the limitations set forth in Sections 1.10 and 1.11, the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be
subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason, including any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise, and shall not be subject to any defense or setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination
whatsoever by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the Obligations or otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall be valid and enforceable and shall not be
discharged, terminated, reduced or impaired or otherwise affected by, whether or not any Guarantor shall have had notice or knowledge of any of them, (i) the failure of the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party to assert any claim or
demand or to enforce any right or remedy under the provisions of any Loan Document or otherwise, (ii) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of, or any release from any of the terms or provisions of, any Loan Document or any other
agreement, including with respect to any other Guarantor under this Agreement, (iii) the release of, or any impairment of or failure to perfect any Lien on or security interest in, any security held by the Collateral Agent or any other Secured
Party for the Obligations or any of them, (iv) any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of the Obligations, (v) the existence of any dispute between any Borrower and any Secured Party with respect to the
existence of any Event of Default or (vi) any other act or omission that may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of any Guarantor or otherwise operate as a discharge of any Guarantor as a matter of law or equity (other than
the indefeasible payment in full in cash of all the Obligations (other than those expressly stated to survive the Maturity Date)). Each Guarantor expressly authorizes the Collateral Agent to take and hold security for the payment and performance of
the Obligations, to exchange, waive or release any or all such security (with or without consideration), to enforce or apply such security and direct the order and manner of any sale thereof in its sole discretion or to release or substitute any one
or more other guarantors or obligors upon or in respect of the Obligations, all without affecting the obligations of any Guarantor hereunder. 
(b) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Guarantor waives (i) any defense based on or arising out of any defense of
any Borrower or any other Loan Party or the validity or unenforceability of the Obligations or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the liability of any Borrower or any other Loan Party, other than the indefeasible
payment in full in cash of all the Obligations (other than those expressly stated to survive the Maturity Date); (ii) any right to require any Secured Party, as a condition of payment or performance by such Guarantor, to (A) proceed

  - 3 - 



against any Borrower, any other guarantor (including any other Guarantor) of the Obligations or any other person, (B) proceed against or exhaust any security held from any Borrower, any such
other guarantor (including any other Guarantor) or any other person, (C) proceed against or have resort to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of any Secured Party in favor of any Borrower or any other person, or
(D) pursue any other remedy in the power of any Secured Party whatsoever; (iii) any defense based upon any applicable law which provides that the obligation of a surety must be neither larger in amount nor in other respects more burdensome
than that of the principal; (iv) any defense based upon any Secured Partys errors or omissions in the administration of the Obligations, except behavior which amounts to gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct; (v) (A) any
principles or provisions of applicable law, which are or might be in conflict with the terms hereof and any legal or equitable discharge of such Guarantors obligations hereunder, (B) the benefit of any statute of limitations affecting
such Guarantors liability hereunder or the enforcement hereof, (C) any rights to set offs, recoupments and counterclaims, and (D) promptness, diligence and any requirement that any Secured Party protect, secure, perfect or insure any
security interest or lien or any property subject thereto; (vi) notices, demands, presentments, protests, notices of protest, notices of dishonor and notices of any action or inaction, including acceptance hereof, notices of default hereunder,
or any agreement or instrument related thereto, notices of any renewal, extension or modification of the Obligations or any agreement related thereto, notices of any extension of credit to any Borrower and notices of any of the matters referred to
in this Section 1.04 and any right to consent to any thereof; and (vii) any defenses or benefits that may be derived from or afforded by law which limit the liability of or exonerate guarantors or sureties, or which may conflict with the
terms hereof. Following the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Collateral Agent and the other Secured Parties may, at their election, foreclose on any security held by one or more of them by one or more judicial or
nonjudicial sales, accept an assignment of any such security in lieu of foreclosure, compromise or adjust any part of the Obligations, make any other accommodation with any Borrower or any other Loan Party or exercise any other right or remedy
available to them against any Borrower or any other Loan Party, without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of any Guarantor hereunder except to the extent the Obligations (other than those expressly stated to survive the Maturity Date)
have been fully and indefeasibly paid in full in cash. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Guarantor waives any defense arising out of any such election (other than the indefeasible payment in full in cash of the Obligations
(other than those expressly stated to survive the Maturity Date)) even though such election operates, pursuant to applicable law, to impair or to extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of such Guarantor against
any Borrower or any other Loan Party, as the case may be, or any security.  (c) Each Guarantor agrees that its obligations hereunder are
irrevocable, absolute, independent and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance which constitutes a legal or equitable discharge of a guarantor or surety other than the indefeasible payment in full in cash of the Obligations
(other than those expressly stated to survive the Maturity Date). In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, each Guarantor agrees as follows: 
(i) the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder are independent of the obligations of the Borrowers and the obligations of any
other guarantor (including any other Guarantor) in respect of the obligations of any Borrower, and a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against such Guarantor whether or not any action is brought against any Borrower or any of
such other guarantors (including any other Guarantor) and whether or not any Borrower is joined in any such action or actions; 
(ii) payment by any Guarantor of a portion, but not all, of the Obligations shall in no way limit, affect, modify, release,
reduce or abridge any Guarantors liability for any portion of the Obligations which has not been paid; 
  - 4 - 


(iii) any Secured Party, in accordance with the Credit Agreement, upon such terms
as it deems appropriate, without notice or demand and without affecting the validity or enforceability hereof or giving rise to any reduction, limitation, impairment, discharge or termination of any Guarantors liability hereunder, from time to
time may (A) renew, extend, accelerate, increase the rate of interest on, or otherwise change the time, place, manner or terms of payment of the Obligations and (B) request and accept other guaranties of the Obligations and take and hold
security for the payment hereof or the Obligations. The foregoing notwithstanding, the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent (directly or at the direction of any of the Secured Parties) may, in accordance with the ten Business Days
term in Section 4.17, request any of the Guarantors to ratify (either in a private or in a public document before a notary) and carry out all necessary acts in order to reflect any such renewal, extension, acceleration, increased rate of
interest, or other change in the time, place, manner or terms of payment of the Obligations; and  (iv) any Secured Party
may exercise any other rights or remedies available to it under the Loan Documents.  SECTION 1.05. Bankruptcy, etc.
 (a) To the extent permitted under applicable law, the obligations of the Guarantors hereunder shall not be reduced, limited, impaired,
discharged, deferred, suspended or terminated by any case, filing, petition, application, plan of arrangement or proceeding, voluntary or involuntary, involving the bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, reorganization, liquidation or arrangement of
any Borrower or any other Guarantor, or the appointment of a receiver, administrative receiver, interim receiver, receiver and manager, administrator, judicial manager, trustee, custodian, sequestrator, conservator, controller or any similar
official or by any defense which any Borrower or any other Guarantor may have by reason of the order, decree or decision of any court or administrative body resulting from any such case, filing, petition, application, plan of arrangement proceeding
unless also stayed in connection with the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of such Guarantor.  (b) To the extent permitted under
applicable law, each Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that any interest on any portion of the Obligations which accrues after the commencement of any voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy, reorganization or insolvency case, filing, petition,
application, plan of arrangement or proceeding of or against any Borrower or any Guarantor (or, if interest on any portion of the Obligations ceases to accrue by operation of law by reason of the commencement of such case, filing, petition,
application, plan of arrangement or proceeding, such interest as would have accrued on such portion of the Obligations if such case, filing, petition, application, plan of arrangement or proceeding had not been commenced) shall be included in the
Obligations because it is the intention of the Guarantors and the Secured Parties that the Obligations which are guaranteed by the Guarantors pursuant hereto should be determined without regard to any rule of law or order which may relieve any
Borrower of any portion of such Obligations. The Guarantors will permit any trustee in bankruptcy, receiver, administrative receiver, interim receiver, receiver and manager, administrator, custodian, sequestrator, conservator, controller, debtor in
possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors or similar person to pay the Administrative Agent, or allow the claim of the Administrative Agent in respect of, any such interest accruing after the date on which such case, filing, petition,
application, plan of arrangement or proceeding is commenced.  (c) If acceleration of the time for payment of any amount payable by any
Borrower under the Credit Agreement or by any Borrower or any Guarantor under any other Loan Document is stayed upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of such Borrower or such Guarantor, all such amounts otherwise subject to acceleration
under the terms of the Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document 
  - 5 - 



shall nonetheless be payable by each of the other Guarantors hereunder forthwith on demand by the Administrative Agent unless also stayed in connection with the insolvency, bankruptcy or
reorganization of such Guarantor.  SECTION 1.06. Reinstatement. Each Guarantor agrees that its guarantee hereunder
shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party upon the insolvency,
dissolution, liquidation, bankruptcy or reorganization of any Borrower, any other Loan Party, the appointment of a receiver, administrative receiver, interim receiver, receiver and manager, administrator, liquidator, statutory manager, trustee,
custodian, sequestrator, conservator or any similar official or otherwise.  SECTION 1.07. Agreement To Pay;
Subrogation. In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right that the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party has at law or in equity against any Guarantor by virtue hereof, upon the failure of any Borrower or
any other Loan Party to pay any Obligation when and as the same shall become due and payable, whether at maturity, by acceleration, after notice of prepayment or otherwise, each Guarantor hereby promises to and will forthwith pay, or cause to be
paid, to the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, for distribution to the applicable Secured Parties in cash the amount of such unpaid Obligation plus any accrued and unpaid interest on such Obligation (including interest
which, but for any Borrowers becoming the subject of a case, filing, petition, application, plan of arrangement under any Debtor Relief Law, would have accrued on such Obligations whether or not such claim is allowed against any Borrower for
such interest in the related case, filing, petition, application, plan of arrangement). Upon payment by any Guarantor of any sums to the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, as provided above, all rights of such Guarantor
against any Borrower or any other Guarantor arising as a result thereof by way of right of subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or otherwise shall in all respects be subject to Article II. 
SECTION 1.08. Information. Each Guarantor assumes all responsibility for being and keeping itself informed of each
Borrowers and each other Loan Partys financial condition and assets and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Obligations and the nature, scope and extent of the risks that such Guarantor assumes and
incurs hereunder, and agrees that neither the Collateral Agent nor any other Secured Party will have any duty to advise such Guarantor of information known to it or any of them regarding such circumstances or risks. 
SECTION 1.09. Instrument for the Payment of Money. Each Guarantor hereby acknowledges that the guarantee in this Article I
constitutes an instrument for the payment of money, and consents and agrees that any Lender, the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, at its sole option, in the event of a dispute by such Guarantor in the payment of any moneys due
hereunder, shall have the right to bring a motion-action under New York CPLR Section 3213.  SECTION 1.10. General
Limitation on Guarantee Obligations. In any action or proceeding involving any state corporate, limited partnership or limited liability company law, or any applicable state, provincial, territorial, federal or foreign bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization or other law affecting the rights of creditors generally, if the obligations of any Guarantor under Section 1.01 would otherwise be held or determined to be void, voidable, invalid or unenforceable, or subordinated to
the claims of any other creditors, on account of the amount of its liability under Section 1.01, then, notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, the amount of such liability shall, without any further action by such Guarantor, any
Loan Party or any other person, be automatically limited and reduced to the highest amount (after giving effect to the right of contribution established in Section 2.02) that is valid and enforceable and not subordinated to the claims of other
creditors as determined in such action or proceeding.

(a) Guarantors incorporated in England and Wales. This guarantee does not apply to any liability of a Guarantor incorporated in
England & Wales to the extent that it would result in this guarantee constituting unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of sections 677, 678 or 679 of the Companies Act 2006 or any equivalent provision of any applicable law. 
(b) Guarantors incorporated in Luxembourg. 
(i) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Agreement or any other Loan Document, the aggregate amounts of the
guarantee obligations under this Agreement of any guarantor incorporated in Luxembourg (a Luxembourg Guarantor) for the obligations of any other Loan Party which is not a direct or indirect subsidiary of such Luxembourg
Guarantor (the Luxembourg Guarantee Obligations), shall be limited at any time, with no double counting, to an aggregate amount not exceeding the greater of: 
(A) (x) ninety percent (90%) of such Luxembourg Guarantors own funds (capitaux propres) as referred to in
article 34 of the Luxembourg act dated 19 December 2002 (the 2002 Law) concerning the trade and companies register and the accounting and annual accounts of undertakings, as amended (the Own
Funds), increased by (y) any amounts owed by such Luxembourg Guarantor to any affiliated entity and that have not been financed (directly or indirectly) by the Credit Agreement and (without double-counting) and any subordinated
liabilities as referred to in 2002 Law; each as reflected in the most recent available financial statements of such Luxembourg Guarantor as on the date of this Agreement; or 
(B) (x) ninety percent (90%) of such Luxembourg Guarantors Own Funds increased by (y) any amounts owed by such
Luxembourg Guarantor to any affiliated entity and that have not been financed (directly or indirectly) by the Credit Agreement and (without double-counting) and any subordinated liabilities as referred to in 2002 Law; each as reflected in the most
recent available financial statements of such Luxembourg Guarantor as on the date of demand of payment of the guarantee under this Agreement. 
(ii) The limitation in clause (i) above shall not apply to the extent that the obligations or liabilities assumed by such
Luxembourg Guarantor under this Agreement relate to any amounts borrowed or made available, in any form whatsoever, under the Loan Documents to such Luxembourg Guarantor or any of its (current or future) direct or indirect subsidiaries.

(d) Guarantors incorporated in Germany. 
(i) The Secured Parties shall be entitled to enforce the Guarantee against each Guarantor incorporated and existing under the
laws of Germany as a company with limited liability (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung) (each a German Guarantor) without limitation in respect of: 
(A) any and all amounts which are owed under the Obligations directly (i.e. as a result of borrowing or other direct liability
under the Loan Documents, thus excluding any secondary liability under joint and several liability, guarantee or indemnity) by the German Guarantor itself or by any of its direct or indirect Subsidiaries; and 
(B) any and all amounts which correspond to funds which have been borrowed under any of the Loan Documents to the extent on-lent or otherwise passed on to, or issued for the benefit of, the German Guarantor or any of its direct or indirect Subsidiaries, or for the benefit of any of their creditors and in each case not repaid and
outstanding from time to time; and  (C) any and all amounts for which an enforcement is not limited by paragraphs
(ii) through (xi) below.  (ii) The Secured Parties shall not be entitled to enforce the Guarantee against a German
Guarantor, to the extent that:  (A) the enforcement of the Guarantee would result in a repayment of the obligations of a
Loan Party which is (i) a shareholder of the German Guarantor or (ii) an affiliated company in which a shareholder of the German Guarantor (other than the German Guarantor itself and any of its direct or indirect Subsidiaries) directly or
indirectly holds any shares, provided that such enforcement would be regarded as a payment (Auszahlung) by the German Guarantor to a shareholder of the German Guarantor within the meaning of section 30 of the German Act on Companies with
Limited Liability (GmbHG) (as amended from time to time); and  (B) the German Guarantor as dependent
(abhängig) and/or profit transferring (gewinnabführend) company has not entered into a domination and/or profit and loss transfer agreement (Beherrschungs- und/oder Gewinnabführungsvertrag) with such shareholder
or affiliate; and  (C) the enforcement of the Guarantee would (i) have the effect of reducing the German
Guarantors net assets (Reinvermögen) (hereinafter: Net Assets) to an amount of less than its registered share capital or, if the Net Assets are already an amount of less than its registered share capital,
of causing such amount to be further reduced and (ii) thereby affect the assets required for the mandatory preservation of the German Guarantors registered share capital according to section 30 of the German Act on Companies with Limited
Liability (GmbHG) (as amended from time to time), provided that the amount of the 
  - 8 - 



registered share capital to be taken into account shall be the amount registered in the commercial register as at the date hereof (or if lower, such amount at any date hereafter) and only to the
extent that it is actually paid in, and any increase of the registered share capital after the date of this Agreement shall only be taken into account if such increase has been effected with the prior written consent of the Secured Parties. 
(iii) The Net Assets shall be calculated as an amount equal to the sum of the book values of the German Guarantors assets
(consisting of all assets which correspond to the items set forth in section 266 sub-section (2) A, B and C of the German Commercial Code (HGB)) less the aggregate amount of the German
Guarantors liabilities (consisting of all liabilities and liability reserves which correspond to the items set forth in section 266 sub-section (3) B, C and D of the German Commercial Code
(HGB)), provided that:  (A) obligations under loans or other liabilities incurred by the German Guarantor which
(i) are subordinated within the meaning of section 39 paragraph 2 of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) or (ii) have been incurred in violation of the provisions of the Loan Documents, shall (in each case) not be taken
into account as liabilities; and  (B) the book values shall be determined in accordance with the generally accepted
accounting principles applicable from time to time in Germany (Grundsätze ordnungsgemäßer Buchfuhrüng) and be based on the same principles which were applied by the German Guarantor in the preparation of its (at the time
in question) most recent annual commercial law balance sheet (handelsbilanzielle Jahresbilanz).  (iv) If the
Guarantee cannot be fully enforced against the German Guarantor due to the limitations in Section 1.11, the German Guarantor shall, upon request of the Collateral Agent, dispose or otherwise realise, to the extent legally permitted and in order
to enable the Secured Parties to enforce the Guarantee in full or with less limitations, any and all of its assets which are not required for the German Guarantors business (nicht betriebsnotwendig) and where the book value
(Buchwert) of such asset or assets shown in the most recent annual commercial law balance sheet (handelsbilanzielle Jahresbilanz) is significantly lower than the market value of the asset or assets, within a time period reasonably
required in order to dispose or otherwise realise any such asset or assets.  (v) If the Guarantee cannot be fully enforced
against the German Guarantor due to the limitations in Section 1.11, the German Guarantor shall, to the extent that the German Guarantor is legally permitted to do so and in order to enable the Secured Parties to enforce the Guarantee in full
or with less limitations, take all measures (including, without limitation, setting-off claims or dissolution of hidden reserves) requested by the Collateral Agent to increase the amount of Net Assets. 
(vi) Without prejudice to paragraph (vii) below, the enforcement of the Guarantee shall only be limited pursuant to
paragraph (ii) above if the German Guarantor delivers to the Collateral Agent, without undue delay:  (A) but no later
than within 20 Business Days after receipt of a request for payment under the Guarantee by a Secured Party, a notice in writing specifying: 
I. to what extent the Guarantee should not be enforced under paragraph (ii) above; and 
  - 9 - 


II. the amounts which would, if the Guarantee were enforced, have the effect of
(x) reducing the German Guarantors Net Assets to an amount of less than its registered share capital or, if the Net Assets are already an amount of less than its registered share capital, of causing such amount to be further reduced and
(y) thereby affecting the assets required for the mandatory preservation of the German Guarantors registered share capital in accordance with section 30 of the German Act on Companies with Limited Liability (GmbHG) (as amended from
time to time),  and provides with such notice sufficient supporting evidence, including, without limitation, an up-to-date pro forma balance sheet and a detailed calculation of the Net Assets in accordance with paragraphs (ii) to (v) above (the Management
Determination);  (B) but not later than within 45 Business Days after receipt of a request for payment under
the Guarantee by a Secured Party, an up-to-date balance sheet prepared by a firm of auditors of international standard and reputation which shows the value of the German
Guarantors Net Assets (hereinafter: Balance Sheet). The Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance with the principles set out in paragraph (iii) above and shall contain additional information (in reasonable
detail) relating to items to be adjusted pursuant to paragraph (iii) above.  (vii) If a Secured Party has enforced the
Guarantee without limitation because the Management Determination and/or the Balance Sheet was not delivered or not delivered within the applicable time, the relevant Secured Party shall, upon written demand of the German Guarantor, repay to the
German Guarantor any amount which pursuant to the Management Determination and/or the Balance Sheet has been enforced in excess, provided that (a) such Management Determination and/or the Balance Sheet also confirms that, at such later point in
time the application of paragraph (ii) above would result in a limitation of the amount enforceable under the Guarantee and (b) such Management Determination and/or Balance Sheet is delivered not later than an additional 20 Business Days
after it should have been delivered. For the avoidance of doubt, a Secured Party is entitled, in any event, to enforce the Guarantee without limitation to the extent enforcement is not restricted based on the Management Determination and/or the
Balance Sheet.  (viii) If a Secured Party disagrees with the Management Determination and/or the Balance Sheet, it shall
notify the relevant German Guarantor accordingly. The Secured Party shall be entitled to enforce the Guarantee and to apply the proceeds to settle its claims without limitation up to the amount which is undisputed between it and the relevant German
Guarantor. In relation to the amount which is disputed by the relevant Secured Party, the Secured Party shall be entitled to further pursue its claims under the Guarantee if and to the extent that an up-to-date balance sheet prepared by a firm of auditors of international standard and reputation opposing the Balance Sheet (hereinafter: Opposing Balance Sheet) shows that the
limitations under paragraph (ii) result in a higher enforceable amount under the Guarantee. The Opposing Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance with the principles set out in paragraph (iii) above. 
  - 10 - 


(ix) In relation to any amounts exceeding the amount which according to the
Management Determination, the Balance Sheet and, as the case may be, the Opposing Balance Sheet can be enforced in compliance with the limitations set out in paragraph (ii) above for which the German Guarantors are liable under the Guarantee, a
Secured Party shall be entitled to further pursue its claims (if any) after expiry of three (3) months from the date the Balance Sheet was delivered to the Secured Party. However, the relevant German Guarantor is entitled to prove that this
amount is still necessary for maintaining its registered share capital (calculated as of the date the demand under this Guarantee was made (or if lower at any later date)). 
(x) The limitations set out in paragraph (ii) above shall not apply: 
(A) if and to the extent that, despite being in a position to take measures as described in paragraphs (iv) and/or
(v) and requested by a Secured Party or the Collateral Agent, the German Guarantor delays or fails to take such measures; or 
(B) if, at the time the Guarantee is enforced, the limitations set out in paragraph (ii) above are no longer required in
order to protect the managing directors of the German Guarantor from incurring any personal liability exposure due to an enforcement of the Guarantee with respect a breach of Section 30 of the German Act on Companies with Limited Liability
(GmbHG) (as amended from time to time).  No reduction of the amount enforceable under the Guarantee shall prejudice the right of a Secured
Party to continue enforcing this Guarantee (subject always to the operation of the limitations set out above at the time of such enforcement) until there has been full and irrevocable satisfaction of all claims under the Guarantee. 
(e) Guarantors incorporated in France. 
(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article I, the liability of any French Guarantor in its capacity as a
Guarantor is subject to the following limitations:   


 
(A)
the obligations and liabilities of any French Guarantor under the Loan Documents and in particular under Article I of this Agreement shall not include any obligation or liability which if incurred would constitute the
provision of unlawful financial assistance (assistance financière prohibée) within the meaning of article L. 225-216 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and/or would
constitute a majority shareholding misuse or a misuse of corporate assets within the meaning of articles L. 241-3, L. 242-6 or L.
244-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) or any other laws or regulations having the same effect, as interpreted by French courts; 
 


 
(B)
the obligations and the liabilities of any French Guarantor under Article I of this Agreement for the obligations under the Loan 
  - 11 - 




 

Documents of any other Obligor which is not a subsidiary of that French Guarantor, shall be limited to an amount equal to the difference between: 
 


 
I.
the aggregate of all amounts borrowed directly or indirectly under the Agreement by such other Obligor as Borrower to the extent directly or indirectly on-lent or otherwise
provided by such Borrower to that French Guarantor and/or its Subsidiaries under inter-company loan agreements or similar arrangements and outstanding at the date a payment is to be made by that French Guarantor under Clause 21.1 (Guarantee and
indemnity) of this Agreement; and   


 
II.
the aggregate of all the amounts already received by the Lender from the French Guarantor pursuant to Clause 21.1 (Guarantee and indemnity); 
 


 
(C)
the obligations and the liabilities of the French Guarantor under Article I of this Agreement for the obligations under the Loan Documents of any Guarantor which is its subsidiary shall not, in relation to amounts due
by such Guarantor as a borrower, be limited and shall therefore cover all amounts due by such Guarantor as a borrower and shall cover, in relation to amounts due by such Guarantor as a Guarantor, all amounts due by such Guarantor as a Guarantor
subject to the limitations set out in paragraphs (A) and (B) above as if the same applied mutatis mutandis to such Guarantor.   


 
(D)
For the avoidance of doubt, it is acknowledged that each French Guarantor shall not be considered as co-débiteur solidaire as to their obligations
pursuant it the guarantees given in accordance with this Section 1.11(e).  (f) Guarantors incorporated in Spain. This
guarantee does not apply to any liability to the extent that it would result in this guarantee constituting unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of Articles 143 and 150 of the Spanish Royal Legislative Decree 1/2010, of 2 July,
approving the consolidated text of the companies law or any equivalent provision of any applicable law.  (g) Guarantors incorporated in
Switzerland. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document, if and to the extent that (i) any Guarantor incorporated in Switzerland (a Swiss Guarantor) becomes liable under this
Agreement or any Loan Document, or any security granted by the Swiss Guarantor under this Agreement or any Loan Document is enforced, for obligations of such Swiss Guarantors Affiliates which are not direct or indirect subsidiaries wholly
owned by the Pledgor (the Restricted Obligations) and (ii) discharging such liability, or using the proceeds of the enforcement of such security toward satisfaction of the Restricted Obligations, would constitute a repayment
of capital (Einlagerückgewähr), a violation of the legally protected reserves (gesetzlich geschütze Reserven) or the payment of a (constructive) dividend (Gewinnausschüttung) by the Swiss Guarantor, or would
otherwise be restricted under Swiss law then applicable, then the aggregate liability of the Swiss Guarantor for the Restricted Obligations shall be limited to the amount of (unrestricted) equity of the Swiss Guarantor which is available for
distribution as dividends under the Swiss law (including retained earnings, current net profits, and the reserves available for distribution) at the time the payment of the Restricted Obligations is requested from the Swiss Guarantor (the
Maximum Amount), provided that such limitation shall not release the Swiss Guarantor from its liability in excess of the Maximum Amount, but that it shall merely postpone the performance date thereof until such time or
times as performance is again permitted. 
  - 12 - 


If any payment made in respect to Restricted Obligations under this Agreement or any Loan
Document is subject to the tax imposed pursuant the Swiss Federal Act on Withholding Tax of 13 October 1965 (Bundesgesetz über die Verrechnungssteuer vom 13 Oktober 1965) as amended from time to time (Swiss Witholding
Tax), the Swiss Guarantor shall:  (i) mitigate to the maximum extent possible any Swiss Withholding Tax to be
levied on any payment made in respect to Restricted Obligations under this Agreement or any Loan Document (and cause its shareholder and other relevant Affiliates to fully cooperate in any mitigating efforts) by discharging the Swiss Withholding Tax
liability through the notification procedure pursuant to applicable law (including tax treaties); and/or, if the notification procedure referred to in this paragraph (i). is not (fully) applicable, 
(ii) deduct from the payment made in respect to Restricted Obligations the Swiss Withholding Tax at the relevant then
applicable rate and timely pay any such deduction to the Swiss Federal Tax Administration; and  (iii) promptly notify the
Collateral Agent that the notification and/or, as the case may be, the deduction has (have) been made and paid to the Swiss Federal Tax Administration and provide evidence thereof. 
To the extent Swiss Withholding Tax is deducted from payment made in respect to Restricted Obligations, the Swiss Guarantor shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that any person which is, as a result of a deduction of Swiss Withholding Tax, entitled to a full or partial refund of the Swiss Withholding Tax, will, as soon as possible after the deduction of the Swiss
Withholding Tax, (i) request a refund of the Swiss Withholding Tax under any applicable law (including double tax treaties) and (ii) promptly upon receipt, pay to the Collateral Agent (or to any such other person as directed by the
Collateral Agent) any amount so refunded for application as a further payment under this Agreement or any other relevant Loan Document. 
If and to the extent requested by the Collateral Agent and if and to the extent this is from time to time required under Swiss law rules
(restricting profit distributions), in order to allow the Collateral Agent and the Secured Parties to obtain a maximum benefit under this Agreement or any other relevant Loan Document, the Swiss Guarantor and any other relevant party to this
Agreement shall (and shall cause their shareholders and other relevant Affiliates to) promptly implement all such measures and/or promptly procure the fulfilment of all prerequisites allowing payment(s) made under this Agreement or any other
relevant Loan Document in respect to Restricted Obligations from time to time, including the following:  (i) preparation of
an up-to-date (interim) audited balance sheet of the Swiss Guarantor; 
(ii) to the extent possible and/or necessary, confirmation of the auditors of the Swiss Guarantor that the relevant amount
represents the maximum amount available for distribution;  (iii) to the maximum extent permitted by Swiss law, conversion
of restricted reserves into profits, reserves and/or other equity account freely available for the distribution as dividends; 
(iv) to the maximum extent permitted by Swiss law, revaluation of hidden reserves; 
  - 13 - 


(v) passing of a shareholder resolution approving the distribution; and 
(vi) all such other measures necessary or useful to allow the Swiss Guarantor to make the payments agreed hereunder with a
minimum of limitations.  SECTION 1.12. Additional Jurisdictions. In the event that a Subsidiary is to become a party to
this Guarantee as required by Section 5.10 of the Credit Agreement or otherwise and at such time such additional Guarantor is not organized in one of the jurisdictions of a Guarantor that is or has already been a signatory hereto, then the
Guarantor Supplement to be executed and delivered by such additional Guarantor shall include guarantee limitation provisions, corporate benefit, tax and other provisions customary for such jurisdiction as the Administrative Agent, the Collateral
Agent and such additional Guarantor may reasonably agree based on the advice of legal counsel (which may be legal counsel for such Guarantor). 
SECTION 1.13. Release. (a)On the Maturity Date, this Agreement and all obligations (other than those expressly stated to
survive the Maturity Date) of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and each Guarantor hereunder shall terminate, all without delivery of any instrument or performance of any act by any party. At the request and sole expense of any
Guarantor following any such termination, the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent shall execute and deliver to such Guarantor (or any of its agents, officers or designees) such documents as such Guarantor (or any of its agents, officers or
designees) shall reasonably request to evidence such termination.  (b) At the request and sole expense of the Guarantors, a Guarantor
shall be released from its obligations hereunder if such Guarantor ceases to be a Subsidiary as a result of a transaction permitted under the Credit Agreement in accordance with Section 6.05 of the Credit Agreement; provided that, upon
the reasonable request of the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, Holdings shall have delivered to the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent a certification by the Company stating that such transaction is in compliance with the
Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents.  SECTION 1.14. Continuing Guarantee. The guarantee created under this
Agreement is a continuing guarantee and will extend to the ultimate balance of sums payable by any Loan Party under the Loan Documents, regardless of any intermediate payment or discharge in whole or in part. 
SECTION 1.15. Additional Security. The guarantee created under this Agreement is in addition to and is not in any way
prejudiced by any other guarantee or security now or subsequently held by any Secured Party.  ARTICLE III 
NDEMNITY, SUBROGATION AND SUBORDINATION 
SECTION 2.01. Indemnity and Subrogation.  
(a) In addition to all such rights of indemnity and subrogation as the Guarantors may have under applicable law (but subject to
Section 2.03), each Borrower agrees that (i) in the event a payment shall be made by any Guarantor under this Agreement, such Borrower shall indemnify such Guarantor for the full amount of such payment and such Guarantor shall be
subrogated to the rights of the person to whom such payment shall have been made to the extent of such payment and (ii) in the event any assets of any Guarantor shall be sold pursuant to this Agreement or any other Security Document to satisfy
in whole or in part a claim of any Secured Party, such Borrower shall indemnify such Guarantor in an amount equal to the fair market value of the assets so sold. 
  - 14 - 


(b) If any amount shall be paid to any Guarantor on account of such subrogation rights at any
time when all of the Obligations (other than those expressly stated to survive the Maturity Date) shall not have been paid in full, such amount shall be held by such Guarantor in trust for the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, segregated from
other funds of such Guarantor, and shall, forthwith upon receipt by such Guarantor, be turned over to the Administrative Agent in the exact form received by such Guarantor (duly indorsed by such Guarantor to the Administrative Agent, if required by
applicable law), to be applied against the Borrower Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in the order set forth in Section 7.02 of the Credit Agreement. 
SECTION 2.02. Contribution and Subrogation. 
(a) Each Guarantor (a Contributing Guarantor) agrees (subject to Section 2.03) that, in the event a payment
shall be made by any other Guarantor hereunder in respect of any Obligation, or assets of any other Guarantor shall be sold pursuant to any Security Document to satisfy any Obligation owed to any Secured Party, and such other Guarantor (a
Claiming Guarantor) shall not have been fully indemnified by any Borrower as provided in Section 2.01, such Contributing Guarantor shall indemnify such Claiming Guarantor in an amount equal to (i) the amount of
such payment or (ii) the fair market value of such assets, as the case may be, in each case multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the net worth of the Contributing Guarantor (as determined immediately prior to such payment or
sale) and the denominator shall be the aggregate net worth of all the Guarantors (as determined immediately prior to such payment or sale). Any Contributing Guarantor making any payment to a Claiming Guarantor pursuant to this Section 2.02
shall be subrogated to the rights of such Claiming Guarantor under Section 2.01 to the extent of such payment.  (b) The obligations
of the Guarantors under the Loan Documents, including their liability for the Obligations and the enforceability of the security interests granted thereby, are not contingent upon the validity, legality, enforceability, collectability or sufficiency
of any right of contribution or subrogation arising under this Article II. To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, the invalidity, insufficiency, unenforceability or uncollectability of any such right shall not in any respect diminish,
affect or impair any such obligation or any other claim, interest, right or remedy at any time held by any Secured Party against any Guarantor or its property. The Secured Parties make no representations or warranties in respect of any such right
and shall, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, have no duty to assure, protect, enforce or ensure any such right or otherwise relating to any such right. 
SECTION 2.03. Subordination. 
(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, all rights of the Guarantors under Sections 2.01 and 2.02 and all other
rights of indemnity, contribution or subrogation under applicable law or otherwise shall be fully subordinated to the indefeasible payment in full in cash of the Obligations (other than those expressly stated to survive the Maturity Date). No
failure on the part of any Borrower or any Guarantor to make the payments required by Sections 2.01 and 2.02 (or any other payments required under applicable law or otherwise) shall in any respect limit the obligations and liabilities of any
Guarantor with respect to its obligations hereunder, and each Guarantor shall remain liable for the full amount of its obligations hereunder. 
(b) Each Borrower and each other Guarantor hereby agree that all Indebtedness and other monetary obligations owed to it by any Borrower or any
Subsidiary shall be fully subordinated to the indefeasible payment in full in cash of the Obligations (other than those expressly stated to survive the Maturity Date).

ARTICLE III 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES 
To induce the Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent and the Lenders to enter into the Credit Agreement and to induce the Lenders to make
their respective extensions of credit to the Borrowers thereunder, each Guarantor hereby represents and warrants to the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and each Lender that the representations set forth in Article III of the Credit
Agreement are, with respect to such Guarantor, true and correct in all material respects (without duplication of materiality qualifiers contained therein) on and as of the date hereof, except to the extent such representations and warranties
expressly relate to an earlier date, in which case they shall be true and correct in all material respects (without duplication of materiality qualifiers contained therein) as of such earlier date. Each Guarantor hereby acknowledges and confirms
that as of the Closing Date, it has received and reviewed the terms of the Credit Agreement.  ARTICLE IV 
MISCELLANEOUS 
SECTION 4.01. Notices. All communications and notices hereunder shall (except as otherwise expressly permitted herein) be
in writing and given as provided in Section 9.01 of the Credit Agreement.  SECTION 4.02. Survival of Agreement.
All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the Loan Parties in the Loan Documents and in the certificates or other instruments prepared or delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document
shall be considered to have been relied upon by the Lenders and shall survive the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents and the making of any Loans, regardless of any investigation made by any Lender or on its behalf and notwithstanding that
the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended under the Credit Agreement, and shall continue in full force and
effect until the Maturity Date.  SECTION 4.03. Binding Effect; Several Agreement. This Agreement shall become effective
as to any Loan Party when a counterpart hereof executed on behalf of such Loan Party shall have been delivered to the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent and a counterpart hereof shall have been executed on behalf of the Administrative
Agent and the Collateral Agent, and thereafter shall be binding upon such Loan Party, the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent and their respective permitted successors, indorsees, transferees and assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of
such Loan Party, the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and the other Secured Parties and their respective successors and assigns, except that no Loan Party shall have the right to assign or transfer its rights or obligations hereunder or
any interest herein or in the Collateral (and any such assignment or transfer shall be void) except as expressly contemplated or permitted by the Security Documents or the Credit Agreement. This Agreement shall be construed as a separate agreement
with respect to each Loan Party and may be amended, modified, supplemented, waived or released with respect to any Loan Party without the approval of any other Loan Party and without affecting the obligations of any other Loan Party hereunder. 
SECTION 4.04. Successors and Assigns. Whenever in this Agreement any of the parties hereto is referred to, such reference
shall be deemed to include the permitted successors and assigns of such party; and all covenants, promises and agreements by or on behalf of any Guarantor, the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent that are contained in this Agreement shall

SECTION 4.05. Applicable Law. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF
THE PARTIES HEREUNDER SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.  SECTION
4.06. Waivers; Amendment.  (a) No failure or delay by the Collateral Agent, the Administrative Agent or any Lender in
exercising any right or power hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver hereof or thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such
a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Collateral Agent, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are
cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of any Loan Document or consent to any departure by any Loan Party therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall
be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section 4.06, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a
Loan shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time. No notice or demand on any Loan Party in any
case shall entitle any Loan Party to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.  (b) Neither this Agreement
nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Loan Party or Loan Parties with respect to which such waiver,
amendment or modification is to apply, subject to any consent required in accordance with Section 9.08 of the Credit Agreement. 
SECTION 4.07. Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY
RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS. EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE,
AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS, AS APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 4.07. 
SECTION 4.08. Severabilit

ts, for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of any New York State court or federal court of the United States of America sitting in the Borough of Manhattan, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any
such action or proceeding shall be heard and determined in such New York State or, to the extent permitted by law, in such federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan, and any appellate court from any thereof. Each of the parties hereto agrees
that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall affect
any right that the Collateral Agent, the Administrative Agent or any Lender may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any Collateral against any Guarantor or its properties in the
courts of any jurisdiction.  (b) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may
legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents in any New York State or federal court
sitting in the Borough of Manhattan, and any appellate court from any thereof. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or
proceeding in any such court.  (c) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably designates, appoints and empowers Corporation Service
Company (whose current address is: 80 State Street, Albany, New York 12207-2543, U.S.A.) (including any replacement agent as provided below, the Process Agent), in the case of any suit, action or proceeding brought in the
United States of America as its designee, appointee and agent to receive, accept and acknowledge for and on its behalf, and in respect of its property, service of any and all legal process, summons, notices and documents that may be served in any
action or proceeding arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document. Such service may be made by mailing (by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid) or delivering a copy of such process to such person in care
of the Process Agent at the Process Agents above address, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably authorizes and directs the Process Agent to accept such service on its behalf. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of the
Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent to serve process in any other manner permitted by law. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a failure by the Process Agent for service of process to notify the relevant Guarantor of the process will
not invalidate the proceedings concerned. 
  - 18 - 


SECTION 4.12. Additional Subsidiaries. Each Subsidiary that is required to
become a party to this Agreement pursuant to Section 5.10 of the Credit Agreement shall become a Guarantor, with the same force and effect as if originally named as a Guarantor herein, for all purposes of this Guarantee, upon execution and
delivery by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and such Subsidiary of a supplement in the form of Exhibit A hereto (the Guarantor Supplement). The execution and delivery of any such instrument shall not require
the consent of any other Loan Party hereunder. The rights and obligations of each Loan Party hereunder shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding the addition of any new Loan Party as a party to this Agreement. 
SECTION 4.13. Conflicts. In the event of any conflict between the provisions contained herein and the provisions contained
in the Credit Agreement, the provisions contained in the Credit Agreement shall control.  SECTION 4.14. Set-Off. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender may, with the prior written consent of the Required Lenders and the Administrative Agent (provided that no such
consent shall be required if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing pursuant to Section 7.01(h) or (i) of the Credit Agreement), at any time and from time to time, except to the extent prohibited by law, to set off and apply
any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender to or for the credit or the account of any Guarantor against any of and all the obligations of
such Guarantor then due and payable, now or hereafter existing under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents held by such Lender, irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement or such other Loan
Document. The applicable Lender shall endeavor to notify the relevant Guarantor and the Administrative Agent of such setoff; provided that the failure to provide such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff or application under
this Section 4.15. The rights of each Lender under this Section 4.14 are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which such Lender may have. 
SECTION 4.15. Expenses; Indemnification. Each Guarantor as principal obligor and as a separate and independent obligation
and liability from its obligations and liabilities under Article I agrees to the expense reimbursement and indemnification provisions of Section 9.05 of the Credit Agreement as if such provisions were incorporated herein, mutatis
mutandis.  SECTION 4.16. English Agreement. The parties hereto confirm that it is their wish that this Agreement,
as well as any other documents relating to this Agreement, including notices, schedules and authorizations, have been and shall be drawn up in the English language only, other than that established in Section 4.17 in relation to the Spanish
translation of the Agreement.  SECTION 4.17. Special Provisions on Spanish Enforcement Procedures. 
(a) Notarisation and translation. 
The Borrowers and the Guarantors undertake to notarise this Agreement (as well as any amendment or supplemental agreement to it) in a Spanish
public deed on the date falling ten Business Days from the Administrative Agents request.  The Borrowers and the Guarantors
undertake to provide a Spanish sworn translation (at their cost) into Spanish this Agreement to the satisfaction of the Administrative Agent within ten (1) Business Days from the Administrative Agents request. 
  - 19 - 


(b) Accounts of the Administrative Agent and of the Lenders. 
(i) For the purposes of enforcing the provisions of, or foreclosing under, this Agreement pursuant to Spanish law (including,
without limitation, the guarantee provided by each Guarantor), the Administrative Agent, in its capacity as such (and on behalf of the Lenders), shall open and maintain a special account in its books on behalf of the Borrowers and/or the Guarantors,
from which all interest, fees, expenses, default interest, additional costs and any other amounts that the Borrowers and/or the Guarantors owe to the Lenders under the Loan Documents will be debited and into which all amounts received by or on
account of the Lenders from the Borrowers and/or the Guarantors under the Loan Documents will be credited, so that the balance of the credit account represents the amount owed from time to time by the Borrowers and/or the Guarantors to the Lenders
under the Loan Documents.  (ii) In addition to the accounting account referred to in paragraph (i) above, each Lender
shall open and maintain a special account in its records equivalent to that referred to in paragraph (i) above, into which the interest, fees, expenses, default interest, additional costs and any other amounts that the Borrowers and/or the
Guarantors owe to the Lender under the Loan Documents will be debited and into which all amounts received by the Lender from the Borrowers and/or the Guarantors under the Finance Documents shall be credited, so that the sum of the balance of the
credit account represents the amount owed from time to time by the Borrowers and/or the Guarantors to the Lender under the Loan Documents. In the event of assignment of the Loan or any Loan Document, the assignor will totally or partially cancel the
referenced accounts, with corresponding accounts to be opened by the assignee.  (iii) In the event of any discrepancy
between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent corresponding to such matters, the Administrative Agents accounts and records will take precedence in the absence of manifest
error.  (c) Determination of outstanding balance. 
(i) If any Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Administrative Agent will settle the accounts referred to in Sections
(a) and (b) above. For the purposes of enforcement in judicial or extrajudicial proceedings, it is expressly agreed that the balance of the accounts referred to in Sections (b)(i) and (b)(ii) above resulting from the certification for that
purpose issued by the Administrative Agent will be deemed a liquid, due and payable amount enforceable against the Borrowers and/or the Guarantors, provided that it is evidenced in a notarial document that the settlement was made in the form agreed
by the parties in this agreement as duly formalized under an enforceable instrument (título ejecutivo) and that the outstanding balance is equivalent to that recording in the corresponding account of the Borrowers and/or Guarantors
opened in connection with the Credit Agreement.  (ii) The Administrative Agent shall give advance notice to the Parent of
the amount due as a result of the settlement.  (d) Enforcement. 
(i) In the event that the Secured Parties decide to commence the ordinary enforcement proceedings contemplated under articles 517 et seq. of
the Spanish Law 1/2000, of 7 January, on civil procedure, the Parties expressly agree for the purposes of articles 571 et seq. of the Spanish Law 1/2000, of 7 January, on civil procedure that the settlement to determine the enforceable due
debt (deuda ejecutivamente reclamable) will be carried out by the Administrative Agent. Therefore, the following will be sufficient for the commencement of summary proceedings: 
 


 
(A)
an executory copy (copia autorizada de la escritura matriz con carácter ejecutivo) of the notarial instrument notarizing this Agreement under a Spanish public deed or public instrument (póliza
mercantile); 
  - 20 - 




 
(B)
a certificate, issued by the Administrative Agent of the debt for which the Borrowers and/or the Guarantors are liable, which shall include an extract of the debit and credit entries and the entries corresponding to the
application of interest that determine the specific balance for which enforcement is requested;   


 
(C)
the document evidencing (documento fehaciente) that the settlement of the debt has been carried out in the form agreed in this Agreement; and 
 


 
(D)
a certified document evidencing the service of prior notice to the Borrowers (on behalf of all Guarantors) of the amount due as a result of the settlement. 
(ii) All taxes, expenses and duties that accrue or incurred by reason of the notarial instruments referred to in this
Section 4.17 will be satisfied by the Borrowers and the Guarantors.  [Remainder of page intentionally left blank]

(Holdings) and CLAIRES GERMANY GMBH (together with Holdings, each, a Borrower and collectively, the Borrowers), each of the Subsidiaries listed on the signature
pages thereto or that becomes a party thereto pursuant to Section 4.12 thereof (each a Subsidiary Guarantor and, collectively, the Subsidiary Guarantors; the Subsidiary Guarantors and each
Borrower (in its capacity as a Guarantor thereunder) are referred to collectively as the Guarantors), BOTTICELLI LLC, as administrative agent for the Lenders (in such capacity, including any successor thereto, the
Administrative Agent), and CORTLAND CAPITAL MARKET SERVICES LLC, as collateral agent for the Secured Parties (in such capacity, including any successor thereto, the Collateral Agent). 
A. Reference is made to the Credit Agreement, dated as of January 5, 2017 (as amended, restated, amended and restated, supplemented or
otherwise modified from time to time, the Credit Agreement), among the Borrowers, the lenders from time to time party thereto (the Lenders), the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent. 
B. Capitalized terms used herein (including in this preamble) and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to such terms
in the Credit Agreement or the Guarantee, as applicable.  C. The Guarantors have entered into the Guarantee in order to induce the Lenders
to make the Loans. Section 4.12 of the Guarantee provides that additional Subsidiaries shall become Guarantors under the Guarantee by execution and delivery of an instrument in the form of this Supplement. The undersigned Subsidiary (the
New Subsidiary) is executing this Supplement in accordance with the requirements of the Credit Agreement and the Guarantee to become a Guarantor under the Guarantee in order to induce the Lenders to make additional Loans
and as consideration for Loans previously made.  Accordingly, the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and the New Subsidiary agree

securities and are issued to such Grantor or its nominee directly by the issuer thereof, such Grantor shall promptly notify the Collateral Agent thereof, and at the Collateral Agents reasonable request, pursuant to an agreement or
acknowledgement of such issuer in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent, either, at such Grantors option, (i) cause the issuer to agree to comply with instructions from the Collateral Agent as to such Pledged
Equity Interests, without further consent of any Grantor or such nominee, or (ii) arrange for the Collateral Agent to become the registered owner of such Pledged Equity Interests; and

including, without limitation, causing the issuer to register the pledge on its books and records or making such filings or recordings, in each case as may be necessary or advisable, under the laws of such issuers jurisdiction to ensure the
validity, perfection and priority of the security interest of the Collateral Agent therein.

Commercial Code of any applicable jurisdiction and (ii) shall at all times hereafter be represented by a certificate that is delivered to the Collateral Agent pursuant to the terms hereof. 
(b)    Each Grantor further acknowledges and agrees that (i) each interest in any United States limited liability
company or limited partnership which is a Subsidiary and pledged hereunder and not represented by a certificate shall not be a security within the meaning of Article 8 of the New York UCC and shall not be governed by Article 8 of the
Uniform Commercial Code of any applicable jurisdiction, and (ii) such Grantor shall at no time elect to treat any such interest as a security within the meaning of Article 8 of the New York UCC or issue any certificate representing
such interest, unless such Grantor delivers any such certificate to the Collateral Agent pursuant to the terms hereof. 
SECTION 3.05    Registration in Nominee Name; Denominations. The Collateral Agent, on behalf of the
Secured Parties, shall hold the Pledged Securities in the name of the applicable Grantor, endorsed or assigned in blank or in favor of the Collateral Agent, but following the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, shall have
the right (in its sole and absolute discretion), to hold the Pledged Securities in its own name as pledgee, or in the name of its nominee (as pledgee or as sub-agent).    Following the
occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, (i) each Grantor will promptly give to the Collateral Agent copies of any material written notices or other material written communications received by it with respect to Pledged
Securities in its capacity as the registered owner thereof and (ii) the Collateral Agent shall, upon a reasonable request, have the right to exchange the certificates representing Pledged Securities for certificates of smaller or larger
denominations for any purpose consistent with this Agreement.  SECTION 3.06    Voting Rights; Dividends and

(i)    each Grantor shall be entitled to exercise any and all voting and/or other consensual rights and
powers inuring to an owner of Pledged Collateral or any part thereof for any purpose consistent with the terms of this Agreement, the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents; provided that, except as permitted under the Credit Agreement, such
rights and powers shall not be exercised in any manner that could materially and adversely affect the rights inuring to a holder of any Pledged Securities, the rights and remedies of the Collateral Agent under this Agreement, the Credit Agreement or
any other Loan Documents. 
  -7- 


(ii)    the Collateral Agent shall execute and deliver to
each Grantor, or cause to be reasonably promptly executed and delivered to each Grantor, all such proxies, powers of attorney and other instruments as such Grantor may reasonably request for the purpose of enabling such Grantor to exercise the
voting and/or consensual rights and powers it is entitled to exercise pursuant to paragraph (i) above. 
(iii)    each Grantor shall be entitled to receive and retain any and all dividends, interest, principal
and other distributions paid on or distributed in respect of the Pledged Collateral to the extent and only to the extent that such dividends, interest, principal and other distributions are permitted by, and otherwise paid or distributed in
accordance with, the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement, the other Loan Documents and applicable laws; provided, however, that any non-cash dividends, interest, principal or other
distributions that would constitute Pledged Collateral, whether resulting from a subdivision, combination or reclassification of the outstanding Equity Interests of the issuer of any Pledged Collateral or received in exchange for Pledged Collateral
or any part thereof, or in redemption thereof, or as a result of any merger, consolidation, acquisition or other exchange of assets to which such issuer may be a party or otherwise, shall be and become part of the Pledged Collateral, and, if
received by any Grantor, shall not be commingled by such Grantor with any of its other funds or property but shall be held separate and apart therefrom, shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Secured
Parties, and, shall be forthwith delivered to the Collateral Agent in the same form as so received (with any necessary endorsement or instrument of assignment in accordance with Section 3.02(a); it being understood that no Grantor shall be
required to deliver possession of any uncertificated Pledged Equity Interests to the Collateral Agent).  (b)    Upon
the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, all rights of any Grantor to dividends, interest, principal or other distributions that such Grantor is authorized to receive pursuant to paragraph (a)(iii) of this
Section 3.06 shall cease, and all such rights shall thereupon become vested in the Collateral Agent, which shall have the sole and exclusive right and authority to receive and retain such dividends, interest, principal or
other distributions. All dividends, interest, principal or other distributions received by any Grantor contrary to the provisions of this Section 3.06 shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Collateral Agent, shall be
segregated from other property or funds of such Grantor and shall be promptly delivered to the Collateral Agent upon demand in the same form as so received (with any necessary endorsement or instrument of assignment). Any and all money and other
property paid over to or received by the Collateral Agent pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph (b) shall be retained by the Collateral Agent in an account to be established by the Collateral Agent upon receipt of such money or other
property and shall be applied in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.02. After all Events of Default have been cured or waived and the Borrowers have delivered to the Administrative Agent a certificate to that
effect, the Collateral Agent shall, promptly after all such Events of Default have been cured or waived, repay to each applicable Grantor (without interest) all dividends, interest, principal or other distributions that such Grantor would otherwise
be permitted to retain pursuant to the terms of paragraph (a)(iii) of this Section 3.06 and that remain in such account. 
(c)    Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, (i) all rights of any Grantor to
exercise the voting and consensual rights and powers it is entitled to exercise pursuant to paragraph (a)(i) of this Section 3.06, and the obligations of the Collateral Agent under paragraph (a)(ii) of this
Section 3.06, shall cease, and all such rights shall thereupon become vested in the Collateral Agent, which shall have the sole and exclusive right and authority to exercise such voting and consensual rights and powers;
provided that, unless otherwise directed by the Required Lenders, the Collateral Agent shall have the right from time to time following and during the continuance of an Event of Default to permit the Grantors to exercise such rights and
(ii) each Grantor agrees to, upon the request of the Collateral Agent, grant the Collateral Agent a proxy, and such other documents as may be necessary to allow the Collateral Agent to exercise such voting and consensual rights and powers.

collateral security and guarantees given by any Person with respect to any of the foregoing.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, in no event shall the Collateral (whether the Personal Property Collateral or the Pledged Collateral) include, and no Grantor shall be deemed to 
  -9- 



have assigned, pledged or granted a Security Interest in, any of such Grantors right, title or interest in any Excluded Collateral; provided that Excluded Collateral shall not
include any Proceeds, substitutions or replacements of any Excluded Collateral unless such Proceeds, substitutions or replacements would constitute Excluded Collateral. 
(b)    Each Grantor hereby irrevocably authorizes the Collateral Agent at any time and from time to time to file in any
relevant jurisdiction any initial financing statements (it being understood and agreed that with respect to fixtures, the Collateral Agent shall be authorized to file or record financing statements only in the jurisdiction of organization of a
Grantor, except in connection with a Mortgage) with respect to the Personal Property Collateral or any part thereof and amendments thereto that (i) indicate the Personal Property Collateral as all assets of such Grantor, whether now
owned or hereafter acquired, or words of similar effect, and (ii) contain the information required by Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code, or its equivalent, if applicable, in each applicable jurisdiction, for the filing of any financing
statement or amendment, including (A) whether such Grantor is an organization, the type of organization and any, if required in such jurisdiction, organizational identification number issued to such Grantor and (B) in the case of a
financing statement filed as a fixture filing, a sufficient description of the real property to which such Personal Property Collateral relates. Each Grantor agrees to provide such information to the Collateral Agent promptly upon reasonable
request.  The Collateral Agent is further authorized to file with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, the United States
Copyright Office, the Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market (European Community Trademarks), the World Intellectual Property Organization (Madrid Protocol Trademarks) or the Swiss Federal Institute of Intellectual Property (or, in each
case, any successor office) such documents as may be necessary or advisable for the purpose of perfecting, confirming, continuing, enforcing or protecting the Security Interest granted by each Grantor in any Registered Intellectual Property included
in the Personal Property Collateral and naming such Grantor or the Grantors as debtors and the Collateral Agent as secured party. 
(c)    The Security Interest is granted as security only and shall not subject the Collateral Agent or any other Secured
Party to, or in any way alter or modify, any obligation or liability of any Grantor with respect to or arising out of the Personal Property Collateral. 
(d)    Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) each Grantor shall remain liable for all obligations
under the Collateral and nothing contained herein is intended or shall be a delegation of duties to the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party, (ii) each Grantor shall remain liable under each of the agreements included in the Collateral,
including, without limitation, any agreements relating to Pledged Equity Interests constituting partnership interests or limited liability company interests, to perform all of the obligations undertaken by it thereunder all in accordance with and
pursuant to the terms and provisions thereof and neither the Collateral Agent nor any Secured Party shall have any obligation or liability under any of such agreements by reason of or arising out of this Agreement or any other document related
thereto nor shall the Collateral Agent nor any Secured Party have any obligation to make any inquiry as to the nature or sufficiency of any payment received by it or have any obligation to take any action to collect or enforce any rights under any
agreement included in the Collateral, including, without limitation, any agreements relating to Pledged Equity Interests constituting partnership interests or limited liability company interests, and (iii) the exercise by the Collateral Agent
of any of its rights hereunder shall not release any Grantor from any of its duties or obligations under the contracts and agreements included in the Collateral. 
  -10- 


SECTION 4.02    Representations and Warranties. The
Grantors jointly and severally represent and warrant to the Collateral Agent and the Secured Parties that: 
(a)    Each Grantor has good and valid rights in the Personal Property Collateral that is material to the
conduct of its business with respect to which it has purported to grant a Security Interest hereunder and has full power and authority to grant to the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, the Security Interest in such Personal
Property Collateral pursuant hereto and to execute, deliver and perform its obligations in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, without the consent or approval of any other person other than any consent or approval that has been obtained.
 (b)    Schedule V correctly sets forth the exact legal name of each Grantor and its
jurisdiction of organization as of the Closing Date.  (c)    The Security Interest constitutes a legal,
valid and enforceable security interest in favor of the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties in all Personal Property Collateral (with respect to Personal Property Collateral consisting of Equity Interests of Non-U.S. Subsidiaries, to the extent a security interest therein can be created under the New York UCC) securing the payment and performance of the Obligations, subject to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency or
similar laws affecting creditors rights generally and general equitable principles. The Security Interest will constitute a valid and perfected security interest in all Personal Property Collateral (to the extent perfection may be obtained by
the filings and other actions described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) below) in favor of the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties, upon (i) with respect to Collateral in which a security interest may be perfected by
filing a financing statement in the United States or any jurisdiction thereof pursuant to the Uniform Commercial Code in the relevant jurisdiction, the filing in the applicable filing offices of financing statements naming the applicable Grantor as
debtor and the Collateral Agent as secured party and describing the Collateral, (ii) with respect to Instruments, Chattel Paper, Pledged Securities and negotiable Documents in which a security interest may be perfected
by possession by the Collateral Agent, delivery to the Collateral Agent of all such Instruments, Chattel Paper, Pledged Securities and negotiable Documents in each case, accompanied by a stock power, note power or otherwise properly endorsed for
transfer in blank and (iii) with respect to Registered Intellectual Property, the recording of a fully executed short-form agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit B, C or D, as applicable, with the United States
Patent and Trademark Office, the Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market (European Community Trademarks), the World Intellectual Property Organization (Madrid Protocol Trademarks) or the Swiss Federal Institute of Intellectual Property (or,
in each case, any successor office), as applicable, within 90 days from the execution date of such short-form agreement or in the United States Copyright Office, with respect to U.S. registered Copyrights, within 30 days from the execution date of
such short-form agreement, as applicable. The Security Interest is and shall be prior to any other Lien on any of the Personal Property Collateral, other than Permitted Liens. 
(d)    The Personal Property Collateral is owned by the Grantors free and clear of any Lien, except for
Permitted Liens. As of the date hereof, no Grantor has filed or consented to the filing of any financing statement (or analogous document under any other applicable laws covering any Collateral) or security agreement naming a Grantor as debtor and
describing all or any portion of the Collateral that has not lapsed or been terminated except for financing statements or security agreements naming the Collateral Agent, on behalf of the Secured Parties, as the secured party, or otherwise permitted
by the Credit Agreement. 
  -11- 


SECTION 4.03    Covenants. Each Grantor hereby covenants
and agrees with the Collateral Agent that, from and after the date of this Agreement until the Maturity Date: 
(a)    Maintenance of Perfected Security Interest; Further Documentation. 
(i)    Such Grantor shall maintain the Security Interest created by this Agreement as a perfected Security Interest having
at least the priority required by the Credit Agreement and shall defend such Security Interest against the claims and demands of all Persons whomsoever, in each case subject to Permitted Liens. 
(ii)    Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, such Grantor will furnish to the Collateral Agent and the Lenders from
time to time statements and schedules further identifying and describing the assets and property of such Grantor and such other reports in connection therewith as the Collateral Agent may reasonably request. 
(iii)    Each Grantor agrees that at any time and from time to time, at the expense of such Grantor, it will execute any
and all further documents, financing statements, agreements and instruments, and take all such further actions (including the filing and recording of financing statements and other documents), which may be required under any applicable law, or
which, the Collateral Agent may reasonably request, in order (i) to grant, preserve, protect and perfect the validity and priority of the Security Interests created or intended to be created hereby or (ii) to enable the Collateral Agent to
exercise and enforce its rights and remedies hereunder with respect to any Collateral, including the filing of any financing or continuation statements under the Uniform Commercial Code in effect in any jurisdiction with respect to the Security
Interests created hereby and all applicable documents required under this Section 4.03(a)(iii), all at the expense of such Grantor. 
(iv)    Notwithstanding anything in this Section 4.03 to the contrary, (i) with respect to any assets acquired
by such Grantor after the date hereof that are required by the Credit Agreement to be subject to the Lien created hereby or (ii) with respect to any Person that, subsequent to the date hereof, becomes a Subsidiary that is required by the Credit
Agreement to become a party hereto, the relevant Grantor after the acquisition or creation thereof shall promptly take all actions required by the Credit Agreement and this Section 4.03. 
(b)    Damage or Destruction of Collateral. The Grantors agree promptly to notify the Collateral Agent if any
portion of the Collateral is damaged or destroyed in any manner which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. 
(c)    Notices. Each Grantor will advise the Collateral Agent promptly, in reasonable detail, of any Lien of which
it has knowledge (other than the Security Interests created hereby or Liens permitted under the Credit Agreement) on any of the Collateral which would reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. 
(d)    Changes in Locations, Name, Perfection Certificate updates etc. Each Grantor agrees to furnish to the
Collateral Agent the information set forth in Section 5.10 of the Credit Agreement in accordance therewith. 
(e)    Commercial Tort Claims. Each Grantor shall promptly notify the Collateral Agent of any Commercial Tort
Claims at any time held or acquired by such Grantor and such Grantor shall promptly update Schedule IV attached hereto, thereby granting to the Collateral Agent a security interest in such Commercial Tort Claim(s). The requirement in the
preceding sentence shall not apply to the extent that the amount of such Commercial Tort Claim is not reasonably estimated to exceed 5,000,000 held by each Grantor or to the extent such Grantor shall have previously notified the Agent with
respect to such Commercial Tort Claim. 
  -12- 


ARTICLE V 
REMEDIES 
SECTION 5.01    Remedies upon Default. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Enforcement
Event, each Grantor agrees to deliver each item of Collateral to the Collateral Agent on demand, and it is agreed that the Collateral Agent shall have the right to take any of or all the following actions at the same or different times:
(a) with respect to any Personal Property Collateral consisting of Intellectual Property, on demand, to cause the Security Interest to become an assignment, transfer and conveyance of any of or all such Personal Property Collateral by the
applicable Grantor to the Collateral Agent, or to license or sublicense, whether general, special or otherwise, and whether on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis, any such Personal Property Collateral throughout the world on such terms and
conditions and in such manner as the Collateral Agent shall determine, and (b) with or without legal process but with prior notice or demand for performance to the extent required by applicable law, to take possession of the Personal Property
Collateral and to enter any premises where the Personal Property Collateral may be located for the purpose of taking possession of or removing the Personal Property Collateral and, generally, to exercise any and all rights afforded to a secured
party under the Uniform Commercial Code of each applicable jurisdiction (including the New York UCC) or other applicable law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Grantor agrees that the Collateral Agent shall have the right,
subject to the mandatory requirements of applicable law, to sell or otherwise dispose of all or any part of the Collateral at a public or private sale or at any brokers board or on any securities exchange, for cash, upon credit or for future
delivery as the Collateral Agent shall deem appropriate. The Collateral Agent shall be authorized at any such sale of securities (if it deems it advisable to do so) to restrict the prospective bidders or purchasers to persons who will represent and
agree that they are purchasing the Collateral for their own account for investment and not with a view to the distribution or sale thereof, and upon consummation of any such sale the Collateral Agent shall have the right to assign, transfer and
deliver to the purchaser or purchasers thereof the Collateral so sold. Each such purchaser at any sale of Collateral shall hold the property sold absolutely free from any claim or right on the part of any Grantor, and each Grantor hereby waives (to
the extent permitted by law) all rights of redemption, stay and appraisal which such Grantor now has or may at any time in the future have under any rule of law or statute now existing or hereafter enacted. 
The Collateral Agent shall give each applicable Grantor at least 10 days prior written notice (which each Grantor agrees is reasonable
notice within the meaning of Section 9-611 of the New York UCC or its equivalent in other jurisdictions) of the Collateral Agents intention to make any sale of Collateral in the United States. Such
notice, in the case of a public sale, shall state the time and place for such sale and, in the case of a sale at a brokers board or on a securities exchange, shall state the board or exchange at which such sale is to be made and the day on
which the Collateral, or portion thereof, will first be offered for sale at such board or exchange. Any such public sale shall be held at such time or times within ordinary business hours and at such place or places as the Collateral Agent may fix
and state in the notice (if any) of such sale. At any such sale, the Collateral, or portion thereof, to be sold may be sold in one lot as an entirety or in separate parcels, as the Collateral Agent may (in its sole and absolute discretion)
determine. The Collateral Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale of any Collateral if it shall determine not to do so, regardless of the fact that notice of sale of such Collateral shall have been given. The Collateral Agent may, without
notice or publication, adjourn any public or private sale or cause the same to be adjourned from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed for sale, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which the
same was so adjourned. In case any sale of all or any part of the Collateral is made on credit or for future delivery, the Collateral so sold may be retained by the Collateral Agent until the sale price is paid by the purchaser or purchasers
thereof, but the Collateral Agent shall not incur any liability in case any such purchaser or purchasers shall fail to take up and pay for the Collateral so sold and, in case of any such failure, such

  -13- 



Collateral may be sold again upon like notice. At any public (or, to the extent permitted by law, private) sale made pursuant to this Agreement, any Secured Party may bid for or purchase, free
(to the extent permitted by applicable law) from any right of redemption, stay, valuation or appraisal on the part of any Grantor (all said rights being also hereby waived and released to the extent permitted by applicable law), the Collateral or
any part thereof offered for sale and may make payment on account thereof by using any claim then due and payable to such Secured Party from any Grantor as a credit against the purchase price, and such Secured Party may, upon compliance with the
terms of sale, hold, retain and dispose of such property without further accountability to any Grantor therefor. For purposes hereof, a written agreement to purchase the Collateral or any portion thereof shall be treated as a sale thereof; the
Collateral Agent shall be free to carry out such sale pursuant to such agreement and no Grantor shall be entitled to the return of the Collateral or any portion thereof subject thereto, notwithstanding the fact that after the Collateral Agent shall
have entered into such an agreement all Events of Default shall have been remedied and the Obligations paid in full. As an alternative to exercising the power of sale herein conferred upon it, the Collateral Agent may proceed by a suit or suits at
law or in equity to foreclose this Agreement and to sell the Collateral or any portion thereof pursuant to a judgment or decree of a court or courts having competent jurisdiction or pursuant to a proceeding by a court-appointed receiver. Any sale
pursuant to the provisions of this Section 5.01 shall be deemed to conform to the commercially reasonable standards as provided in Section 9-610(b) of the New York UCC or its
equivalent in other jurisdictions.  The Collateral Agent hereby authorizes each Grantor to collect such Grantors accounts and the
Collateral Agent may curtail or terminate said authority at any time after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default upon prior written notice to such Grantor. If required in writing by the Collateral Agent at any time after
the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, any payments of accounts, when collected by any Grantor, shall be held by such Grantor in trust for the Collateral Agent and the Secured Parties, segregated from other funds of such
Grantor until said authority is curtailed or terminated by the Collateral Agent and such payments are turned over to the Collateral Agent. 
At any time after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Collateral Agent shall notify obligors on the accounts
that the accounts have been assigned to the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties and that payments in respect thereof shall be made directly to the Collateral Agent. 
Neither the Collateral Agent nor any Secured Party shall have any obligation or liability under any Account (or any agreement giving rise
thereto) by reason of or arising out of this Agreement or the receipt by the Collateral Agent or any Secured Party of any payment relating thereto, nor shall the Collateral Agent or any Secured Party be obligated in any manner to perform any of the
obligations of any Grantor under or pursuant to any account (or any agreement giving rise thereto), to make any payment, to make any inquiry as to the nature or the sufficiency of any payment received by it or as to the sufficiency of any
performance by any party thereunder, to present or file any claim, to take any action to enforce any performance or to collect the payment of any amounts which may have been assigned to it or to which it may be entitled at any time or times. 
As among each Grantor, the Collateral Agent and the Secured Parties, each Grantor shall remain liable to observe and perform all the
conditions and obligations to be observed and performed by it under each contract, agreement or instrument relating to the Collateral, all in accordance with the terms and conditions thereof. 
SECTION 5.02    Application of Proceeds. The proceeds of any collection, sale, foreclosure or other
realization upon any Collateral, including any Collateral consisting of cash, shall be applied by the Collateral Agent in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement. 
  -14- 


SECTION 5.03    Grant of License to Use Intellectual Property;
Assignment of Licensed Intellectual Property to Collateral Agent.  (a)    For the purpose of enabling the
Collateral Agent to exercise rights and remedies under this Agreement, each Grantor hereby grants (but subject always to the then existing license agreements or other rights of third parties, to the extent such license agreements and other rights
are Permitted Liens) to the Collateral Agent an irrevocable (until this Agreement is terminated), nonexclusive license (exercisable without payment of royalty or other compensation to the Grantors), to use, license or sublicense any of the Personal
Property Collateral consisting of Patents, Trademarks and Copyrights and any other Intellectual Property, in each case, now owned or hereafter acquired by such Grantor, and wherever the same may be located, and including in such license (but subject
always to the then existing license agreements or other rights of third parties, to the extent such license agreements and other rights are Permitted Liens) access to all media in which any of the licensed items may be recorded or stored and to all
computer software and programs used for the compilation or printout thereof. The Collateral Agent undertakes that the use of such license by the Collateral Agent may be exercised, at the option of the Collateral Agent, only upon the occurrence and
during the continuation of an Enforcement Event.  (b)    Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
Default, each Grantor shall, at the request of the Collateral Agent, use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all requisite consents or approvals of each licensor to Grantor under each Copyright License, Patent License or Trademark License that
shall require such consent to effect the assignment of all such Grantors right, title and interest thereunder to the Collateral Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Secured Parties, or its designee. 
(c)    If (i) an Event of Default shall have occurred and, by reason of cure, waiver, modification, amendment or
otherwise, is no longer continuing, (ii) no other Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, (iii) an assignment to the Collateral Agent of any rights, title and interest in and to the Intellectual Property shall have been
previously made, and (iv) the Obligations shall not have become immediately due and payable, then, upon the written request of any Grantor, the Collateral Agent shall promptly execute and deliver to such Grantor such assignments as may be
necessary to reassign to such Grantor any such rights, title and interests as may have been made by the Collateral Agent as aforesaid, subject to any disposition thereof that may have been made by the Collateral Agent in accordance with this Article
V; provided, after giving effect to such reassignment, the Collateral Agents security interest granted pursuant hereto, as well as all other rights and remedies of the Collateral Agent granted hereunder, shall continue to be in full
force and effect. The rights, title and interests so reassigned shall be free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens (if any). 
ARTICLE VI 
MISCELLANEOUS 
SECTION 6.01    Notices. All communications and notices hereunder shall (except as otherwise expressly
permitted herein) be in writing and given as provided in Section 9.01 of the Credit Agreement. 
SECTION 6.02    Security Interest Absolute. All rights of the Collateral Agent hereunder, the Security
Interest, the grant of a security interest in the Pledged Collateral and all obligations of each Grantor hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional irrespective of (a) any lack of validity or enforceability relating to or against any Grantor
of the Credit Agreement, any other Loan Document, any agreement with respect to any of the Obligations or any other agreement or instrument relating to any of the foregoing, (b) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any

  -15- 



other term of, all or any of the Obligations, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to any departure from the Credit Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement or
instrument relating to the foregoing, (c) any exchange, release or non-perfection of any Lien on other collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent under or departure from any
guarantee, securing or guaranteeing all or any of the Obligations, or (d) any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, any Grantor in respect of the Obligations or this Agreement, except that
a Grantor may assert the defense of payment in full of the Obligations (other than those expressly stated to survive the Maturity Date). 
SECTION 6.03    Survival of Agreement. All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made
by the Loan Parties in the Loan Documents and in the certificates or other instruments prepared or delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be considered to have been relied upon by the Lenders and
shall survive the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents and the making of any Loans, regardless of any investigation made by any Lender or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Collateral Agent or any Lender may have had notice or
knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended under the Credit Agreement, and shall continue in full force and effect until the Maturity Date. 
SECTION 6.04    Binding Effect; Several Agreement. This Agreement shall become effective as to any Loan
Party when a counterpart hereof executed on behalf of such Loan Party shall have been delivered to the Collateral Agent and a counterpart hereof shall have been executed on behalf of the Collateral Agent, and thereafter shall be binding upon such
Loan Party and the Collateral Agent and their respective permitted successors, indorsees, transferees and assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of such Loan Party, the Collateral Agent and the other Secured Parties and their respective successors
and assigns, except that no Loan Party shall have the right to assign or transfer its rights or obligations hereunder or any interest herein or in the Collateral (and any such assignment or transfer shall be void) except as expressly contemplated or
permitted by this Agreement or the Credit Agreement. This Agreement shall be construed as a separate agreement with respect to each Loan Party and may be amended, modified, supplemented, waived or released with respect to any Loan Party without the
approval of any other Loan Party and without affecting the obligations of any other Loan Party hereunder. 
SECTION 6.05    Successors and Assigns. Whenever in this Agreement any of the parties hereto is
referred to, such reference shall be deemed to include the permitted successors and assigns of such party; and all covenants, promises and agreements by or on behalf of any Grantor or the Collateral Agent that are contained in this Agreement shall
bind and inure to the benefit of their respective successors and assigns.  SECTION 6.06    Collateral
Agents Fees and Expenses; Indemnification.  (a)    The parties hereto agree that the Collateral Agent
shall be entitled to reimbursement of its reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred hereunder to the extent provided in Section 9.05 of the Credit

Grantors shall jointly and severally have the indemnification obligations to the same extent as the Borrowers as described in Section 9.05 of the Credit Agreement. 
SECTION 6.07    Collateral Agent Appointed
Attorney-in-Fact. Each Grantor hereby appoints the Collateral Agent as the
attorney-in-fact of such Grantor for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this Agreement and taking any action and executing any instrument that the Collateral
Agent may deem necessary or advisable to accomplish the purposes hereof, which appointment is 
  -16- 



irrevocable and coupled with an interest; provided that the Collateral Agent may only take actions as
attorney-in-fact after the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Collateral Agent shall
have the right upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, with full power of substitution either in the Collateral Agents name or in the name of such Grantor (a) to receive, endorse, assign and/or deliver any
and all notes, acceptances, checks, drafts, money orders or other evidences of payment relating to the Collateral or any part thereof, (b) to demand, collect, receive payment of, give receipt for and give discharges and releases of all or any
of the Collateral, (c) to sign the name of any Grantor on any invoice or bill of lading relating to any of the Collateral, (d) to send verifications of Accounts Receivable to any Account Debtor, (e) to commence and prosecute any and
all suits, actions or proceedings at law or in equity in any court of competent jurisdiction to collect or otherwise realize on all or any of the Collateral or to enforce any rights in respect of any Collateral, (f) to settle, compromise,
compound, adjust or defend any actions, suits or proceedings relating to all or any of the Collateral, (g) to notify, or to require any Grantor to notify, Account Debtors to make payment directly to the Collateral Agent, and (h) to use,
sell, assign, transfer, pledge, make any agreement with respect to or otherwise deal with all or any of the Collateral, and to do all other acts and things necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, as fully
and completely as though the Collateral Agent were the absolute owner of the Collateral for all purposes; provided, however, that nothing herein contained shall be construed as requiring or obligating the Collateral Agent to make any
commitment or to make any inquiry as to the nature or sufficiency of any payment received by the Collateral Agent, or to present or file any claim or notice, or to take any action with respect to the Collateral or any part thereof or the moneys due
or to become due in respect thereof or any property covered thereby. The Collateral Agent and the other Secured Parties shall be accountable only for amounts actually received as a result of the exercise of the powers granted to them herein, and
neither they nor their officers, directors, employees or agents shall be responsible to any Grantor for any act or failure to act hereunder, except for their own gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith. 
At its option, during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Collateral Agent may discharge past due Taxes, assessments, charges, fees,
Liens, security interests or other encumbrances at any time levied or placed on the Collateral and not expressly permitted pursuant to the Loan Documents, and may pay for the maintenance and preservation of the Collateral to the extent any Grantor
fails to do so as required by the Credit Agreement or this Agreement, and each Grantor jointly and severally agrees to reimburse the Collateral Agent on demand for any reasonable payment made or any reasonable expense incurred by the Collateral
Agent pursuant to the foregoing authorization; provided, however, that nothing in this paragraph shall be interpreted as excusing any Grantor from the performance of, or imposing any obligation on the Collateral Agent or any Secured
Party to cure or perform, any covenants or other promises of any Grantor with respect to Taxes, assessments, charges, fees, Liens, security interests or other encumbrances and maintenance as set forth herein or in the other Loan Documents. 
SECTION 6.08    Applicable Law. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER
SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. 
SECTION 6.09    Waivers; Amendment. 
(a)    No failure or delay by the Collateral Agent, the Administrative Agent or any Lender in exercising any right or power
hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver hereof or thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Collateral Agent, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are

  -17- 



cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of any Loan Document or consent to any departure by any Loan Party therefrom
shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section 6.09, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which
given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender may
have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time. No notice or demand on any Loan Party in any case shall entitle any Loan Party to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.

(b)    Each Grantor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do

Exhibit A 
to the U.S. Collateral Agreement 
SUPPLEMENT NO.     , dated as of, 20[    ], to the U.S. Collateral Agreement, dated as of
January 5, 2017 (the Collateral Agreement), among CLAIRES (GIBRALTAR) INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS LIMITED (Holdings) and CLAIRES GERMANY GMBH (together with Holdings, each, a
Borrower and collectively, the Borrowers), each of the Subsidiaries listed on the signature pages thereto or that becomes a party thereto pursuant to Section 6.16 thereof (together with the
Borrowers (each in its capacity thereunder), each a Grantor and, collectively, the Grantors) and CORLAND CAPITAL MARKET SERVICES LLC, as collateral agent (in such capacity, including any successor
thereto, the Collateral Agent) for the Secured Parties.  A. Reference is made to the Credit Agreement, dated as
of the date hereof (as amended, restated, amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the Credit Agreement), among the Borrowers, the lenders from time to time party thereto (the
Lenders), Boticelli, L.L.C., as administrative agent (the Administrative Agent) and Lender, and the Collateral Agent. 
B. Capitalized terms used herein (including in this preamble) and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to such terms
in the Credit Agreement or the Collateral Agreement referred to therein, as applicable.  C. The Grantors have entered into the Collateral
Agreement in order to induce the Lenders to make the Loans. Section 6.16 of the Collateral Agreement provides that additional Subsidiaries shall become Grantors under the Collateral Agreement by execution and delivery of an instrument in the
form of this Supplement. The undersigned Subsidiary (the New Subsidiary) is executing this Supplement in accordance with the requirements of the Credit Agreement and the Collateral Agreement to become a Grantor under the
Collateral Agreement in order to induce the Lenders to make additional Loans and as consideration for Loans previously made.  Accordingly,
the Collateral Agent and the New Subsidiary agree as follows:  SECTION 1. In accordance with Section 6.16 of the Collateral
Agreement, the New Subsidiary by its signature below becomes a Grantor under the Collateral Agreement with the same force and effect as if originally named therein as a Grantor and the New Subsidiary hereby (a) agrees to all the terms and
provisions of the Collateral Agreement applicable to it as a Grantor and (b) represents and warrants that the representations and warranties made by it as a Grantor thereunder (giving effect to any supplements to schedules thereto delivered in
connection herewith) are true and correct on and as of the date hereof. In furtherance of the foregoing, the New Subsidiary, as security for the payment and performance in full of the Obligations (as defined in the Collateral Agreement), does hereby
create and grant to the Collateral Agent, its successors and assigns, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, a security interest in and lien on all of the New Subsidiarys right, title and interest in and to the Collateral (as defined in the
Collateral Agreement) of the New Subsidiary. Each reference to a Grantor in the Collateral Agreement shall be deemed to include the New Subsidiary. The Collateral Agreement is hereby incorporated herein by reference. 
SECTION 2. The New Subsidiary represents and warrants to the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties that this Supplement has
been duly authorized, executed and delivered by it 
  A-1 



and constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that enforcement thereof may be limited by any applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws now or hereafter in effect affecting creditors rights generally and by general principles of equity. 
SECTION 3. This Supplement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall
constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Supplement shall become effective when the Collateral Agent shall have received counterparts of this Supplement, which when taken together, bears
the signatures of the New Subsidiary and the Collateral Agent. Delivery of an executed signature page to this Supplement by facsimile or other electronic transmission (including by .pdf, .tif or similar format) shall be as effective as delivery of a
manually signed counterpart of this Supplement.  SECTION 4. The New Subsidiary hereby represents and warrants that attached to this
Agreement are duly completed schedules and, if applicable, short-form agreements substantially in the form of Exhibits C, D or E to the Collateral Agreement, as applicable, in each case, with respect to the New Subsidiary (the
Supplemental Schedules). The New Subsidiary represents and warrants that the information contained on each of the Supplemental Schedules with respect to such New Subsidiary and its properties and affairs is true and correct
in all material respects (except that any representation or warranty that is qualified as to materiality or Material Adverse Effect shall be true in all respects) as of the date hereof. 
SECTION 5. Except as expressly supplemented hereby, the Collateral Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. 
SECTION 6. THIS SUPPLEMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, AND GOVERNED BY,
THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.  SECTION 7. In case any one or more of the provisions contained in this Supplement should be held
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein and in the Collateral Agreement shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby (it being understood that
the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not in and of itself affect the validity of such provision in any other jurisdiction). The parties hereto shall endeavor in good-faith negotiations to replace the invalid,
illegal or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions. 
SECTION 8. All communications and notices hereunder shall be in writing and given as provided in Section 6.01 of the Collateral
Agreement.  SECTION 9. The New Subsidiary agrees to reimburse the Collateral Agent in accordance with Section 6.06(a) of the Collateral
Agreement. 
  A-2 


IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the New Subsidiary and the Collateral Agent have duly executed this
Supplement to the Collateral Agreement as of the day and year first above written.
