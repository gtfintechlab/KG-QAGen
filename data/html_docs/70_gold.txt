constituting a repayment or novation of such Committed Loans. The portion of the principal amount of the Converted Term Loan held
by each Lender outstanding on the Conversion Date shall equal the aggregate principal amount of the Committed Loans of such Lender
outstanding on the Conversion Date immediately prior to such conversion. No portion of the Converted Term Loan shall be made at
any time after the Conversion Date. To the extent repaid, the Converted Term Loan may not be reborrowed.
 
2.2          Types of Loans;
Borrowings.
 
(a)           The
Committed Loans and Converted Term Loan (each a “Class” of Loan) shall each be LIBOR Loans (except under the
circumstances described in Sections 2.14(e), 2.14(f) and 2.21).
 
(b)           In
order to make a Borrowing (other than Borrowings for the purpose of repaying Reimbursement Obligations, which shall be made pursuant
to Section 2.21), the Borrower will give the Administrative Agent written notice not later than 11:00 a.m., Charlotte,
North Caroline time, three Business Days prior to each Borrowing; provided, however, that requests for the Borrowing of
any Committed Loans to be made on the Closing Date may, at the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be given with less advance
notice than as specified hereinabove. Each such notice (each, a “Notice of Borrowing”) shall be irrevocable,
shall be given in the form of Exhibit B and shall specify (1) the aggregate principal amount of the Committed Loans to
be made pursuant to such Borrowing, and (2) the requested Borrowing Date, which shall be a Business Day. Upon its receipt of a
Notice of Borrowing, the Administrative Agent will promptly notify each applicable Lender of the proposed Borrowing. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, the aggregate principal amount of each Borrowing shall not be less than $5,000,000.
 


33
 

 
(c)           Not later than
1:00 p.m., Charlotte, North Carolina time, on the requested Borrowing Date, each applicable Lender will make available to the Administrative
Agent in accordance with the Payment Instructions an amount, in Dollars and in immediately available funds, equal to the amount
of the Loan or Loans to be made by such Lender. Upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in Section 3.2
(and, if such Borrowing is made on the Closing Date, Section 3.1) and to the extent such Lenders have made such amounts
available to the Administrative Agent as provided hereinabove, the Administrative Agent will make the aggregate of such amounts
available to the Borrower in accordance with Section 2.3(a) and in like funds as received by the Administrative Agent.
 
2.3          Disbursements;
Funding Reliance; Domicile of Loans.
 
(a)           The Borrower
hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to disburse the proceeds of each Borrowing in accordance with the terms of any written
instructions from any Authorized Officer of the Borrower; provided that the Administrative Agent shall not be obligated
under any circumstances to forward amounts to any account not listed in an Account Designation Letter. The Borrower may at any
time deliver to the Administrative Agent an Account Designation Letter listing any additional accounts or deleting any accounts
listed in a previous Account Designation Letter.
 
(b)           Unless
the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing, that such Lender
will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender’s share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may
assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with Section 2.2 and may, in reliance
upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its
share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally
agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from
and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative
Agent, at (i) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined
by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, and (ii) in the case of a payment
to be made by the Borrower, the Adjusted LIBOR Rate. If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative
Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such
interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the Administrative
Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender’s Loan included in such Borrowing. Any payment by the Borrower
shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to
the Administrative Agent.
 


34
 

 
(c)           The obligations
of the Lenders hereunder to make Loans, to fund participations in L/C Obligations and to make payments pursuant to Sections
2.15(e) and 10.1(c) are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan, to fund any such participation
or to make any such payment on any date shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation, if any, hereunder to
do so on such date, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan, purchase its participation
or to make any such payment required hereunder.
 
(d)           Each Lender may, at its option, make and maintain any Loan at, to or for the account of any of its Lending Offices; provided
that any exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay such Loan to or for the account of such
Lender in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
 
2.4           Evidence of
Debt; Notes.
 
(a)           Each Lender
shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to the
applicable Lending Office of such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lending Office of such Lender from time to time,
including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lending Office of such Lender from time to time under
this Agreement.
 
(b)           The Administrative Agent shall maintain the Register pursuant to Section 10.6(d), and a subaccount for each Lender, in which
Register and subaccounts (taken together) shall be recorded (i) the amount, Class and Type of each such Loan, (ii) the amount of
any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder in respect of
each such Loan and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder from the Borrower in respect of each
such Loan and each Lender’s share thereof.
 
(c)           The
entries made in the accounts, Register and subaccounts maintained pursuant to Section 2.4(b) (and, if consistent with the
entries of the Administrative Agent, Section 2.4(a)) shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be prima facie evidence
of the existence and amounts of the obligations of the Borrower therein recorded; provided, however, that the failure
of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such account, such Register or such subaccount, as applicable, or any error
therein, shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay (with applicable interest) the Loans made to the
Borrower by such Lender in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
 
(d)           The Loans of each Class made by each Lender shall, if requested by the applicable Lender (which request shall be made to the Administrative
Agent), be evidenced by a Note appropriately completed in substantially the form of Exhibit A, in each case executed by
the Borrower and payable to the order of such Lender. Each Note shall be entitled to all of the benefits of this Agreement and
the other Credit Documents and shall be subject to the provisions hereof and thereof.
 


35
 

 
2.5       Termination
and Reduction of Commitments.
 
(a)        The Commitments
shall be automatically and permanently terminated on the Termination Date, unless sooner terminated pursuant to any other provision
of this Section 2.5 or Section 8.2 (provided that the Converted Term Loan and any Letters of Credit outstanding
as of the Conversion Date (and, for the avoidance of doubt, the Lenders’ obligations to purchase and fund participations
in such Letters of Credit) may remain outstanding after the Conversion Date, subject to the other provisions hereof).
 
(b)      
At any time and from time to time after the date hereof, upon not less than five Business Days’ prior written notice to the
Administrative Agent, the Borrower may terminate in whole or reduce in part the aggregate Unutilized Commitments; provided
that any such partial reduction shall be in an aggregate amount of not less than $5,000,000 or, if greater, an integral multiple
of $1,000,000 in excess thereof. The amount of any termination or reduction made under this Section 2.5(b) may not thereafter
be reinstated.
 
(c)        Each reduction
of the Commitments pursuant to this Section shall be applied ratably among the Lenders according to their respective Commitments.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any reduction of the Commitments pursuant to this Section 2.5
that has the effect of reducing the aggregate Commitments to an amount less than the amount of the L/C Sublimit at such time
shall result in an automatic corresponding reduction of the L/C Sublimit to the amount of the aggregate Commitments (as so reduced),
without any further action on the part of the Borrower, the L/C Issuer or any other Lender.
 
2.6       Mandatory Payments
and Prepayments.
 
(a)        The Administrative
Agent shall calculate and deliver to the Borrower an amortization schedule for the Converted Term Loan providing for the monthly
payment of principal and interest based on (i) the outstanding principal balance of the Converted Term Loan on the Conversion Date,
and (ii) an amortization period equal to the weighted average of the Project Amortization Periods for each of the Borrowing Base
Projects (with each such Project Amortization Period being weighted based on the percentage of the Converted Term Loan represented
by the aggregate amount of Committed Loans advanced with respect to the Borrowing Base Project to which such Project Amortization
Period applies), and such amortization schedule as so determined by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest
error. Except to the extent due or paid sooner pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, the Borrower will repay the aggregate
outstanding principal of and interest on the Converted Term Loan in the amounts and on the dates set forth on such amortization
schedule prepared and delivered by the Administrative Agent.
 
(b)       
Except to the extent due or paid sooner pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, the aggregate outstanding principal of the
Converted Term Loan and all accrued and unpaid interest thereon shall be due and payable in full on the Maturity Date.
 
(c)         In the event that, at any time, the Aggregate Credit
Exposure shall exceed the Credit Limit at such time (after giving effect to any concurrent termination or reduction of the Commitments),
the Borrower will immediately prepay the outstanding principal amount of the Loans in the amount of such excess.
 


36 
 

 
(d)       
Promptly upon (and in any event not later than one Business Day after) receipt thereof by any Restricted Party, the Borrower will
prepay the outstanding principal amount of the Loans and repay and Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations in the manner set forth
below, in an amount equal to 100% of the Net Cash Proceeds from any Debt Issuance, and will deliver to the Administrative Agent,
concurrently with such prepayment, a certificate signed by a Financial Officer of the Borrower in form and substance satisfactory
to the Administrative Agent and setting forth the calculation of such Net Cash Proceeds.
 
(e)        Not later than
two Business Days after receipt by any Credit Party or other Restricted Party of any proceeds of insurance, condemnation award
or other compensation in respect of any Material Casualty Event, the Borrower will deliver to the Administrative Agent an amount
equal to 100% of the Net Cash Proceeds from such Material Casualty Event and a certificate signed by a Financial Officer of the
Borrower in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and setting forth the calculation of such Net Cash Proceeds
(such delivery date, for purposes of this Section 2.6(e), the “Proceeds Delivery Date”). If, on or after
any Proceeds Delivery Date and before the day that is 90 days thereafter, (x) the Required Lenders approve an Approval Request
that designates one or more Projects as Borrowing Base Projects or (y) the Borrower repairs or replaces (to the satisfaction of
the Administrative Agent) the property subject to such Material Casualty Event, then the Administrative Agent will distribute to
the Borrower an amount equal to, as applicable, the aggregate Project Values for such newly designated Borrowing Base Projects
or the cost of such repairs or replacement, in each case from the Net Cash Proceeds delivered on such Proceeds Delivery Date (but
not, in any event, any amount in excess of such Net Cash Proceeds). On the day that is 90 days after each Proceeds Delivery Date
(or, if earlier, upon the Borrower’s determination not to submit any Approval Requests with respect to any new Projects or
repair or replace the property subject to the applicable Material Casualty Event), such Net Cash Proceeds will be applied to prepay
the outstanding principal amount of the Loans and repay and Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations in the manner set forth below,
in an amount equal to 100% of the Net Cash Proceeds from such Material Casualty Event (less any amounts theretofore distributed
to the Borrower in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence); provided, however, that (x) any and all such proceeds
received or held by the Administrative Agent or any Credit Party or other Restricted Party during the continuance of an Event of
Default (regardless of any proposed or actual use thereof for repair, replacement or reinvestment) shall be applied to prepay the
outstanding principal amount of the Loans and repay and Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations in the manner set forth below and
(y) notwithstanding the foregoing in this clause (e) or clause (f) below, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing,
the aggregate Net Cash Proceeds payable under this clause (e) and clause (f) below from all Material Casualty Events and Asset
Dispositions with respect to any single Borrowing Base Project shall not exceed the Project Value assigned to such Borrowing Base
Project pursuant hereto.
 


37 
 

 
(f)
       Not later than two Business Days after receipt by any Credit Party or other
Restricted Party of any proceeds of any Asset Disposition of any Project owned by any Restricted Party, the Borrower will
deliver to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to 100% of the Net Cash Proceeds from such Asset Disposition and a
certificate signed by a Financial Officer of the Borrower in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and
setting forth the calculation of such Net Cash Proceeds (such delivery date, for purposes of this Section 2.6(f), the
“Proceeds Delivery Date”). If, on or after any Proceeds Delivery Date and before the day that is 90 days
thereafter, the Required Lenders approve an Approval Request that designates one or more Projects as Borrowing Base Projects,
then the Administrative Agent will distribute to the Borrower an amount equal to the aggregate Project Values for such newly
designated Borrowing Base Projects from the Net Cash Proceeds delivered on such Proceeds Delivery Date (but not any amount in
excess of such Net Cash Proceeds). On the day that is 90 days after each Proceeds Delivery Date (or, if earlier, upon the
Borrower’s determination not to submit any Approval Requests with respect to any new Projects), such Net Cash Proceeds
will be applied to prepay the outstanding principal amount of the Loans and repay and Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations
in the manner set forth below, in an amount equal to 100% of the Net Cash Proceeds from such Asset Disposition (less any
amounts theretofore distributed to the Borrower in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence); provided, however,
that (x) any and all such proceeds received or held by the Administrative Agent or any Credit Party or other Restricted
Party during the continuance of an Event of Default (regardless of any proposed or actual use thereof for repair, replacement
or reinvestment) shall be applied to prepay the outstanding principal amount of the Loans and repay and Cash Collateralize
the L/C Obligations in the manner set forth below and (y) notwithstanding the foregoing in this clause (f) or clause (e)
above, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the aggregate Net Cash Proceeds payable under this
clause (f) and clause (e) above from all Asset Dispositions and Material Casualty Events with respect to any single Borrowing
Base Project shall not exceed the Project Value assigned to such Borrowing Base Project pursuant hereto.
 
(g)       
Each prepayment made pursuant to Sections 2.6(d) through 2.6(f) shall be applied (i) first, (x) at any time
on or after the Conversion Date, to reduce the outstanding principal amount of the Converted Term Loan, with such re

vanced in respect of the Borrowing Base Project that
is subject to the applicable Material Casualty Event or Asset Disposition, and applied to each such corresponding portion of the
remaining scheduled principal payments in the inverse order of maturity), or (y) at any time prior to the Conversion Date, to reduce
the outstanding principal amount of the Committed Loans, and (ii) second, the extent of any excess remaining after application
as provided in clause (i) above, to repay and Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations. Within each Class of Loans, such prepayments
shall be applied first to prepay all Base Rate Loans, and then to prepay LIBOR Loans. Each payment or prepayment pursuant to the
provisions of this Section 2.6 shall be applied ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans being prepaid, in proportion
to the principal amount held by each; provided that if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender at the time of any such prepayment,
any mandatory prepayment of the Loans shall, if the Administrative Agent so directs at the time of making such mandatory prepayment,
be applied to the Loans of other Lenders as if such Defaulting Lender had no Loans outstanding and the outstanding Loans of such
Defaulting Lender were zero. Each payment or prepayment of a LIBOR Loan made pursuant to the provisions of this Section on a day
other than the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto shall be made together with all amounts required under Section
2.16 to be paid as a consequence thereof.
 


38 
 

 
(h)       
In the event the Administrative Agent receives a notice of prepayment with respect to Sections 2.6(d) through 2.6(f),
the Administrative Agent will give prompt notice thereof to the Lenders; provided that if such notice has also been furnished
to the Lenders, the Administrative Agent shall have no obligation to notify the Lenders with respect thereto.
 
2.7       Voluntary Prepayments.
 
(a)        At any
time and from time to time, the Borrower shall have the right to prepay the Loans, in whole or in part, without premium or
penalty (except as provided in clause (iii) below), upon written notice given to the Administrative Agent not later than
11:00 a.m., Charlotte, North Carolina time, three Business Days prior to each intended prepayment of LIBOR Loans and one
Business Day prior to each intended prepayment of Base Rate Loans; provided that (i) each partial prepayment of LIBOR
Loans shall be in an aggregate principal amount of not less than $5,000,000 or, if greater, an integral multiple of
$1,000,000 in excess thereof, and each partial prepayment of Base Rate Loans shall be in an aggregate principal amount of not
less than $3,000,000 or, if greater, an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, (ii) no partial prepayment of
LIBOR Loans made pursuant to any single Borrowing shall reduce the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the remaining
LIBOR Loans under such Borrowing to less than $5,000,000 or to any greater amount not an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in
excess thereof, and (iii) unless made together with all amounts required under Section 2.16 to be paid as a
consequence of such prepayment, a prepayment of a LIBOR Loan may be made only on the last day of the Interest Period
applicable thereto. Each such notice shall specify the proposed date of such prepayment and the aggregate principal amount,
Class and Type of the Loans to be prepaid, and shall be irrevocable and shall bind the Borrower to make such prepayment on
the terms specified therein. In the event the Administrative Agent receives a notice of prepayment under this Section
2.7(a), the Administrative Agent will give prompt notice thereof to the Lenders; provided that if such notice has
also been furnished to the Lenders, the Administrative Agent shall have no obligation to notify the Lenders with
respect thereto.
 
(b)       
Each prepayment of the Converted Term Loan made pursuant to Section 2.7(a) shall be applied to the remaining scheduled principal
payments in each instance on a pro rata basis. Each prepayment of the Loans made pursuant to Section 2.7(a) shall be applied
ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans being prepaid, in proportion to the principal amount held by each; provided
that if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender at the time of any such prepayment, any voluntary prepayment of the Loans shall, if the
Administrative Agent so directs at the time of making such voluntary prepayment, be applied to the Loans of other Lenders as if
such Defaulting Lender had no Loans outstanding and the outstanding Loans of such Defaulting Lender were zero.
 
2.8       Interest.
 
(a)        Except as otherwise
expressly provided herein, the Borrower will pay interest in respect of the unpaid principal amount of each Loan, from the date
of Borrowing thereof until such principal amount shall be paid in full, at the Adjusted LIBOR Rate, as in effect from time to time
during such periods.
 


39 
 

 
(b)       Upon the
occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default under Section 8.1(a), 8.1(f) or 8.1(g) and
(at the election of the Required Lenders) upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any other Event of Default, all
outstanding principal amounts of the Loans and, to the greatest extent permitted by law, all interest accrued on the Loans
and all other accrued and outstanding fees and other amounts hereunder or under any other Credit Document, shall bear
interest at a rate per annum equal to the interest rate applicable from time to time thereafter to such Loans plus
2.0% per annum (or, in the case of interest, fees and other amounts for which no rate is provided hereunder, at the Adjusted
Base Rate plus 2.

maximum amount permitted by applicable law to be charged by such Lender,
the amount of interest payable for its account on such interest payment date shall be automatically reduced to such maximum permissible
amount. In the event of any such reduction affecting any Lender, if from time to time thereafter the amount of interest payable
for the account of such Lender on any interest payment date would be less than the maximum amount permitted by applicable law to
be charged by such Lender, then the amount of interest payable for its account on such subsequent interest payment date shall be
automatically increased to such maximum permissible amount; provided that at no time shall the aggregate amount by which
interest paid for the account of any Lender has been increased pursuant to this sentence exceed the aggregate amount by which interest
paid for its account has theretofore been reduced pursuant to the previous sentence.
 
(e)        The Administrative
Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders upon determining the interest rate for each Borrowing of LIBOR Loans after
its receipt of the relevant Notice of Borrowing; provided, however, that the failure of the Administrative Agent to provide
the Borrower or the Lenders with any such notice shall neither affect any obligations of the Borrower or the Lenders hereunder
nor result in any liability on the part of the Administrative Agent to the Borrower or any Lender. Each such determination (including
each determination of the reserve requirement reflected in the LIBOR Rate) shall, absent manifest error, be conclusive and binding
on all parties hereto.
 
2.9       Fees. The
Borrower agrees to pay:
 
(a)
      To the Administrative Agent, for the account of each Lender, a commitment fee for each
calendar quarter (or portion thereof) for the period from the date of this Agreement to the Termination Date, at a per annum
rate of 0.50% on such Lender’s Applicable Percentage of the average daily aggregate Unutilized Commitments, payable in
arrears (i) on the last Business Day of each calendar quarter, beginning with March 30, 2018, and (ii) on the Termination
Date; provided, however, that no commitment fee shall accrue on the Unutilized Commitment of a Defaulting Lender
during any period that such Lender shall be a Defaulting Lender;
 


40 
 

 
(b)       
(i) to the Administrative Agent and the Arranger, for their own respective accounts, fees in the amounts and at the times specified
in the Fee Letter and (ii) to the Lenders such fees as have been separately agreed upon in writing in the amounts and at the times
so specified. Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever.
 
2.10       Method of Payments;
Computations; Apportionment of Payments.
 
(a)        All payments
by the Borrower hereunder shall be made without setoff, counterclaim or other defense, in Dollars and in immediately available
funds to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Lenders entitled to such payment (except as otherwise expressly provided
herein as to payments required to be made directly to the Lenders) in accordance with the Payment Instructions prior to 12:00 noon,
Charlotte, North Carolina time, on the date payment is due. Any payment made as required hereinabove, but after 12:00 noon, Charlotte,
North Carolina time, shall be deemed to have been made on the next succeeding Business Day. If any payment falls due on a day that
is not a Business Day, then such due date shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall
then be included in the computation of payment of interest, fees or other applicable amounts.
 
(b)       
The Administrative Agent will distribute to the Lenders like amounts relating to payments made to the Administrative Agent for
the account of the Lenders as follows: (i) if the payment is received by 12:00 noon, Charlotte, North Carolina time, in immediately
available funds, the Administrative Agent will make available to each relevant Lender on the same date, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, such Lender’s ratable share of such payment (based on the percentage that the amount of the relevant payment
owing to such Lender bears to the total amount of such payment owing to all of the relevant Lenders), and (ii) if such payment
is received after 12:00 noon, Charlotte, North Carolina time, or in other than immediately available funds, the Administrative
Agent will make available to each such Lender its ratable share of such payment by wire transfer of immediately available funds
on the next succeeding Business Day (or in the case of uncollected funds, as soon as practicable after collected). Notwithstanding
the foregoing or any contrary provision hereof, if any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it hereunder
to the Administrative Agent or the L/C Issuer, then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion, apply any amounts thereafter
received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender’s obligations to the Administrative
Agent or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.
 
(c)      
Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due
to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the L/C Issuer hereunder that the Borrower will not make such
payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and
may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, the amount due. In
such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the L/C Issuer, as the case may
be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or the
L/C Issuer, in immediately available funds, with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is
distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate
and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.
 


41 
 

 
(d)       
All computations of interest and fees hereunder (including computations of any reserve requirement reflected in the LIBOR Rate)
shall be made on the basis of a year consisting of 360 days; and in each case, with regard to the actual number of days (including
the first day, but excluding the last day) elapsed.
 
(e)        Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement or any other Credit Document to the contrary, all amounts collected or received by the Administrative
Agent or any Lender after acceleration of the Loans pursuant to Section 8.2 or in respect of any sale of, collection from
or other realization upon all or any part of the Collateral pursuant to the exercise by the Administrative Agent of its remedies
shall be applied by the Administrative Agent as follows:
 
     (i)       
 first, to payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting fees, indemnities, expenses and other amounts (including
fees, charges and disbursements of counsel to the Administrative Agent) payable to the Administrative Agent in its capacity as
such;
 
     (ii)       
second, to payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting fees, indemnities and other amounts (other than principal,
interest and L/C Participation Fees) payable to the Lenders and the L/C Issuer (including fees, charges and disbursements of counsel
to the respective Lenders and the L/C Issuer arising under the Credit Documents), ratably among them in proportion to the respective
amounts described in this clause second payable to them;
 
     (iii)      
third, to payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting accrued and unpaid L/C Participation Fees and interest
on the Loans, L/C Obligations and other Obligations arising under the Credit Documents, ratably among the Lenders and the L/C Issuer
in proportion to the respective amounts described in this clause third payable to them;
 
     (iv)       fourth, to payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting unpaid principal of the Loans, Reimbursement Obligations and funded
participations in Letters of Credit, and Obligations then owing under any Rate Management Agreement between any Credit Party and
any Rate Management Party (to the extent such Rate Management Agreement is required or permitted hereunder) and any Cash Management
Agreement between any Credit Party and any Cash Management Bank, and to the to the Administrative Agent for the account of the
L/C Issuer, to Cash Collateralize that portion of L/C Obligations comprised of the aggregate undrawn amount of Letters of Credit
to the extent not otherwise Cash Collateralized by the Borrower pursuant to the terms hereof, in each case ratably among the Administrative
Agent, the Lenders, the L/C Issuer, the Rate Management Parties and the Cash Management Banks in proportion to the respective amounts
described in this clause Fourth held by them;
 


42 
 

 
     (iv)      
fifth, to the payment of all other Obligations and other obligations that shall have become due and payable under the Credit
Documents or otherwise and not repaid; and
 
     (v)       
sixth, to the payment of the surplus (if any) to whomever may be lawfully entitled to receive such surplus.
 
Subject to Section
2.18, amounts used to Cash Collateralize the aggregate undrawn amount of Letters of Credit pursuant to clause Fourth above
shall be applied to satisfy drawings under such Letters of Credit as they occur. If any amount remains on deposit as Cash Collateral
after all Letters of Credit have either been fully drawn or expired, such remaining amount shall be applied to the other Obligations,
if any, in the order set forth above. Excluded Swap Obligations with respect to any Guarantor shall not be paid with amounts received
from such Guarantor or its assets, but appropriate adjustments shall be made with respect to payments from other Credit Parties
to preserve the allocation to Obligations otherwise set forth above in this Section.
 
Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Obligations arising under Rate Management Agreements and Cash Management Agreements shall be excluded from the application
described above if the Administrative Agent has not received a notice of such Obligations, together with such supporting documentation
as the Administrative Agent may request, from the applicable Cash Management Bank or Rate Management Party, as the case may be.
Each Cash Management Bank or Rate Management Party not a party to this Agreement that has given the notice contemplated by the
preceding sentence shall, by such notice, be deemed to have acknowledged and accepted the appointment of the Administrative Agent
pursuant to the terms of Article IX for itself and its Affiliates as if a “Lender” party hereto.
 
2.11       Recovery of
Payments.
 
(a)         The Borrower
agrees that to the extent the Borrower makes a payment or payments to or for the account of the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer
or any Lender, which payment or payments or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential,
set aside or required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party under any Debtor Relief Law, common law or equitable
cause (whether as a result of any demand, settlement, litigation or otherwise), then, to the extent of such payment or repayment,
the Obligation intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not been
received.
 
(b)       
If any amounts distributed by the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the L/C Issuer are subsequently returned or repaid by the
Administrative Agent to the Borrower, its representative or successor in interest, or any other Person, whether by court order,
by settlement approved by the Lender in question, or pursuant to applicable Requirements of Law, such Lender or the L/C Issuer,
as the case may be, will, promptly upon receipt of notice thereof from the Administrative Agent, pay the Administrative Agent such
amount. If any such amounts are recovered by the Administrative Agent from the Borrower, its representative or successor in interest
or such other Person, the Administrative Agent will redistribute such amounts to the Lenders or the L/C Issuer, as the case may
be, on the same basis as such amounts were originally distributed.

2.12      Use of Proceeds.
The proceeds of the Loans shall be used (i) to repay the Terminating Indebtedness in full, (ii) to pay or reimburse permitted fees
and expenses in connection with the Transactions and (iii) to finance acquisitions in accordance with the terms and provisions
of this Agreement of Projects that are or are reasonably expected to become Borrowing Base Projects, from third parties or from
Affiliates, including by reimbursing (in an amount not to exceed the prior purchase price) the Credit Parties for the prior acquisition
of a Project with equity (regardless of when such acquisition occurred). The proceeds of the L/C Credit Extensions shall be used
for purposes of maintaining the Reserves and other general corporate purposes related to the Projects.
 
2.13       Pro Rata Treatment.
 
(a)        All funding

) or on the basis
of their respective outstanding Loans of such Class (in the event the Commitments for Loans of such Class have expired or have
been terminated), as the case may be from time to time. All payments on account of principal of or interest on any Loans, fees
or any other Obligations owing to or for the account of any one or more Lenders shall be apportioned ratably among such Lenders
in proportion to the amounts of such principal, interest, fees or other Obligations owed to them respectively.
 
(b)       
If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any
principal of or interest on any of its Loans or other Obligations hereunder resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a
proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and accrued interest thereon or other such Obligations greater than its pro
rata share thereof as provided herein, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (i) notify the
Administrative Agent of such fact and (ii) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and such other
Obligations of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such
payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest
on their respective Loans and other amounts owing them; provided that (A) if any such participations are purchased and
all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase
price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (B) the provisions of this Section 2.13(b) shall
not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of
this Agreement (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender) or (y) any payment
obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations
in L/C Obligations to any assignee or Participant, other than to any Credit Party or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as
to which the provisions of this Section 2.13(b) shall apply). The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to
the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing
arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully
as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation. If under any applicable Debtor
Relief Laws, any Lender receives a secured claim in lieu of a setoff to which this Section 2.13(b) applies, such
Lender shall, to the extent practicable, exercise its rights in respect of such secured claim in a manner consistent with the
rights of the Lenders entitled under this Section 2.13(b) to share in the benefits of any recovery on such
secured claim.

2.14         Increased Costs;
Change in Circumstances; Illegality.
 
(a)             If any Change in Law shall:
 
(i)         impose,
modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge, liquidity requirement or similar requirement
against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve
requirement reflected in the LIBOR Rate) or the L/C Issuer;
 
(ii)       
subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes des

her liabilities or capital attributable thereto; or
 
(iii)       
impose on any Lender or the L/C Issuer or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense (other than Taxes) affecting
this Agreement or LIBOR Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;
 
and the result of any of the foregoing
shall be to increase the cost to such Lender or such other Recipient of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any LIBOR
Loan or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan, or to increase the cost to such Lender or the L/C Issuer of participating
in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of Credit),
or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or the L/C Issuer or such other Recipient hereunder (whether
of principal, interest or any other amount), then, upon request of such Lender or the L/C Issuer or other Recipient, the Borrower
will pay to such Lender, the L/C Issuer or such other Recipient, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will
compensate such Lender, the L/C Issuer or other Recipient, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction
suffered.
 
(b)       
If any Lender or the L/C Issuer determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or the L/C Issuer or any Lending
Office of such Lender or such Lender’s or the L/C Issuer’s holding company, if any, regarding capital or
liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s or the L/C
Issuer’s capital or on the capital of such Lender’s or the L/C Issuer’s holding company, if any, as a
consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit
held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the L/C Issuer, to a level below that which such Lender or the L/C
Issuer or such Lender’s or the L/C Issuer’s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law
(taking into consideration such Lender’s or the L/C Issuer’s policies and the policies of such Lender’s or
the L/C Issuer’s holding company with respect to capital adequacy and liquidity), then from time to time the Borrower
will pay to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such
Lender or the L/C Issuer or such Lender’s or the L/C Issuer’s holding company for any such reduction
suffered.
 


45 
 

 
(c)        A certificate
of a Lender or the L/C Issuer setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer or its
holding company, as the case may be, as specified in Section 2.14(a) or 2.14(b) and delivered to the Borrower shall
be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, the amount shown
as due on any such certificate within ten days after receipt thereof.
 
(d)       
Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the L/C Issuer to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this
Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s or the L/C Issuer’s right to demand such compensation; provided
that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or the L/C Issuer pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section
for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine months prior to the date that such Lender or the L/C Issuer,
as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender’s
or the L/C Issuer’s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased
costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive
effect thereof).
 
(e)        If, on or prior
to the first day of any Interest Period, (y) the Administrative Agent shall have determined that adequate and reasonable means
do not exist for ascertaining the applicable LIBOR Rate for such Interest Period or (z) the Administrative Agent shall have received
written notice from the Required Lenders of their determination that the rate of interest referred to in the definition of “LIBOR
Rate” upon the basis of which the Adjusted LIBOR Rate for LIBOR Loans for such Interest Period is to be determined will not
adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining LIBOR Loans during such Interest Period, the Administrative
Agent will forthwith so notify the Borrower and the Lenders. Upon such notice, (i) all then outstanding LIBOR Loans shall automatically,
on the expiration date of the respective Interest Periods applicable thereto (unless then repaid in full), be converted into Base
Rate Loans, (ii) the obligation of the Lenders to make, to convert Base Rate Loans into, or to continue, LIBOR Loans shall be suspended
(including pursuant to the Borrowing to which such Interest Period applies), and (iii) any Notice of Borrowing given at any time
thereafter with respect to LIBOR Loans shall be deemed to be a request for Base Rate Loans, in each case until the Administrative
Agent or the Required Lenders, as the case may be, shall have determined that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension
no longer exist (and the Required Lenders, if making such determination, shall have so notified the Administrative Agent), and
the Administrative Agent shall have so notified the Borrower and the Lenders.
 


46 
 

 
(f)         Notwithstanding
any other provision in this Agreement, if, at any time after the date hereof and from time to time, any Lender shall have
determined in good faith that the introduction of or any change in any applicable law, rule or regulation or in the
interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority charged with the interpretation or administration
thereof, or compliance with any guideline or request from any such Governmental Authority (whether or not having the force of
law), has or would have the effect of making it unlawful, or any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for
such Lender or its applicable Lending Office to perform any of its obligations hereunder or to make or to continue to make or
maintain LIBOR Loans, or charge interest with respect to any LIBOR Loan, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon
the LIBOR Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase
or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the London interbank market, such Lender will forthwith so notify the
Administrative Agent and the Borrower. Upon such notice, (i) each of such Lender’s then outstanding LIBOR Loans shall
automatically, on the expiration date of the respective Interest Period applicable thereto (or, to the extent any such LIBOR
Loan may not lawfully be maintained as a LIBOR Loan until such expiration date, upon such notice) and to the extent not
sooner prepaid, be converted into a Base Rate Loan (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if
necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the LIBOR Rate component
of the Base Rate), (ii) the obligation of such Lender to make, to convert Base Rate Loans into, to maintain, to continue or
charge interest with respect to LIBOR Loans shall be suspended (including pursuant to any Borrowing for which the
Administrative Agent has received a Notice of Borrowing but for which the Borrowing Date has not arrived), (iii) if such
notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the LIBOR Rate or making
or maintaining Base Rate Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the LIBOR Rate component of the Base
Rate, the interest rate on the Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by
the Administrative Agent without reference to the LIBOR Rate component of the Base Rate, and (iv) any Notice of Borrowing
given at any time thereafter with respect to LIBOR Loans shall, as to such Lender, be deemed to be a request for a Base Rate
Loan, in each case until such Lender shall have determined that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer
exist and shall have so notified the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent shall have so notified the
Borrower.
 
2.15       Taxes.
 
(a)            For purposes of this Section 2.15, the term “applicable
law” includes FATCA.
 
(b)          
Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Credit Party under any Credit Document shall be made without deduction
or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable law. If any applicable law (as determined in the good faith discretion
of an applicable Withholding Agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a Withholding Agent,
then the applicable Withholding Agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount
deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified
Tax, then the sum payable by the Borrower shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been
made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.15) the applicable
Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made.
 
(c)           The Credit
Parties shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law, or at the option of the Administrative
Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes.
 


47 
 

 
(d)       
The Credit Parties shall jointly and severally indemnify each Recipient, within 10 days after demand therefor, for the full amount
of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section
2.15) payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient and any reasonable
expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or
asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower
by a Lender or the L/C Issuer (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on
behalf of a Lender or the L/C Issuer, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
 
(e)        Each Lender
and the L/C Issuer shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified
Taxes attributable to such Lender or the L/C Issuer (but only to the extent that any Credit Party has not already indemnified the
Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Credit Parties to do so), (ii) any Taxes
attributable to such Lender’s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 10.6(e) relating to the maintenance
of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, in each case, that are payable
or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Credit Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with
respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.
A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive
absent manifest error. Each Lender and the L/C Issuer hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all
amounts at any time owing to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, under any Credit Document or otherwise payable
by the Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this Section
2.15(e).
 
(f)         As soon as
practicable after any payment of Taxes by any Credit Party to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section 2.15, such
Credit Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental
Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory
to the Administrative Agent.
 
(g)       Status of Lenders.
 
     (i)         Any
Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Credit
Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the
Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower
or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding.
In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other
documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable
the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or
information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion,
execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Sections 2.15(g)(ii)(A), 2.15(g)(ii)(B) and 2.15(g)(ii)(D))
shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject
such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of
such Lender.
 


48 
 

 
       (ii)        Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing:
 
(A)       any
Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender
becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative
Agent), executed copies of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax;
 
(B)       any
Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such
number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender
under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent),
whichever of the following is applicable:
 
(1)       
in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect
to payments of interest under any Credit Document, executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, as applicable, establishing
an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “interest” article of such tax treaty
and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Credit Document, executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E,
as applicable, establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “business profits”
or “other income” article of such tax treaty;
 
(2)        executed
copies of IRS Form W-8ECI;
 
(3)       
in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code,
(x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a “bank”
within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a “10 percent shareholder” of the Borrower within the meaning
of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a “controlled foreign corporation” described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the
Code (a “U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate”) and (y) executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, as applicable;
or
 


49 
 

 
(4)       
to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed copies of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI,
IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, as applicable, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-2 
or Exhibit H-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided
that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the
portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit
H-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner;
 
(C)       any
Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such
number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender
under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent),
executed copies of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal
withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit
the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and
 
(D)       if
a payment made to a Lender under any Credit Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such
Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b)
or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times
prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation
prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation
reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent
to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations
under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this Section 2.15(g)(ii)(D),
“FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
 
Each Lender agrees
that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update
such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do
so.
 


50 
 

 
(h)       
Unless required by applicable Laws, at no time shall the Administrative Agent have any obligation to file for or otherwise
pursue on behalf of a Lender or the L/C Issuer, or have any obligation to pay to any Lender or the L/C Issuer, any refund of
Taxes withheld or deducted from funds paid for the account of such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be. If any party
determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has
been indemnified pursuant to this Section 2.15 (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section
2.15), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity
payments made under this Section 2.15 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket
expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant
Governmental Authority with respect to such refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemn

at such indemnified party is
required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
2.15(h), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this Section
2.15(h) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the
indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been
deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had
never been paid. This Section 2.15(h) shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available
its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any
other Person.
 
(i)         Each
party’s obligations under this Section 2.15 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent
or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender or the L/C Issuer, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment,
satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Credit Document.
 
2.16      Compensation.
The Borrower will compensate each Lender upon demand for all losses, expenses and liabilities (including any loss, expense or
liability incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds required by such Lender to fund or
maintain LIBOR Loans) that such Lender may incur or sustain (i) if for any reason (other than a default by such Lender) a
Borrowing or continuation of a LIBOR Loan does not occur on a date specified therefor in a Notice of Borrowing, (ii) if any
repayment, prepayment or conversion of any LIBOR Loan occurs on a date other than the last day of an Interest Period
applicable thereto (including as a consequence of any assignment made pursuant to Section 2.17(a) or any acceleration
of the maturity of the Loans pursuant to Section 8.2), (iii) if any prepayment of any LIBOR Loan is not made on any
date specified in a notice of prepayment given by the Borrower or (iv) as a consequence of any other failure by the Borrower
to make any payments with respect to any LIBOR Loan when due hereunder. Calculation of all amounts payable to a Lender under
this Section 2.16 shall be made as though such Lender had actually funded its relevant LIBOR Loan through the purchase
of a Eurodollar deposit bearing interest at the LIBOR Rate in an amount equal to the amount of such LIBOR Loan, having a
maturity comparable to the relevant Interest Period; provided, however, that each Lender may fund its
LIBOR Loans in any manner it sees fit and the foregoing assumption shall be utilized only for the calculation of amounts
payable under this Section 2.16. A certificate (which shall be in reasonable detail) showing the bases for the
determinations set forth in this Section 2.16 by any Lender as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section
2.16 shall be submitted by such Lender to the Borrower either directly or through the Administrative Agent.
Determinations set forth in any such certificate made in good faith for purposes of this Section 2.16 of any such
losses, expenses or liabilities shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
 


51 
 

 
2.17       Mitigation
Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.
 
(a)            If any Lender
requests compensation under Section 2.14, or requires the Borrower to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to
any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.15, then such Lender shall
(at the request of the Borrower) use reasonable efforts to designate a different Lending Office for funding or booking its Loans
hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment
of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.14 or
2.15, as the case may be, in the future, and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and
would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred
by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
 
(b)           If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if the Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional
amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant Section 2.15 and, in each case,
such Lender has declined or is unable to designate a different Lending Office in accordance with Section 2.17(a), or if
any Lender is a Defaulting Lender or a Non-Consenting Lender, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice
to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and
subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 10.6), all of its interests, rights (other than
its existing rights to payments pursuant to Section 2.14 or 2.15) and obligations under this Agreement and the related
Credit Documents to an Eligible Assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender
accepts such assignment); provided that:
 
(i)         the
Borrower shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the assignment fee (if any) specified in Section 10.6(b)(iv);
 
(ii)       
such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and any funded participations
in Letters of Credit not refinanced through the Borrowing of Committed Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other
amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Credit Documents (including any amounts under Section 2.16) from the
assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other
amounts);
 
(iii)      
in the case of any such assignment resulting from a request for compensation under Section 2.14  or payments required
to be made pursuant to Section 2.15, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments
thereafter;
 
(iv)       such assignment
does not conflict with applicable Requirements of Law;  and
 


52 
 

 
(v)       
in the case of any assignment resulting from a Lender becoming a Non-Consenting Lender, the applicable assignee shall have consented
to the applicable amendment, waiver or consent.
 
A Lender shall not
be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the
circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.
 
2.18       Defaulting
Lenders.
 
(a)          Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as such
Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable law:
 
(i)           Such
Defaulting Lender’s right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall
be restricted as set forth in the definition of Required Lenders and in Section 10.5.
 
(ii)         
Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting
Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Article VIII or otherwise) or received by the Administrative
Agent from a Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 8.3 shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the
Administrative Agent as follows:
 
(A)       first,
to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder;
 
(B)       second, to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the L/C Issuer hereunder;
 
(C)       third, to Cash Collateralize the L/C Issuer’s Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender in accordance with Section
2.18(d);
 
(D)       fourth, as the Borrower may request (so long as no Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender
has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent;
 
(E)       fifth, if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to be held in a non-interest-bearing deposit account and released
pro rata in order to (1) satisfy such Defaulting Lender’s potential future funding obligations with respect to Loans under
this Agreement and (2) Cash Collateralize the L/C Issuer’s future Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender
with respect to future Letters of Credit issued under this Agreement, in accordance with Section 2.18(d);
 
(F)       sixth, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders or the L/C Issuer as a result of any judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction obtained by any Lender or the L/C Issuer against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting
Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement;
 


53 
 

 
(G)       seventh, so long as no Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its
obligations under this Agreement; and
 
(H)       eighth, to such Defaulting Lender or otherwise as may be required under the Credit Documents in connection with any Lien conferred thereunder
or otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction;
 
provided that
if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans or L/C Obligations in respect of which such Defaulting Lender
has not fully funded its appropriate share, and (y) such Loans were made or the related Letters of Credit were issued at a time
when the conditions set forth in Section 3.2 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans
of, and L/C Obligations owed to, all Non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis in accordance with their Applicable Percentages
prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of, or L/C Obligations owed to, such Defaulting Lender until such time as all
Loans and funded and unfunded participations in L/C Obligations are held by the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the Commitments
hereunder without giving effect to Section 2.18(a)(iv). Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a
Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant to
this Section 2.18(a)(ii) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents
hereto.
 
(iii)          (A)      No
Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive any commitment fee pursuant to Section 2.9(a) for any period during which
such Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and the Borrower shall not be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have been required
to have been paid to such Lender).
 
(B)      Each Defaulting
Lender shall be entitled to receive any L/C Participation Fee under Section 2.21(g) for any period during which that Lender
is a Defaulting Lender only to the extent allocable to its Applicable Percentage of the stated amount of Letters of Credit for
which it has provided Cash Collateral pursuant to Section 2.18(c).
 
(C)      With
respect to any L/C Participation Fee not required to be paid to any Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (B) above, the Borrower
shall (x) pay to each Non-Defaulting Lender that portion of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender with respect
to such Defaulting Lender’s participation in L/C Obligations that has been reallocated to such Non-Defaulting Lender pursuant
to Section 2.18(a)(iv), (y) pay to the L/C Issuer the amount of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender
to the extent allocable to the L/C Issuer’s Fronting Exposure to such Defaulting Lender and (z) not be required to pay the
remaining amount of any such fee.
 


54 
 

 
(iv)     All or any part of such Defaulting Lender’s participation in L/C Obligations shall automatically (effective on the day such
Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender) be reallocated among the Non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable
Percentages (calculated without regard to such Defaulting Lender’s Commitment) but only to the extent that such reallocation
does not cause the Credit Exposure of any Non-Defaulting Lender to exceed such Non-Defaulting Lender’s Commitment. Subject
to Section 10.16, no reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against
a Defaulting Lender arising from such Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a Non-Defaulting Lender
as a result of such Non-Defaulting Lender’s increased exposure following such reallocation.
 
(v)      If the reallocation described in Section 2.18(a)(iv) cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrower shall, without
prejudice to any right or remedy available to it hereunder or under law, Cash Collateralize the L/C Issuer’s Fronting Exposure
in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.18(d).
 
(b)       
If the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer agree in writing in their sole discretion that a Defaulting Lender
should no longer be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as
of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements
with respect to any Cash Collateral), such Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Loans
of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans and
funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit to be held on a pro rata basis by the Lenders in accordance with their
respective Applicable Percentages (without giving effect to Section 2.18(a)(iv)), whereupon such Lender will cease to be
a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made
by or on behalf of the Borrower while such Lender was a Defaulting Lender; provided further that, except to the extent otherwise
expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release
of any claim of any party hereunder arising from such Lender’s having been a Defaulting Lender.
 
(c)       At any time
that there shall exist a Defaulting Lender, or Cash Collateral is otherwise required hereby, within one Business Day following
the written request of the Administrative Agent or the L/C Issuer (or immediately, in the case of Cash Collateral required under
Section 8.2 hereof), the Borrower shall deliver Cash Collateral to the Administrative Agent in an amount sufficient to cover
all Fronting Exposure (determined after giving effect to Section 2.18(a)(iv) and any Cash Collateral provided by such Defaulting
Lender) with respect to such Defaulting Lender or to cover such other amount required hereby.
 
     (i)         All
Cash Collateral (other than credit support not constituting funds subject to deposit) shall be maintained in blocked,
non-interest bearing deposit accounts with the Administrative Agent. The Borrower, and to the extent provided by any Lender,
such Lender, hereby grants to (and subjects to the control of) the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the
Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and the Lenders, and agrees to maintain, a first priority security interest in all such
cash, deposit accounts and all balances therein, and all other property so provided as collateral pursuant hereto, and in all
proceeds of the foregoing, all as security for the obligations to which such Cash Collateral may be applied pursuant to Section
2.18(c)(ii). If at any time the Administrative Agent determines that Cash Collateral is subject to any right or claim of
any Person other than the Administrative Agent or the L/C Issuer as herein provided, or that the total amount of such Cash
Collateral is less than the applicable Fronting Exposure and other obligations secured thereby, or other amount required
hereby, the Borrower or the relevant Defaulting Lender will, promptly upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay or provide
to the Administrative Agent additional Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to eliminate such deficiency.
 


55 
 

 
     (ii)       
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Cash Collateral provided under this Section 2.18 or
any other provision hereof in respect of Letters of Credit shall be held and applied to the satisfaction of the specific L/C Obligations,
obligations to fund participations therein (including, as to Cash Collateral provided by a Defaulting Lender, any interest accrued
on such obligation) and other obligations for which the Cash Collateral was so provided, prior to any other application of such
property as may be provided for herein.
 
     (iii)       Cash
collateral (or the appropriate portion thereof) provided to reduce Fronting Exposure or to secure other obligations shall be released
promptly following (i) the elimination of the applicable Fronting Exposure or other obligations giving rise thereto (including
by the termination of Defaulting Lender status of the applicable Lender (or, as appropriate, its assignee following compliance
with Section 10.06) or (ii) the Administrative Agent’s good faith determination that there exists excess cash collateral
; provided, however, that (x) cash collateral furnished by or on behalf of a Credit Party shall not be released during the
continuance of a Default (and following application as provided in this Section 2.18 may be otherwise applied in accordance
with Section 2.13), (y) any such release shall be without prejudice to, and any disbursement or other transfer of Cash Collateral
shall be and remain subject to, any other Lien conferred under the Credit Documents and the other applicable provisions of the
Credit Documents, and (z) the Person providing cash collateral and the L/C Issuer may agree that cash collateral shall not be released
but instead held to support future anticipated Fronting Exposure or other obligations.
 
2.19      Approval and Initial Valuation
of Borrowing Base Projects.
 
(a)            Subject to
Section 2.19(g), the Borrower may from time to time before the Termination Date, and subject to the limitation set forth
in Section 2.19(g), request that the Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders designate any Project as a Borrowing
Base Project hereunder and assign a Project Value thereto by delivering to the Administrative Agent a written request (an “Approval
Request”) with respect to such Project that:
 
(i)       attaches
all Project Documents for such Project (in either executed or substantially final draft form, if not yet executed);
 


56 
 


 
(ii)          identifies
(A) each Person (including each Restricted Party and each Tax Credit Party, if any) that owns or manages any portion of such Project
and the ownership of the Capital Stock issued by each such Person and (B) whether such Project is a Tax Credit Project;
 
(iii)        
attaches pro forma financial statements for the Project, including a calculation (with supporting detail) of the debt service coverage
ratio therefor (as described in clause (b) below), which shall be in form and detail reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative
Agent; and
 
(iv)        
certifies that (A) such Project is a non-residential utility-scale solar power generation system that is located in the contiguous
United States and has achieved Commercial Operation; (B) the Project Documents attached to the Approval Request are true, correct
and complete in all material respects and, if executed, binding against each applicable Credit Party and, to the Borrower’s
knowledge, binding against the other parties thereto and in full force and effect; and (C) immediately after designating such Project
as a Borrowing Base Project with the assigned Project Value, the Borrower will be in compliance with the financial covenants contained
in Article VI, such compliance determined with regard to calculations made on a Pro Forma Basis for the Reference Period
then most recently ended for which the Administrative Agent has received the financial statements required by Section 5.1
(and a Compliance Certificate) and to be supported by accompanying calculations.
 
(b)         
Subject to Section 2.19(g), the Project Value for such Project (i.e., the aggregate principal amount of Loans that may be
advanced and Letters of Credit that may be issued (including the amount of any Letter of Credit issued as a contribution to any
Reserve) hereunder based on such Project) shall be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows:
 
(i)           in
the case of any Project for which the offtaker under the Power Purchase Agreement therefor is an investment grade or
equivalent offtaker (which may include a government entity or government financed entity or utility or such other Person as
reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent, provided that any such offtaker that is not an investment grade
offtaker must have been approved by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion), the aggregate principal amount Loans
that may be advanced and Letters of Credit that may be issued (including the amount of any Letter of Credit issued as a
contribution to the Reserve for such Project) hereunder based on such Project shall be determined by the amount of debt that
could support the maintenance (on a stand-alone basis for such Project) of minimum debt service coverage ratios of (i) 1.30
to 1.00 (in the case of a Tax Credit Project) or 1.25 to 1.00 (in the case of a Project that is not a Tax Credit Project)
using the projected net income of the Project (as confirmed by an Approved Engineer on a P50 basis) and (ii) 1.05 to 1.00 (in
the case of a Tax Credit Project) or 1.00 to 1.00 (in the case of a Project that is not a Tax Credit Project) using the
projected net income of the Project (as confirmed by an Approved Engineer on a P99 basis) (and using the aggregate principal
and interest payments that would be required to be made during such year if

Project was amortized (on a
“sculpted” basis taking into account seasonality of projected revenues based on the Approved Engineer’s
data for the Project) over a period equal to the greater of (A) the then-remaining term of the applicable Power Purchase
Agreement (not to exceed 15 years) and (B) 90% of the then-remaining term of the applicable Power Purchase Agreement (not to
exceed 23 years), and using an interest rate determined based on the applicable forward swap rate (plus 2.125%)
commercially available at the time of determination, for the period starting on the first anniversary of the Closing Date and
continuing until the Maturity Date, and based on such amortization period); and
 


57 
 

 
(ii)         
in the case of any Project for which the offtaker under the Power Purchase Agreement therefor is not an investment grade or equivalent
offtaker (which may include a government entity or government financed entity or utility or such other Person as reasonably determined
by the Administrative Agent, provided that any such offtaker that is not an investment grade offtaker must have been approved
by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion), the aggregate principal amount Loans that may be advanced and Letters of Credit
that may be issued (including the amount of any Letter of Credit issued as a contribution to the Reserve for such Project) hereunder
based on such Project shall be determined by the amount of debt that could support the maintenance (on a stand-alone basis for
such Project) of minimum debt service coverage ratios of (i) 1.45 to 1.00 (in the case of a Tax Credit Project) or 1.40 to 1.00
(in the case of a Project that is not a Tax Credit Project) using the projected net income of the Project (as confirmed by an Approved
Engineer on a P50 basis) and (ii) 1.20 to 1.00 (in the case of a Tax Credit Project) or 1.15 to 1.00 (in the case of a Project
that is not a Tax Credit Project) using the projected net income of the Project (as confirmed by an Approved Engineer on a P99
basis) (and using the aggregate principal and interest payments that would be required to be made during such year if

ch Project was
amortized (on a “sculpted” basis taking into account seasonality of projected revenues based on the Approved Engineer’s
data for the Project) over a period equal to the greater of (A) the then-remaining term of the applicable Power Purchase Agreement
(not to exceed 15 years) and (B) 90% of the then-remaining term of the applicable Power Purchase Agreement (not to exceed 20 years),
and using an interest rate determined based on the applicable forward swap rate (plus 2.125%) commercially available at the time
of determination, for the period starting on the first anniversary of the Closing Date and continuing until the Maturity Date,
and based on such amortization period); provided that the aggregate Project Values for all Borrowing Base Projects for which
the offtaker under the Power Purchase Agreement therefor is not an investment grade or equivalent offtaker shall not at any time
exceed 10% of the total Project Values of all Borrowing Base Projects.
 
(c)           The
Administrative Agent shall distribute each Approval Request to the Lenders, including the proposed Project Value as
determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with the foregoing clause (b). Each Lender shall review and determine in
its sole and absolute discretion whether to approve in its entirety an Approval Request (which such approval indicates an
agreement to designate the applicable Project as a Borrowing Base Project with the proposed Project Value), and shall give
the Administrative Agent written notice of its decision within 10 Business Days following the date of the Approval Request.
Any Lender that does not deliver a timely approval of an Approval Request or delivers an acceptance thereof that is qualified
in any manner (including with respect to the proposed Project Value) shall be deemed to have rejected such Approval
Request.
 


58 
 

 
(d)          
Subject to Section 2.19(g), in addition to the receipt of an Approval Request in accordance with the foregoing, the assignment
of a Project Value in accordance with this Section and the approval of the Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders in accordance
with this Section, the designation of any Project as a Borrowing Base Project hereunder shall be subject to the following conditions
and terms:
 
(i)          
consents to collateral assignment of the Project Documents and Project Warranties shall have been obtained from such third parties
as the Administrative Agent requires;
 
(ii)         
the Administrative Agent shall have received satisfactory evidence that the Borrower shall have contributed to such Project (as
equity) an amount such that the aggregate equity contributions by the Borrower to all Borrowing Base Projects (including the Projects
proposed to be designated as Borrowing Base Projects in the relevant Approval Request) are no less than 20% of the total transaction
costs to acquire such Projects;
 
(iii)         the Administrative
Agent shall have received satisfactory evidence that a Reserve for such Project has been Fully Funded; and
 
(iv)         the
Administrative Agent shall be reasonably satisfied with title and other matters relating to real estate for the Project and shall
have received an executed Mortgage (except in the case of Excluded Projects and, if agreed by the Administrative Agent in accordance
with Section 5.10, Tax Credit Projects) and such Real Property Support Documents with respect thereto as the Administrative
Agent requires, subject to the Mortgage Tax Principles.
 
(e)           If the Administrative
Agent and the Required Lenders approve any Approval Request in its entirety in accordance with Section 2.19(b) and the other
conditions to qualification as a Borrowing Base Project are satisfied, then the Project identified in such Approval Request shall
be deemed a Borrowing Base Project having the proposed Project Value assigned in accordance with this Section, effective as of
the date that (i) the Administrative Agent notifies the Lenders and the Borrower thereof and (ii) the applicable conditions and
requirements of Sections 5.9 and 5.10 are satisfied with respect to such Project.
 


59 
 

 
(f)            Each
Closing Date Borrowing Base Project that is designated as a Borrowing Base Project shall be an approved Borrowing Base
Project and shall have the Project Value assigned thereto as set forth on Schedule 1.1(b) (or as adjusted thereafter
in accordance with Section 2.20). No conditions set forth in Section 2.19 to designate a Project as a Borrowing Base
Project shall be applicable to a Closing Date Borrowing Base Project. Each Pre-Approved Borrowing Base Project is approved to
become a Borrowing Base Project after the Closing Date and shall, upon becoming a Borrowing Base Project after the Closing
Date, have the Project Value assigned thereto as set forth on Schedule 1.1(e) (as adjusted as described on such Schedule
1.1(e) or as adjusted thereafter in accordance with Section 2.20). The Borrower shall not be required to submit a
request that the Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders approve a Project Value for any Pre-Approved Borrowing Base
Project after the Closing Date, but each Pre-Approved Borrowing Base Project shall only become a Borrowing Base Project after
the Closing Date when (i) the Borrower has satisfied the conditions set forth in Section 2.19(a)(i) through Section 2.19(a)(iv) to the extent such information
or documentation has not previously been delivered to Administrative Agent, (ii) the Borrower has satisfied the applicable conditions
and requirements of Sections 5.9 and 5.10 and (iii) except for those Pre-Approved Borrowing Base Projects set forth
on Schedule 1.1(e)(i), the Administrative Agent is reasonably satisfied with title and other matters relating to real estate
for the Project (but without requiring any documentation or information related to the real estate for such Project that is not
available to the Credit Parties using commercially reasonable efforts and that is not material to the operation of the Project
as reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent), and upon satisfaction of all the foregoing conditions such Pre-Approved
Borrowing Base Project shall be deemed a Borrowing Base Project having the proposed Project Value assigned thereto as set forth
on Schedule 1.1(e) (as adjusted as described on such Schedule 1.1(e) or as adjusted thereafter in accordance with
Section 2.20), effective as of the date that the Administrative Agent notifies the Lenders and the Borrower thereof (it
being acknowledged, for the avoidance of doubt, that prior to becoming a Borrowing Base Project in accordance with the foregoing,
a Pre-Approved Borrowing Base Project shall not be part of the Borrowing Base or contribute in any way to borrowing availability
hereunder); provided that the Administrative Agent may require satisfactory evidence that a Reserve for such Project has
been Fully Funded prior to any borrowing hereunder that is based on the Project Value attributed to such Project.
 
(g)          
The Borrower may only submit Approval Requests on a single Business Day during each calendar month. For purposes of clarity, the
Borrower may submit multiple Approval Requests on a single Business Day in a given calendar month, but it must submit all Approval
Requests for each calendar month on the same Business Day. In addition, the Administrative Agent may reject an Approval Request
for a particular Project to become a Borrowing Base Project if, except in the case of the Specified Offtakers, the aggregate Project
Values with respect to Borrowing Base Projects for which the offtaker under the Power Purchase Agreement therefor is the same offtaker
(or an affiliate thereof) would exceed 33% of the aggregate Project Values for all Borrowing Base Projects at such time after giving
effect to the designation of such Project as a Borrowing Base Project (and any such rejection by the Administrative Agent on such
basis shall be an effective rejection of such Project notwithstanding any contrary approval by the Lenders).
 
2.20         Revaluation
of Project Values.
 
(a)
          If at any time and from time to time the Administrative Agent
shall have received notice from the Required Lenders of their reasonable determination that any material permanent physical
change in the structural integrity of any Borrowing Base Project has occurred (including, for example, the decommissioning of
a portion thereof or occurrence of a Material Casualty Event affecting a portion thereof), then the Administrative Agent
shall forthwith so notify in writing the Borrower and the Lenders (such notice from the Administrative Agent, a
“Revaluation Notice”). Each Revaluation Notice shall include, with respect to each Borrowing Base Project
identified therein, the proposed revised Project Value for such Borrowing Base Project as determined by the Administrative
Agent. Any such proposed revised Project Value shall be determined in accordance with Section 2.19(b) above, based on
the Borrowing Base Project giving effect to such material permanent physical change, and the Administrative Agent shall be
entitled to require (i) updated projected financial statements for the Project (giving effect to the permanent
physical change in the structural integrity of such Borrowing Base Project that has occurred) which shall include an updated
calculation (with supporting detail) of the debt service coverage ratio therefor (as described in Section 2.19(b)
above) and shall be in form and detail reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, and (ii) an updated report from
an Approved Engineer with respect to such Borrowing Base Project in scope and substance satisfactory to the Administrative
Agent.
 


60 
 

 
(b)          
Each Lender shall review and determine in its sole and absolute discretion whether to approve each revised Project Value set forth
in a Revaluation Notice, and shall give the Administrative Agent written notice of its decision within 10 Business Days following
the date of the Revaluation Notice. Any Lender that does not deliver a timely response to any Revaluation Notice shall be deemed
to have approved such Revaluation Notice (including each Project Value set forth therein) in its entirety.
 
(c)           If the Required
Lenders approve (or are deemed to have approved) any Project Value set forth in a Revaluation Notice in accordance with Section
2.20(b), then such Project Value shall be assigned to the applicable Borrowing Base Project and the Borrowing Base shall be
recalculated, effective as of the date that the Administrative Agent notifies the Lenders and the Borrower thereof.
 
2.21         Letters of
Credit.
 
(a)           Subject to
the terms and conditions hereof, as part of the Commitments, the L/C Issuer shall issue standby letters of credit providing for
the payment of cash upon the honoring of a presentation thereunder (each a “Letter of Credit”) for the Borrower’s
and any of its’ Subsidiaries’ account (and to amend or extend Letters of Credit previously issued by it) in an aggregate
undrawn face amount up to the L/C Sublimit; provided, however, that no such issuance, amendment or extension shall be made
if, immediately after giving effect thereto, (x) the Credit Exposure of any Lender would exceed its Commitment at such time or
(y) the Aggregate Credit Exposure would exceed the Credit Limit at such time. Each Lender shall be obligated to reimburse the L/C
Issuer for such Lender’s Applicable Percentage of the amount of each drawing under a Letter of Credit. Each Letter of Credit
shall constitute usage of the Commitments on a non-revolving and dollar-for-dollar basis (and of the Commitment of each Lender
pro rata in an amount equal to its Applicable Percentage of the face amount of each Letter of Credit issued).
 
(b)          
At any time before the Termination Date, the L/C Issuer shall, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, at the request of the
Borrower, issue one or more Letters of Credit in Dollars, in form and substance acceptable to the L/C Issuer, with expiration
dates no later than 12 months from the date of issuance (or which are cancelable not later than 12 months from the date of issuance
and each renewal) in an aggregate face amount as set forth above, upon the receipt of a duly executed application for the relevant
Letter of Credit in the form then customarily prescribed by the L/C Issuer for the Letter of Credit requested (each an “Application”).
Notwithstanding anything contained in any Application to the contrary: (i) the Borrower shall pay fees in connection with each
Letter of Credit as set forth in Section 2.21(g) and (ii) if the L/C Issuer is not timely reimbursed for the amount of
any drawing under a Letter of Credit on the date such drawing is paid, the Borrower’s obligation to reimburse the L/C Issuer
for the amount of such drawing shall bear interest (which the Borrower hereby promises to pay) from and after the date such drawing
is paid at a rate per annum equal to the Adjusted Base Rate from time to time in effect (computed on the basis of a year of 365
or 366 days, as the case may be, and the actual number of days elapsed). Without limiting the foregoing, the L/C Issuer’s
obligation to issue, amend or extend the expiration date of a Letter of Credit is subject to the terms or conditions of this Agreement
(including the conditions set forth in Section 3.2 and the other terms of this Section 2.21). Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, the L/C issuer shall be under no obligation to issue, extend or amend any Letter of Credit if any Lender
is at such time a Defaulting Lender hereunder unless it is satisfied that it will have no Fronting Exposure after giving effect
thereto. For the avoidance of doubt, the L/C Issuer shall have no obligation to issue, amend or extend any Letter of Credit from
and after the Termination Date, but Letters of Credit outstanding as of the Termination Date may remain outstanding after the
Termination Date pursuant to their terms (and subject to the other provisions hereof).
 


61 
 

 
(c)          
The obligation of the Borrower to reimburse the L/C Issuer for all drawings under a Letter of Credit (a “Reimbursement
Obligation”) shall be governed by the Application related to such Letter of Credit and this Agreement, except that reimbursement
shall be paid by no later than 12:00 Noon (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on the date which each drawing is to be paid if the
Borrower has been informed of such drawing by the L/C Issuer on or before 11:30 a.m. (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on the date
when such drawing is to be paid or, if notice of such drawing is given to the Borrower after 11:30 a.m. (Charlotte, North Carolina
time) on the date when such drawing is to be paid, by the end of such day, in all instances in immediately available funds at
such office as the Administrative Agent may designate in writing to the Borrower, and the Administrative Agent shall thereafter
cause to be distributed to the L/C Issuer such amount(s) in like funds. If the Borrower does not make any such reimbursement payment
on the date due and the Lenders fund their participations in the manner set forth in Section 2.21(d) below, then all payments
thereafter received by the Administrative Agent in discharge of any of the relevant Reimbursement Obligations shall be distributed
in accordance with Section 2.21(d) below. In addition, for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and
each Lender, the Borrower agrees that, notwithstanding any provision of any Application, its obligations under this Section
2.21(c) and each Application shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement and the relevant Application, under all circumstances whatsoever, and irrespective of any claim
or defense that the Borrower may otherwise have against the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or any Lender, including (i)
any lack of validity or enforceability of any Credit Document; (ii) any amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from
all or any of the provisions of any Credit Document; (iii) the existence of any claim, set-off, defense, or other right of the
Borrower may have at any time against a beneficiary of a Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom a beneficiary may be acting),
the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer, any Lender or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, another Credit
Document, the transactions related to the Credit Documents or any unrelated transaction; (iv) any statement or any other document
presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein
being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; (v) payment by the L/C Issuer under a Letter of Credit against presentation to the
L/C Issuer of a draft or certificate that does not comply with the terms of the Letter of Credit, or (vi) any other act or omission
to act or delay of any kind by the Administrative Agent or the L/C Issuer, any Lender or any other Person or any other event or
circumstance whatsoever that might, but for the provisions of this Section 2.21(c), constitute a legal or equitable discharge
of the Borrower’s obligations hereunder or under an Application. None of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders or the L/C
Issuer shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of
Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding
sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication
under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation
of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the L/C Issuer; provided that the foregoing
shall not be construed to excuse the L/C Issuer from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed
to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower and each other Credit Party to the extent
permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by the L/C Issuer’s failure to exercise care when
determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto
expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the L/C Issuer (as determined by
a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment), the L/C Issuer shall be deemed to have exercised care
in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that,
with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit,
the L/C Issuer may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further
investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents
if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.
 


62 
 

 
(d)          
Each Lender severally and not jointly agrees to and does purchase from the L/C Issuer, and the L/C Issuer hereby agrees to
and does sell to each Lender, an undivided participating interest (a “Participating Interest”) to the
extent of its Applicable Percentage in each Letter of Credit issued by, and each Reimbursement Obligation owed to, the L/C
Issuer. Upon Borrower’s failure to pay any Reimbursement Obligation on the date and at the time required, or if the L/C
Issuer is required at any time to return to the Borrower or to a trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian or other Person any
portion of any payment of any Reimbursement Obligation, each Lender shall, not later than the Business Day it receives a
notice thereof from the L/C Issuer (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) to such effect, if such certificate is received
before 1:00 p.m. (Charlotte, North Carolina time), or not later than 1:00 p.m. (Charlotte, North Carolina time) the following
Business Day, if such certificate is received after such time, pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C
Issuer an amount equal to such Lender’s Applicable Percentage of such unpaid or recaptured Reimbursement Obligation
together with interest on such amount accrued from the date the L/C Issuer made the related payment to the date of such
payment by such Lender at a rate per annum equal to: (i) from the date the L/C Issuer made the related payment to the date
two Business Days after payment by such Lender is due hereunder, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate
determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation for each such day
and (ii) from the date two Business Days after the date such payment is due from such Lender to the date such payment is made
by such Lender, the Base Rate in effect for each such day. Each such Lender shall, after making its appropriate payment, be
entitled to receive its Applicable Percentage of each payment received in respect of the relevant Reimbursement Obligation
and of interest paid thereon, with the L/C Issuer retaining its Applicable Percentage thereof as a Lender hereunder. The
several obligations of the Lenders to the L/C Issuer under this Section 2.21 shall be absolute, irrevocable and
unconditional under any and all circumstances and shall not be subject to any set off, counterclaim or defense to payment
which any Lender may have or has had against the Borrower, the L/C Issuer, the Administrative Agent, any other Lender or any
other Person. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, such obligations shall not be affected by any Default or
Event of Default (or by any reduction or termination of the Commitment of any Lender with respect to Letters of Credit
issued prior to such reduction or termination), and each payment by a Lender under this Section 2.21 shall be made
without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.
 


63 
 

 
(e)           Each Lender
shall, severally, to the extent of its Applicable Percentage, indemnify the L/C Issuer (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower)
against any cost, expense (including reasonable counsel fees and disbursements), claim, demand, action, loss or liability (except
such as result from the L/C Issuer’s gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction
by final and nonappealable judgment) that the L/C Issuer may suffer or incur in connection with any Letter of Credit issued by
it. The obligations of the Lenders under this Section 2.21(e) and all other parts of this Section 2.21 shall survive
termination of this Agreement, all other Credit Documents, all Applications, all Letters of Credit and all drafts and other documents
presented in connection with drawings thereunder.
 
(f)            The Borrower
shall provide at least three Business Days’ advance written notice to the Administrative Agent (or such lesser notice as
the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer may agree in their sole discretion) of each request for the issuance, amendment or
extension of a Letter of Credit, each such notice to be accompanied by a properly completed and executed Application for the requested
Letter of Credit and, in the case of an extension or amendment or an increase in the amount of a Letter of Credit, a written request
therefor, in a form acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer, in each case, together with the fees called for
by this Agreement. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the L/C Issuer of the Administrative Agent’s receipt of
each such notice (and the L/C Issuer shall be entitled to assume that the conditions precedent to any such issuance, extension,
amendment or increase have been satisfied unless notified to the contrary by the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders)
and the L/C Issuer shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Lenders of the issuance of a Letter of Credit.
 
(g)          
The Borrower shall pay to the L/C Issuer for its own account a fronting fee with respect to each Letter of Credit at a rate
equal to .125% per annum, computed on the daily amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit and payable on a
quarterly basis in arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June, September, and December; provided that such
fronting fees will accrue only during any period in which there is more than one Lender. Quarterly in arrears, on the last
Business Day of each March, June, September, and December, commencing on the first such date occurring after the Closing
Date, the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Lenders according to their
Applicable Percentages (subject to Section 2.18), a letter of credit fee (the “L/C Participation
Fee”) for each Letter of Credit at a rate per annum equal to 2.125% (computed on the basis of a year of 360 days
and the actual number of days elapsed) times the daily amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. In addition,
the Borrower shall pay to the L/C Issuer for its own account the L/C Issuer’s standard issuance, drawing, negotiation,
amendment, transfer and other administrative fees for each Letter of Credit. Such standard fees referred to in the preceding
sentence may be established by the L/C Issuer from time to time. In addition, the Borrower shall pay directly to the L/C
Issuer for its own account the customary issuance, presentation, amendment and other processing fees, and other standard
costs and charges, of the L/C Issuer relating to letters of credit as from time to time in effect. Such customary fees and
standard costs and charges are due and payable on demand and are nonrefundable. Unless otherwise specified herein, the amount
of a Letter of Credit at any time (including for purposes of computing the daily amount available to be drawn under
any Letter of Credit) shall be deemed to be the stated amount of such Letter of Credit in effect at such time; provided, however, that with respect to any Letter of Credit that, by its terms or the terms of any Application or other document
related thereto, provides for one or more automatic increases in the stated amount thereof, the amount of such Letter of
Credit shall be deemed to be the maximum stated amount of such Letter of Credit after giving effect to all such increases,
whether or not such maximum stated amount is in effect at such time.
 


64 
 

 
(h)          
Notwithstanding that a Letter of Credit issued or outstanding hereunder is in support of any obligations of, or is for the account
of, a Subsidiary, the Borrower shall be obligated to reimburse the L/C Issuer hereunder for any and all drawings under such Letter
of Credit. The Borrower hereby acknowledges that the issuance of Letters of Credit for the account of Subsidiaries inures to the
benefit of the Borrower, and that the Borrower’s business derives substantial benefits from the businesses of such Subsidiaries.
 
(i)            In
the event of any conflict or inconsistency between this Agreement and the terms of any Application, the terms of this Agreement
shall control.
 
2.22         Incremental
Commitments. The Borrower may from time to time after the Closing Date, upon at least sixty (60) days’ prior written
notice to the Administrative Agent in each case, at any time prior to the Termination Date, increase the aggregate Commitments
(each such increase, an “Incremental Increase”) at the option of the Borrower by an agreement in writing entered
into by the Borrower, the other Credit Parties, the Administrative Agent and each Person (including any existing Lender) that agrees
to provide a portion of such Incremental Increase (each an “Incremental Amendment”); provided that.
 
(a)           the aggregate principal amount of all Incremental Increases
shall not exceed $100,000,000;
 
(b)          
each Incremental Increase shall be in a minimum amount of $20,000,000 and in integral multiples of $5,000,000 in excess thereof
(or such lesser amounts as the Administrative Agent may agree);
 
(c)           no existing
Lender shall be under any obligation to provide any portion of any Incremental Increase and any such decision whether to provide
any portion of any Incremental Increase shall be in such Lender’s sole and absolute discretion;
 
(d)          
no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, and no Default or Event of Default would exist after giving
effect to any Incremental Increase (and treating any Incremental Increase as fully drawn for such purpose), both on the date on
which such Incremental Increase is requested and on the date on which such Incremental Increase becomes effective;
 


65 
 

 
(e)          each Person
providing any Incremental Increase shall be a Lender or an institution that qualifies as an Eligible Assignee and is acceptable
to the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer, and the Administrative Agent shall have received (A) additional commitments in
respect of such requested Incremental Increase (each an “Incremental Commitment”) from such Persons and (B)
documentation from each Person providing an Incremental Increase evidencing its Incremental Commitment and its obligations under
this Agreement in form and substance acceptable to the Administrative Agent;
 
(f)           the Administrative Agent shall have received:
 
(i)          
a certificate of each Credit Party dated as of the effective date of such Incremental Increase, signed by a Responsible Officer
of such Credit Party acceptable to the Administrative Agent and (A) certifying and attaching such Credit Party’s articles
of incorporation or certificate of formation (or equivalent), bylaws or operating agreement (or equivalent), and resolutions adopted
by the board of directors or equivalent governing body of such Credit Party approving such Incremental Facility, and certifying
as to the incumbency of the Responsible Officers of such Credit Party authorized to act on its behalf in connection with such Incremental
Increase, and (B) in the case of the Borrower, certifying that, both immediately before and after giving effect to such Incremental
Increase, (x) the representations and warranties contained in Article IV and in the other Credit Documents are true and
correct on and as of the date of such Incremental Increase, with the same effect as if made on and as of such date (except to the
extent any such representation or warranty is expressly stated to have been made as of a specific date, in which case such representation
or warranty shall be true and correct as of such date), and (y) no Default or Event of Default exists;
 
(ii)        
a certificate executed by a Financial Officer of the Borrower or the Parent certifying and demonstrating that after giving effect
to the incurrence of such Incremental Increase (and treating such Incremental Increase as fully drawn for such purpose) the Borrower
is in compliance with the financial covenants contained in Article VI, calculated on a Pro Forma Basis for the Reference
Period most recently ended for which financial statements have been delivered under this Agreement in accordance with GAAP;
 
(iii)        such
amendments to the Security Documents as the Administrative Agent reasonably requests to cause the Security Documents to secure
the Obligations after giving effect to such Incremental Increase;
 
(iv)        to
the extent requested by the Administrative Agent, customary opinions of legal counsel (including local counsel in each relevant
jurisdiction) to the Credit Parties, addressed to the Administrative Agent and each Lender (including each Person providing an
Incremental Commitment), dated as of the effective date of such Incremental Increase; and
 
(v)        
such other documents and certificates it may reasonably request relating to the necessary authority for such Incremental Increase
and the validity of such Incremental Increase, and any other matters relevant thereto, all in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to the Administrative Agent;
 


66 
 

 
(g)      
    the terms and conditions (including interest rate, interest rate margins, fees (other than arrangement,
structuring, underwriting and similar fees not paid generally to all Lenders under such Incremental Increase), prepayment
terms and final maturity) of such Incremental Commitments shall be the same as the terms applicable to the Commitments
hereunder, and such Incremental Commitments shall constitute Commitments hereunder;
 
(h)           Schedule
1.1(a) shall be deemed revised to include any increase in the Commitments pursuant to this Section 2.22 and to include
thereon any Person that becomes a Lender with a Commitment pursuant to this Section 2.22; and
 
(i)           
on the effective date of such Incremental Increase, the existing Lenders with Commitments shall make such assignments (which assignments
shall not be subject to the requirements set forth in Section 10.06(b)) of the outstanding Loans and participation interests
in Letters of Credit to the Lenders providing such Incremental Commitments, and the Administrative Agent may make such adjustments
to the Register as are necessary, so that after giving effect to such Incremental Increase and such assignments and adjustments,
each Lender (including the Lenders providing such Incremental Commitments) will hold its pro rata share (based on its Applicable
Percentage of the increased aggregate Commitments) of outstanding Loans and participation interests in Letters of Credit.
 
The Incremental Commitments
and credit extensions thereunder shall constitute Commitments and credit extensions under, and shall be entitled to all the benefits
afforded by, this Agreement and the other Credit Documents, and shall, without limiting the foregoing, benefit equally and ratably
from the security interests created by the Security Documents and from the Guaranty. The Lenders hereby authorize the Administrative
Agent to enter into, and the Lenders agree that this Agreement and the other Credit Documents shall be amended by, such Incremental
Amendments to the extent the Administrative Agent and the Borrower deem necessary in order to establish Incremental Commitments
on terms consistent with and/or to effect the provisions of this Section 2.22. The Administrative Agent shall promptly
notify each Lender as to the effectiveness of each Incremental Amendment. This Section 2.22 shall supersede any provisions
in Section 2.13(b) or 10.5 to the contrary.

to have a Material Adverse Effect, and (iii) keep all material properties in good working order and condition (normal wear and
tear and damage by casualty excepted) and from time to time make all necessary repairs to and renewals and replacements of such
properties, except to the extent that any of such properties are obsolete or are being replaced or, in the good faith judgment
of the Borrower, are no longer useful or desirable in the conduct of the business of the Credit Parties.
 


 83
 

 
5.4       
Compliance with Laws. Each Credit Party will, and the Borrower will cause each of the Borrower’s Subsidiaries to,
comply in all respects with all Requirements of Law applicable in respect of the conduct of its business and the ownership and
operation of its properties, except to the extent the failure so to comply could not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.
 
5.5       
Payment of Obligations. Each Credit Party will, and the Borrower will cause each of the Borrower’s Subsidiaries to,
(i) pay, discharge or otherwise satisfy at or before maturity all liabilities and obligations as and when due (subject to any

5.6        Insurance.
 
(a)          Each
Restricted Party will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, (i) maintain with financially sound and reputable insurance
companies insurance with respect to its assets, properties and business, against such hazards and liabilities, of such types and

Each such policy of insurance shall contain a clause requiring the insurer to give not less than 30 days’ prior written
notice to the Administrative Agent before any cancellation of the policies for any reason whatsoever and shall provide that any
loss shall be payable in accordance with the terms thereof notwithstanding any act of any Restricted Party that might result in
the forfeiture of such insurance. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Restricted Party will (i) (A) maintain
flood hazard insurance on all Flood Hazard Properties, on such terms and in such amounts as required by the National Flood Insurance
Reform Act of 1994 or as otherwise required by the Administrative Agent, and (B) promptly notify the Administrative Agent if any
real property subject to a Mortgage is, or becomes, a Flood Hazard Property, and (ii) maintain all insurance required by the Project

 84
 

 
(b)       
Each Restricted Party will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, direct all insurers under policies of property and casualty
insurance on the Collateral to pay all proceeds payable thereunder directly to the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent
shall hold all such proceeds for the account of the Restricted Parties. So long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing,
and subject Section 2.6(e), the Administrative Agent shall, at the Borrower’s request, disburse such proceeds as
payment for the purpose of replacing or repairing destroyed or damaged assets, as and when required to be paid and upon presentation
of evidence satisfactory to the Administrative Agent of such required payments and such other documents as the Administrative
Agent may reasonably request. As and to the extent required by Section 2.6(e), and in any event upon and during the continuance
of an Event of Default, the Administrative Agent shall apply such proceeds as a prepayment of the Loans in the order and manner
provided in Section 2.6(g).
 
5.7       
Maintenance of Books and Records; Inspection. Each Credit Party will, and the Borrower will cause each of the Borrower’s
Subsidiaries to, (i) maintain adequate books, accounts and records, in which full, true and correct entries shall be made of all
financial transactions in relation to its business and properties, and prepare all financial statements required under this Agreement,
in each case in accordance with GAAP and in compliance with the requirements of any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction
over it, (ii) provide to the Administrative Agent, upon request, a complete and accurate listing of all electronic and other systems
by which the Credit Parties maintain any books, accounts and records, and provide all information necessary (including credentials,
passwords and authorizations) to permit the Administrative Agent to (A) access, duplicate and disseminate the information contained
therein and (B) in connection with an exercise of remedies after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default,
have exclusive control over such books, accounts and records, and (iii) permit employees or agents of the Administrative Agent
or any Lender to visit and inspect its properties and examine or audit its books, records, working papers and accounts and make
copies and memoranda of them, and to discuss its affairs, finances and accounts with its officers and employees and, upon notice

each of the Parent, Intermediate Holdco and the Borrower authorizes such accountants to discuss the finances and affairs of the
Credit Parties and their respective Subsidiaries), all at such times and from time to time, upon reasonable notice and during
business hours, as may be reasonably requested.
 
5.8       
Rate Management Agreements. Not later than fifteen (15) days after the date of any advance of Loans hereunder (including
the Closing Date), the Borrower shall have entered into or obtained, and the Borrower will thereafter maintain in full force and
effect, Rate Management Agreements in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, with Lenders or
other Persons acceptable to the Administrative Agent, the effect of which shall be to fix or limit interest rates payable by the
Borrower as to 100% of the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the Loans as of such date (and after giving effect to such
advance), for a period of not less than the remaining term of this Agreement. The Borrower will deliver to the Administrative
Agent, promptly upon receipt thereof, copies of such Rate Management Agreements (and any supplements or amendments thereto), and
promptly upon request therefor, any other information reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent to evidence its compliance
with the provisions of this Section 5.8.
 


 85
 

 
5.9

the fully executed acquisition agreement (including schedules and exhibits thereto) and other material documents and closing papers
delivered in connection therewith.
 
5.10      Subsidiaries
and Tax Credit Parties.
 
(a)          Within
thirty (30) days (or such longer period as the Administrative Agent agrees in its discretion) of the creation or direct or indirect
acquisition by any Restricted Party of any Subsidiary (other than an Excluded Tax Credit Subsidiary), each such new Subsidiary
(such Person, for purposes of this Section 5.10, the “subject Subsidiary”) shall execute and deliver
to the Administrative Agent (i) a joinder to the Guaranty, pursuant to which the subject Subsidiary shall become a Guarantor thereunder
and shall guarantee the payment in full of the Obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents
and the other obligations described therein, and (ii) a joinder to the Security Agreement and such of the other Security Documents,
as applicable, pursuant to which the subject Subsidiary shall become a party thereto and shall grant to the Administrative Agent
a first priority Lien upon and security interest in its accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, general intangibles and other
personal property as Collateral for its obligations under the Guaranty and the other obligations described therein, subject only
to Permitted Liens, and the Borrower shall, or shall cause the parent Credit Party that owns the Capital Stock of the subject
Subsidiary to, execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an amendment or supplement to the Security Agreement pursuant to
which all of the Capital Stock of the subject Subsidiary then held by the Borrower or such parent Credit Party shall be pledged
to the Administrative Agent, together, to the extent applicable, with the certificates evidencing such Capital Stock and undated
stock powers duly executed in blank. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of PCIP Solar LLC, PCIP Solar Lessee, LLC and their respective
Subsidiaries shall be required to become a Guarantor or join the Security Agreement pursuant to this Section 5.10(a) until
such time as the Pre-Approved Borrowing Base Project of such Person or its Subsidiaries shall become a Borrowing Base Project
in accordance with Section 2.19(f).
 
(b)          Concurrently
with the delivery of any document required by Section 5.10(a), the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent:
 
(i)       (A)
a copy of the certificate of incorporation (or other charter documents) of the subject Subsidiary, certified as of a date that
is acceptable to the Administrative Agent by the applicable Governmental Authority of the jurisdiction of incorporation or organization
of the subject Subsidiary, (B) a copy of the bylaws or similar organizational document of the subject Subsidiary, certified on
behalf of the subject Subsidiary as of a date that is acceptable to the Administrative Agent by the corporate secretary or assistant
secretary of the subject Person, (C) a certificate of good standing for the subject Subsidiary issued by the applicable Governmental
Authority of the jurisdiction of incorporation or organization of the subject Subsidiary and (D) copies of the resolutions of
the board of directors or stockholders or other equity owners, as applicable, of the subject Subsidiary authorizing the execution,
delivery and performance of the agreements, documents and instruments executed pursuant to Section 5.10(a) and any other
Credit Documents to which such subject Subsidiary will be a party, certified on behalf of the subject Subsidiary by an Authorized
Officer of the subject Person, all in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent;
 


 86
 

 
(ii)       
a report of Uniform Commercial Code financing statement, tax and judgment lien searches performed against such Subsidiary in each
jurisdiction in which the subject Subsidiary is incorporated or organized, and to the extent requested by the Administrative Agent,
any other jurisdiction where such subject Subsidiary has a place of business or maintains any assets, which report shall show
no Liens on its assets (other than Permitted Liens);
 
(iii)       a
certificate of the secretary or an assistant secretary of the subject Subsidiary as to the incumbency and signature of the officers
executing agreements, documents and instruments executed pursuant to Section 5.10(a) and any other Credit Documents to
which such subject Subsidiary will be a party;
 
(iv)      
to the extent requested by the Administrative Agent, favorable legal opinions of counsel (including local counsel, as applicable)
to the subject Subsidiary, addressing such matters regarding the subject Subsidiary and the agreements, documents and instruments
executed pursuant to Section 5.10(a) and any other Credit Documents to which such subject Subsidiary will be a party as
the Administrative Agent requires;
 
(v)       
a certificate as to the solvency of the subject Subsidiary, addressed to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, dated as of
the date of creation, acquisition or designation of the subject Subsidiary and in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
the Administrative Agent; and
 
(vi)      
evidence satisfactory to the Administrative Agent that no Default or Event of Default shall exist immediately before or after
the creation or acquisition of the subject Subsidiary or be caused thereby.
 
(c)         Each
Project Subsidiary (other than Closing Date Borrowing Base Projects, Pre- Approved Borrowing Base Projects and Excluded Tax Credit
Subsidiaries) shall cause all of its Realty to be subject to a recorded Mortgage (provided that such Mortgage requirement shall
not apply to any Excluded Project) and deliver to the Administrative Agent Real Property Support Documents with respect thereto,
in each case within thirty (30) days (or such longer period as the Administrative Agent agrees in its discretion) of (i) the date
such Project Subsidiary becomes a Guarantor, if such Project Subsidiary becomes a Guarantor after the Closing Date, or (ii) the
date such Project Subsidiary acquires such Realty, if such Realty is acquired after the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing
in this clause (c) or the above provisions of this Section 5.10, in the case of any Tax Credit Project, the Administrative
Agent may elect in its sole discretion not to require a Lien (including a Mortgage) on the property and assets thereof, and instead
require only a pledge of the Capital Stock of the relevant Project Subsidiary with respect to such Tax Credit Project owned by
the Credit Parties, where the Administrative Agent has determined that obtaining a Mortgage or a Lien on the other assets of such
Tax Credit Project is not possible or commercially unreasonable, and the Administrative Agent is satisfied with the cash flows
from such Tax Credit Project that are payable to the Credit Parties and that no modifications to the Project Documents are permitted
that will negatively impact the cash flows from such Tax Credit Project that are payable to the Credit Parties (but the Borrower
shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a title search and such other Real Property Support Documents as it requires with respect
to such Tax Credit Project). Further, with respect to jurisdictions with Mortgage Taxes, Mortgages (and amendments thereto) shall
be subject to the Mortgage Tax Principles.
 


 87
 

 
(d)       
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Credit Party shall collaterally assign to the Administrative Agent, as
security for the Obligations, all of its rights in all Project Documents and all Project Warranties, and shall obtain consents
to such collateral assignment from such counterparties to the Project Documents and third parties as the Administrative Agent
requires.
 
(e)        As
promptly as reasonably possible, the Borrower and its Subsidiaries will deliver any such other documents, certificates and opinions,
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, as the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders
may reasonably request in connection therewith and will take such other action as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request
to create in favor of the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders, a perfected security interest in the Collateral
being pledged pursuant to the documents described in this Section 5.10 and any other Credit Documents to be executed by
the subject Subsidiary.
 
(f)         Notwithstanding
the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.10, with respect to any Foreign Subsidiary, (i) the Capital Stock of such Foreign
Subsidiary will not be required to be pledged to the extent (but only to the extent) that (y) such Foreign Subsidiary is a Subsidiary
of a Foreign Subsidiary or (z) such pledge exceeds (in the case of a pledge of voting Capital Stock) 66% of the voting Capital
Stock of such Foreign Subsidiary, unless and to the extent that the pledge of greater than 66% of the voting Capital Stock of
such Foreign Subsidiary would not cause any materially adverse tax consequences to the Borrower, and (ii) such Foreign Subsidiary
will not be required to become a Subsidiary Guarantor if doing so would cause any materially adverse tax consequences to the Borrower
or the Parent, determined by whether the execution of the Guaranty by such Foreign Subsidiary would constitute an investment of
earnings in United States property under Section 956 (or any successor statute) of the Code which would trigger an increase in
the gross income of the Parent pursuant to Section 951 (or any successor provision) of the Code without corresponding credits
or other offsets.
 


 88
 

 
(g)       
Concurrently with the Acquisition by the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof (other than an Excluded Tax Credit Subsidiary) of
any Tax Credit Project, the Borrower will deliver to the Administrative Agent an agreement, duly executed by each Person that
owns any Capital Stock issued by any applicable Tax Credit Party, pursuant to which (i) such Tax Credit Party grants to the Administrative
Agent certain notice and cure rights with respect to the equipment lease for such Tax Credit Project, (ii) such Tax Credit Party
agrees to allow the Administrative Agent (or any designee thereof) to “step-in” to such lease (including by agreeing
that any foreclosure on any Capital Stock issued by any Person would not give rise to a termination of such lease, whether automatically,
at the election of such Tax Credit Party, or otherwise) and (iii) such Person agrees not to replace or remove the manager of such
Tax Credit Party notwithstanding any change of control of such Tax Credit Party (including as a result of any foreclosure on any
Capital Stock issued by such Tax Credit Party). Within 30 days after request therefor by the Administrative Agent (which request
shall be made in respect of any Tax Credit Project within 10 Business Days after the Borrower shall have delivered to the Administrative
Agent notice of the Acquisition of such Tax Credit Project in accordance with Section 7.5(i)), the Borrower will deliver
to the Administrative Agent, with respect to each Tax Credit Party (other than any Excluded Tax Credit Subsidiary) that owns or
manages any portion of such Tax Credit Project, the documents and other instruments required by this Section 5.10 as if
such Tax Credit Party was a “subject Subsidiary” (as defined in Section 5.10(a)). In connection with the foregoing
obligations of the Borrower, to the extent reasonably requested by any applicable Tax Credit Party or any equityholder thereof
(other than the Borrower or any Affiliate thereof), the Administrative Agent will execute and deliver a forbearance agreement,
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, pursuant to which it will agree, on behalf of the Lenders,
to forbear, on commercially reasonable terms, from foreclosing on certain assets of or related to any Tax Credit Project.
 
5.11     
Environmental Laws. The Borrower will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, (i) comply in all material respects

any, with, all applicable Environmental Laws and obtain and comply in all material respects with and maintain, and use commercially
reasonable efforts to ensure that all tenants and subtenants obtain and comply in all material respects with and maintain, any
and all licenses, approvals, notifications, registrations or permits required by applicable Environmental Laws, except to the
extent that the failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, and (ii) conduct and complete
all investigations, studies, sampling and testing, and all remedial, removal and other actions, required under Environmental Laws
and promptly comply in all material respects with all lawful orders and directives of all Governmental Authorities regarding Environmental
Laws, except to the extent that the same are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings or to the extent the failure
to conduct or complete any of the foregoing could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
 
5.12     
Public/Private Information. Each of the Parent and the Borrower will cooperate with the Administrative Agent in connection
with the publication of certain materials and/or information provided by or on behalf of the Credit Parties to the Administrative
Agent and Lenders pursuant to this Article V (collectively, the “Information Materials”) and will designate
Information Materials (i) that are either available to the public or not material with respect to the Parent and its Subsidiaries
for purposes of federal and state securities laws, as “Public Information” and (ii) that are not Public Information,
as “Private Information”.
 
5.13     
Compliance with Anti-Corruption Laws; Sanctions; PATRIOT Act. Each of the Parent, Intermediate Holdco and the Borrower
will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, (i) maintain in effect and enforce policies and procedures designed to ensure
compliance by the Parent, Intermediate Holdco, the Borrower, their respective Subsidiaries and their respective directors, officers,
employees and agents with Anti-Corruption Laws and applicable Sanctions, and (ii) provide, to the extent commercially reasonable,
such information and take such actions as are reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent or any Lender in order to assist
the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in maintaining compliance with the PATRIOT Act.

Further Assurances. Each Credit Party will, and the Borrower will cause each of the Borrower’s Subsidiaries to, make,
execute, endorse, acknowledge and deliver any amendments, modifications or supplements hereto and restatements hereof and any
other agreements, instruments or documents, and, to the extent such Person has executed the Security Documents, take any and all
such other actions, as may from time to time be reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders to perfect
and maintain the validity and priority of the Liens granted pursuant to the Security Documents and to effect, confirm or further
assure or protect and preserve the interests, rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders under this Agreement
and the other Credit Documents. The Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Lenders, shall execute and deliver such releases from
the Credit Documents necessary for and in connection with any Asset Disposition consummated in accordance with Section 7.4.
 
5.15     
Project Subsidiaries. The Borrower shall cause (i) each Project Subsidiary to take only such actions that are necessary
or incidental to the ownership, construction and operation of one or more Projects and (ii) each Borrowing Base Project to be
wholly-owned by one or more Project Subsidiaries or Tax Credit Parties (as set forth on Schedule 1.1(b) or in the applicable
Approval Notice submitted and approved in accordance with Section 2.19).

transfer all cash and Cash Equivalents in excess of such reasonable amount necessary to operate each applicable Project with respect
to each such Restricted Party (as reasonably determined by the Borrower and as agreed by the Administrative Agent) into deposit
accounts and securities accounts, as applicable, over which the Administrative Agent has control.
 
5.18     
Reserves. The Borrower shall use the Reserves for each Project only for the purposes identified in the definition of “Reserves”
herein, and shall, promptly after (a) use of any Reserve for any such purpose or (b) notification from the Administrative Agent
of its reasonable determination of an adjustment to the required minimum amount of the Reserve for any Project (as contemplated
by the definition of “Fully Funded” herein), replenish such Reserve such that it is Fully Funded.

right and such appointment and hereby waives any objection the Borrower or any Subsidiary may have thereto or the right to
have a bond or other security posted by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders, in connection therewith; and
 

 103
 

 
(e)              Exercise on
behalf of itself, the Lenders and the L/C Issuer all rights and remedies available to it, the Lenders and the L/C Issuer under
this Agreement, the other Credit Documents and applicable law.
 
8.3           Remedies:
Setoff. Upon and at any time after the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, each Lender, the L/C
Issuer and each of their respective Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, after obtaining the prior
written consent of the Administrative Agent, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, to set off and apply any and all
deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, in whatever currency) at any time held, and other obligations
(in whatever currency) at any time owing, by such Lender, the L/C Issuer or any such Affiliate, to or for the credit or the account
of the Borrower or any other Credit Party against any and all of the obligations of the Borrower or such Credit Party now or hereafter
existing under this Agreement or any other Credit Document to such Lender or the L/C Issuer or their respective Affiliates, irrespective
of whether or not such Lender, the L/C Issuer or such Affiliate shall have made any demand under this Agreement or any other Credit
Document and although such obligations of the Borrower or such Credit Party may be contingent or unmatured or are owed to a branch,
office or Affiliate of such Lender or the L/C Issuer different from the branch, office or Affiliate holding such deposit or obligated
on such indebtedness; provided that in the event that any Defaulting Lender shall exercise any such right of setoff, (x)
all amounts so set off shall be paid over immediately to the Administrative Agent for further application in accordance with the
provisions of Section 2.18 and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds
and deemed held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and the Lenders and (y) the Defaulting Lender
shall provide promptly to the Administrative Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the obligations owing to such Defaulting
Lender as to which it exercised such right of setoff. The rights of each Lender, the L/C Issuer and their respective Affiliates
under this Section 8.3 are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that such Lender,
the L/C Issuer or their respective Affiliates may have. Each Lender and the L/C Issuer agrees to notify the Borrower and the Administrative
Agent promptly after any such setoff and application; provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the
validity of such setoff and application.
 

 104
 

 
8.4        Equity
Cure. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 6.2, for purposes of determining whether an
Event of Default has occurred under the financial covenant set forth in Section 6.2 for any fiscal quarter, any
Capital Contribution made to, and actually received by, the Borrower after the last day of such fiscal quarter and on or
prior to the day on which financial statements are required to be delivered hereunder for such fiscal quarter will, at the
request of the Borrower (delivered to the Administrative Agent in the form of a Notice of Intent to Cure prior to the day on
which financial statements are required to be delivered hereunder for such fiscal quarter), be included in the calculation of
Consolidated EBITDA for the Restricted Parties solely for the purposes of determining compliance with the financial covenant
set forth in Section 6.2 at the end of such fiscal quarter and any subsequent period that includes such fiscal quarter
(any such equity contribution, a “Specified Capital Contribution”); provided that (i) no more than
two Specified Capital Contributions may be made during any fiscal year and no more than four Specified Capital Contributions
may be made during the term of this Agreement, (ii) Specified Capital Contributions may not be made in consecutive fiscal
quarters, (iii) the amount of any Specified Capital Contribution shall not exceed the lesser of (A) the amount required to
cause the Restricted Parties to be in compliance with such financial covenant for such fiscal quarter and (B) 10% of
Consolidated EBITDA (without giving effect to such Specified Capital Contribution) for the Reference Period to which such
Specified Capital Contribution relates, (iv) all Specified Capital Contributions will be disregarded for all other purposes
under this Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any other calculation of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio
hereunder) and the Credit Documents and shall not be deemed to have decreased Indebtedness for any period in which such
contribution increased Consolidated EBITDA, (v) the Net Cash Proceeds of each Specified Capital Contribution shall be applied
to prepay the principal balance of the Loans and (vi) upon the Administrative Agent’s receipt of a written notice from
the Borrower that it intends to exercise the cure right set forth in this Section 8.4 (a “Notice of Intent to
Cure”) (which Notice of Intent to Cure shall be irrevocable and must be delivered to the Administrative Agent
after the last day of the fiscal quarter in respect of which such cure right is to be exercised and on or prior to the day on
which financial statements are required to be delivered hereunder for such fiscal quarter), until the day on which the
financial statements have been or are required to be delivered hereunder for the fiscal quarter to which such Notice of
Intent to Cure relates, none of the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall exercise the right to accelerate the
Obligations and none of the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall exercise any right to foreclose on or take possession
of any Collateral solely on the basis of an Event of Default having occurred and being continuing under Section 8.1(b)
as a result of a breach of the financial covenant set forth in Section 6.2 (provided that an Event of Default
shall be deemed to have occurred during such period for all other purposes of this Agreement, including Section 3.2
hereof, and the other Credit Documents unless and until cured in accordance with this Section).
 
ARTICLE IX
 
THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT
 
9.1           Appointment
and Authority. Each of the Lenders and the L/C Issuer hereby irrevocably appoints Fifth Third to act on its behalf as
the Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Credit Documents and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such
actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof or
thereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Except as set forth in Section
9.6, the provisions of this Article IX are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the
L/C Issuer, and neither the Borrower nor any other Credit Party shall have rights as a third-party beneficiary of any of such
provisions. It is understood and agreed that the use of the term “agent” (or any other similar term) herein or in
any other Credit Document with reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other
implied (or express) obligations under agency doctrine of any applicable law. Instead, such term is used as a matter of
market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting parties. The
Administrative Agent shall also act as the “collateral agent” under the Credit Documents, and each of the Lenders
(including in its capacities as a potential Rate Management Party and a potential Cash Management Bank) and the L/C Issuer
hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent to act as the agent of such Lender and the L/C Issuer for
purposes of acquiring, holding and enforcing any and all Liens on Collateral granted by any of the Credit Parties to secure
any of the Obligations, together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto. In this connection,
the Administrative Agent, as “collateral agent” and any co-agents, sub-agents and attorneys-in-fact appointed by
the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 9.5 for purposes of holding or enforcing any Lien on the Collateral (or
any portion thereof) granted under the Security Documents, or for exercising any rights and remedies thereunder at the
direction of the Administrative Agent, shall be entitled to the benefits of all provisions of this Article IX and Article
X (including Section 10.1(c), as though such co-agents, sub-agents and attorneys-in-fact were the
“collateral agent” under the Credit Documents) as if set forth in full herein with respect thereto.
 

 105
 

 
9.2          
Rights as a Lender. The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its
capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and the term
“Lender” or “Lenders” shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires,
include the Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Such Person and its Affiliates may
accept deposits from, lend money to, own securities of, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and
generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were
not the Administrative Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders or to provide notice to or consent
of the Lenders with respect thereto.
 
9.3           Exculpatory
Provisions.
 
(a)              The Administrative
Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Credit Documents, and its
duties hereunder shall be administrative in nature. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent
and its Related Parties:
 
(i)           shall
not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing;
 
(ii)         
shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and
powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Credit Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise as
directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for
herein or in the other Credit Documents); provided that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action
that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent to liability or that is contrary to any
Credit Document or applicable law, including, for the avoidance of doubt, any action that may be in violation of the automatic
stay under any Debtor Relief Law or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a Defaulting Lender
in violation of any Debtor Relief Law; and
 
(iii)         shall
not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Credit Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable
for the failure to disclose, any information relating to any Credit Party or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained
by the Person serving as the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.
 

 106
 

 
(b)             
Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its Related Parties shall be liable for any action taken or not taken by the Administrative
Agent (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall
be necessary, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided
in Sections 10.5 and 8.2), or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined
by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have
knowledge of any Default or Event of Default unless and until notice describing such Default or Event of Default is given to the
Administrative Agent in writing by the Borrower or a Lender.
 
(c)              Neither the
Administrative Agent nor any of its Related Parties shall be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i)
any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Credit Document, (ii) the contents
of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the
performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence
of any Default or Event of Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other
Credit Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or the creation, perfection or priority of any Lien purported to
be created by the Security Documents, (v) the value or the sufficiency of any Collateral or (vi) the satisfaction of any condition
set forth in Article III or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered
to the Administrative Agent.
 
9.4         
Reliance by Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability
for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic
message, internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent
or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or
by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon.
In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, or the issuance, extension, renewal or increase
of a Letter of Credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or the L/C Issuer, the Administrative
Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender or the L/C Issuer unless the Administrative Agent shall have
received notice to the contrary from such Lender or the L/C Issuer prior to the making of such Loan or the issuance, extension,
renewal or increase of such Letter of Credit. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the
Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken
by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts. For purposes of determining compliance with the
conditions specified in Section 3.1, each Lender that has signed this Agreement shall be deemed to have consented to, approved
or accepted or to be satisfied with, each document or other matter required thereunder to be consented to or approved by or acceptable
or satisfactory to a Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from such Lender prior to the proposed Closing
Date specifying its objections.
 

 107
 

 
9.5           Delegation
of Duties. The Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or
under any other Credit Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent.
The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by
or through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub-agent and
to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in
connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.
The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any sub-agent except to the extent that
a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and nonappealable judgment that the Administrative Agent acted with
gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such sub-agent.
 
9.6           Resignation
of Administrative Agent.
 
(a)              The Administrative
Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders, the L/C Issuer and the Borrower. Upon receipt of any such
notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the Borrower, to appoint a successor, which
shall be a bank with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States. If no
such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after
the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders)
(the “Resignation Effective Date”), then the retiring Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to),
on behalf of the Lenders and the L/C Issuer, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above.
Regardless of whether a successor has been appointed or has accepted such appointment, such resignation shall become effective
in accordance with such note on the Resignation Effective Date.
 
(b)             
With effect from the Resignation Effective Date, (i) the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties
and obligations hereunder and under the other Credit Documents (except that in the case of any collateral security held by
the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders or the L/C Issuer under any of the Credit Documents, the retiring
Administrative Agent shall continue to hold such collateral security until such time as a successor Administrative Agent is
appointed) and (ii) except for any indemnity payments or other amounts then owed to the retiring Administrative Agent, all
payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be
made by or to each Lender and the L/C Issuer directly, until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor
Administrative Agent as provided for in Section 9.6(a). Upon the acceptance of a successor’s appointment as
Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges
and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent (other than any rights to indemnity payments or other amounts owed to the
retiring Administrative Agent), and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and
obligations hereunder or under the other Credit Documents (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this
Section). The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its
predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After the retiring Administrative Agent’s
resignation hereunder and under the other Credit Documents, the provisions of this Article IX  and Section 10.1
shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related
Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them (i) while the retiring Administrative Agent was
acting as Administrative Agent and (ii) after such resignation for as long as any of them continues to act in any
capacity hereunder or under the other Credit Documents, including, without limitation, (A) acting as collateral agent or
otherwise holding any collateral security on behalf of any of the Lenders and L/C Issuer and (B) in respect of any actions
taken in connection with transferring the agency to any successor Administrative Agent.
 

 108
 

 
(c)              Any resignation
by Fifth Third as Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section shall also constitute its resignation as L/C Issuer. If Fifth Third
resigns as L/C Issuer, it shall retain all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the L/C Issuer hereunder with respect to
all Letters of Credit outstanding as of the effective date of its resignation as L/C Issuer and all L/C Obligations with respect
thereto, including the right to require the Lenders to make Loans or fund risk participations pursuant to Section 2.21.
Upon the appointment by the Borrower of a successor L/C Issuer hereunder, (i) such successor shall succeed to and become vested
with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring L/C Issuer, (ii) the retiring L/C Issuer shall be discharged
from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Credit Documents, and (iii) the successor L/C Issuer shall
issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession or make other
arrangements satisfactory to Fifth Third to effectively assume the obligations of Fifth Third with respect to such Letters of Credit.
 
9.7         
Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Lenders. Each Lender and the L/C Issuer acknowledges that it has, independently
and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents
and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender
and the L/C Issuer also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other
Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate,
continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Credit Document
or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.
 
9.8           No
Other Duties, Etc. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, no Bookrunner, Arranger, Syndication Agent, Documentation
Agent or other agent or title listed on the cover page hereof shall have any powers, duties or responsibilities under this Agreement
or any of the other Credit Documents, except in its capacity, as applicable, as the Administrative Agent, a Lender or the L/C Issuer
hereunder.
 
9.9           Administrative
Agent May File Proofs of Claim. In case of the pendency of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or any other
judicial proceeding relative to any Credit Party, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan
or L/C Obligation shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective
of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered (but not
obligated) by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise (i) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the
principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans, L/C Obligations and all other Obligations that are owing and
unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders, the L/C
Issuer and the Administrative Agent (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and
advances of the Lenders, the L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent and their respective agents, sub-agents and counsel and
all other amounts due the Lenders, the L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.9, 2.21 and 10.1)
allowed in such judicial proceeding and (ii) to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on
any such claims and to distribute the same. Any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other
similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender and the L/C Issuer to make such payments
to the Administrative Agent and, in the event that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments to
the Lenders and the L/C Issuer, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses,
disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent and its agents, sub-agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the
Administrative Agent under Section 2.9 or 10.1.
 

 109
 

 
The Lenders and
the L/C Issuer hereby irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent, at the direction of the Required Lenders, to credit bid
all or any portion of the Obligations (including accepting some or all of the Collateral in satisfaction of some or all of
the Obligations pursuant to a deed in lieu of foreclosure or otherwise) and in such manner purchase (either directly or
through one or more acquisition vehicles) all or any portion of the Collateral (a) at any sale thereof conducted under the
provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, including under Sections 363, 1123 or 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code, or any similar laws in
any other jurisdictions to which a Credit Party is subject, and (b) at any other sale or foreclosure or acceptance of
collateral in lieu of debt conducted by (or with the consent or at the direction of) the Administrative Agent (whether by
judicial action or otherwise) in accordance with any applicable law. In connection with any such credit bid and purchase, the
Obligations owed to the holders thereof shall be entitled to be, and shall be, credit bid on a ratable basis (with
Obligations with respect to contingent or unliquidated claims receiving contingent interests in the acquired assets on a
ratable basis that would vest upon the liquidation of such claims in an amount proportional to the liquidated portion of the
contingent claim amount used in allocating the contingent interests) in the asset or assets so purchased (or in the Capital
Stock or debt instruments of the acquisition vehicle or vehicles that are used to consummate such purchase). In connection
with any such bid (i) the Administrative Agent shall be authorized to form one or more acquisition vehicles to make a bid,
(ii) to adopt documents providing for the governance of the acquisition vehicle or vehicles (provided that any actions by the
Administrative Agent with respect to such acquisition vehicle or vehicles, including any disposition of the assets or Capital
Stock thereof shall be governed, directly or indirectly, by the vote of the Required Lenders, irrespective of the
termination of this Agreement and without giving effect to the limitations on actions by the Required Lenders contained in
clauses (a) through (f) of Section 10.5 of this Agreement, (iii) the Administrative Agent shall be authorized to assign the
relevant Obligations to any such acquisition vehicle pro rata by the Lenders, as a result of which each of the Lenders shall
be deemed to have received a pro rata portion of any Capital Stock and/or debt instruments issued by such an acquisition
vehicle on account of the assignment of the Obligations to be credit bid, all without the need for any Lender or other holder
of the Obligations or acquisition vehicle to take any further action (which assignment shall not be subject to the
requirements for and limitations on assignments in Section 10.6, notwithstanding anything in Section 10.6 to
the contrary), and (iv) to the extent that Obligations that are assigned to an acquisition vehicle are not used to acquire
Collateral for any reason (as a result of another bid being higher or better, because the amount of Obligations assigned to
the acquisition vehicle exceeds the amount of debt credit bid by the acquisition vehicle or otherwise), such Obligations
shall automatically be reassigned to the Lenders pro rata and the Capital Stock and/or debt instruments issued by any
acquisition vehicle on account of the Obligations that had been assigned to the acquisition vehicle shall automatically be
cancelled, without the need for any Lender or other holder of the Obligations or any acquisition vehicle to take any further
action.
 

 110
 

 
9.10         Collateral
and Guaranty Matters.
 
(a)              The Administrative
Agent is hereby authorized on behalf of the Lenders and the L/C Issuer, without the necessity of any notice to or further consent
from the Lenders, the L/C Issuer or any other holder of the Obligations, from time to time (but without any obligation) to take
any action with respect to the Collateral and the Security Documents that may be deemed by the Administrative Agent in its discretion
to be necessary or advisable to perfect and maintain perfected the Liens upon the Collateral granted pursuant to the Security Documents.
The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have a duty to ascertain or inquire into any representation or warranty
regarding the existence, value or collectability of the Collateral, the existence, priority or perfection of the Administrative
Agent’s Lien thereon, or any certificate prepared by any Credit Party in connection therewith, nor shall the Administrative
Agent be responsible or liable to the Lenders, the L/C Issuer or any other holder of the Obligations for any failure to monitor
or maintain any portion of the Collateral.
 
(b)            
Each of the Lenders (including in its capacities as a potential Cash Management Bank and a potential Rate Management Party) hereby
irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent, at its option and in its discretion, (i) to release any Lien on any property granted
to or held by the Administrative Agent under any Credit Document (A) upon termination of the Commitments and payment in full of
all of the Obligations (other than (x) contingent indemnification obligations and (y) Obligations owing to any Rate Management
Party or Cash Management Bank under or in connection with any Rate Management Agreement or Cash Management Agreement), (B) that
is sold or otherwise disposed of or to be sold or otherwise disposed of as part of or in connection with any sale or other disposition
permitted under the Credit Documents or (C) subject to Section 10.5, if approved, authorized or ratified in writing by the
Required Lenders; (ii) to subordinate any Lien on any property granted to or held by the Administrative Agent under any Credit
Document to the holder of any Lien on such property that is permitted by Section 7.3(vi); and (iii) to release any Guarantor
from its obligations under the Credit Documents if such Person ceases to be a Subsidiary as a result of a transaction permitted
under the Credit Documents. Upon request by the Administrative Agent at any time, the Lenders will confirm in writing the Administrative
Agent’s authority to release or subordinate its interest in particular types or items of property, or to release any Guarantor
from its obligations under the Credit Documents, pursuant to this Section 9.10(b).
 

 111
 

 
9.11         Rate
Management Agreements and Cash Management Agreements. Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein, no Rate Management
Party or Cash Management Bank that obtains the benefit of the provisions of Section 2.10(e), the Guaranty or any
Collateral by virtue of the provisions hereof or any Security Document shall have any right to notice of any action or to
consent to, direct or object to any action hereunder or under any other Credit Document or otherwise in respect of the
Collateral (including the release or impairment of any Collateral) (or to notice of or to consent to any amendment, waiver or
modification of the provisions hereof or of the Guaranty or any Security Document) other than in its capacity as a Lender
and, in such case, only to the extent expressly provided in the Credit Documents. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article
IX to the contrary, the Administrative Agent shall not be required to verify the payment of, or that other satisfactory
arrangements have been made with respect to, Obligations arising under any Cash Management Agreements and Rate Management
Agreements except to the extent expressly provided herein and unless the Administrative Agent has received written notice of
such Obligations, together with such supporting documentation as the Administrative Agent may request, from the applicable
Cash Management Bank or Rate Management Party (other than the Administrative Agent or any Affiliate thereof), as the case may
be. The Administrative Agent shall not be required to verify the payment of, or that other satisfactory arrangements have
been made with respect to, Obligations arising under Cash Management Agreements and Rate Management Agreements in the case of
the termination of the Commitments and payment of the Obligations in full (other than contingent indemnification obligations
and Obligations arising under Cash Management Agreements and Rate Management Agreements).

proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory, whether brought by a third
party or by the Borrower or any other Credit Party, and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto; provided
that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages,
liabilities or related expenses (x) are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable
judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee or (y) result from a claim
brought by the Borrower or any other Credit Party against an Indemnitee for breach in bad faith of such Indemnitee’s
obligations hereunder or under any other Credit Document, if the Borrower or such Credit Party has obtained a final and
nonappealable judgment in its favor on such claim as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. This Section
10.1(b) shall not apply with respect to Taxes other than any Taxes that represent losses, claims, damages or related
liabilities or expenses arising from any non-Tax claim.
 
(c)              To the extent
that the Borrower for any reason fails to indefeasibly pay any amount required under Section 10.1(a) or 10.1(b) to
be paid by it to the Administrative Agent (or any sub-agent thereof), the L/C Issuer or any Related Party of any of the foregoing,
each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent), the L/C Issuer or such Related Party,
as the case may be, such Lender’s proportion (based on the percentages as used in determining the Required Lenders as of
the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount (including any such unpaid
amount in respect of a claim asserted by such Lender); provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim,
damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent (or any
such sub-agent), against the L/C Issuer in its capacity as such, or against any Related Party of any of the foregoing acting for
the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent) or the L/C Issuer in connection with such capacity. The obligations of the Lenders
under this Section 10.1(c) are subject to the provisions of Section 2.3(c).
 
(d)             
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Parent, the Borrower, each other Credit Party and each Related Party
of any of the foregoing Persons shall not assert, and each hereby waives, any claim against the Parent, the Borrower, each
other Credit Party and each Related Party or any Indemnitee, as applicable, on any theory of liability, for special,
indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or
as a result of, this Agreement, any other Credit Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof. No Indemnitee
referred to in Section 10.1(b) shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by unintended recipients of any
information or other materials distributed by it through telecommunications, electronic or other information transmission
systems (including the Platform, Intralinks, SyndTrak or similar systems) in connection with this Agreement or the other
Credit Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.
 

 113
 

 
(e)              All amounts
due under this Section 10.1 shall be payable by the Borrower upon five Business Days after demand therefor.
 
(f)              The agreements
in this Section and the indemnity provisions of Section 10.4(e) shall survive the resignation of the Administrative Agent and the
L/C Issuer, the replacement of any Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all
the other Obligations.
 
10.2         Governing Law;
Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Venue; Service of Process.
 
(a)              This Agreement

as expressly set forth therein) shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the law of the State of New York.
 
(b)            
The Borrower irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that it will not commence any action, litigation or proceeding of any kind

relating hereto or thereto, in any forum other than the courts of the State of New York sitting in New York County, and of the
United States District Court of the Southern District of New York, and any appellate court from any thereof, and each of the parties
hereto irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the jurisdiction of such courts and agrees that all claims in respect of any
such action, litigation or proceeding may be heard and determined in such state court or, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
law, in such federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action, litigation or proceeding
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.
Nothing in this Agreement or in any other Credit Document shall affect any right that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may
otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Credit Document against the Borrower or
any other Credit Party or its properties in the courts of any jurisdiction.
 
(c)              The Borrower
irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any objection that it may now or hereafter
have to the laying of venue of any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other Credit Document
in any court referred to in Section 10.2(b). Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.
 

 114
 

 
(d)       
Each party hereto irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 10.4. Nothing
in this Agreement will affect the right of any party hereto to serve process in any other manner permitted by applicable law.
 
10.3      Waiver of Jury
Trial. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE
TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR IND

R THEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO
(A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PERSON HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH
OTHER PERSON WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES
THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENTS BY, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

service, mailed by certified or registered mail or sent by facsimile or e-mail transmission as follows:
 
(i)             if
to the Borrower or any other Credit Party, the Administrative Agent or the L/C Issuer, to it at the address, facsimile number or
e-mail address specified for such Person on Schedule 1.1(a); and
 
(ii)

115
 


 
(b)          
Notices and other communications to the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuer hereunder may be delivered or
furnished by electronic communication including e-mail or by posting such notices or communications on internet or intranet
websites such as SyndTrak or a substantially similar electronic transmission system (the “Platform”)
pursuant to procedures approved by the Administrative Agent; provided that the foregoing shall not apply to notices to
any Lender or the L/C Issuer pursuant to Article II if such Lender or the L/C Issuer has notified the Administrative
Agent that it is incapable of receiving notices under such Article by electronic communication. The Administrative Agent, the
L/C Issuer or the Borrower may each, in its discretion, agree to accept notices and other communications to it hereunder by
electronic communication pursuant to procedures approved by it; provided that approval of such procedures may be
limited to particular notices or communications. Unless the Administrative Agent otherwise prescribes, (i) notices and other

the intended recipient (such as by the “return receipt requested” function, as available, return e-mail or other
written acknowledgement), and (ii) notices or other communications posted to an internet or intranet website shall be deemed
received upon the deemed receipt by the intended recipient at its e-mail address as described in the foregoing clause (i) of
notification that such notice or communication is available and identifying the website address therefor; provided
that, for both clauses (i) and (ii) above, if such notice or other communication is not sent during the normal business hours

(c)            THE PLATFORM
IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” The Agent Parties do not warrant the adequacy of the Platform and
expressly disclaim liability for errors or omissions in the communications effected thereby. No warranty of any kind, express,
implied or statutory, including any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement of third-party
rights or freedom from viruses or other code defects, is made by any Agent Party in connection with any such communications or
the Platform. In no event shall the Administrative Agent or any of its Related Parties (collectively, the “Agent Parties”)
have any liability to any Credit Party, any Lender or any other Person or entity for damages of any kind, including direct or indirect,
special, incidental or consequential damages, losses or expenses (whether in tort, contract or otherwise), arising out of any Credit
Party’s or the Administrative Agent’s transmission of any notices or communications through the Platform, any other
electronic platform or electronic messaging service, or through the Internet, other than for direct or actual damages resulting
from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Agent Party as determined by a final and nonappealable judgment of a court
of competent jurisdiction.
 
(d)          
Any party hereto may change its address, facsimile number or e-mail address for notices and other communications hereunder by notice
to the other parties hereto (except that each Lender need not give notice of any such change to the other Lenders in their capacities
as such). In addition, each Lender agrees to notify the Administrative Agent from time to time to ensure that the Administrative
Agent has on record (i) an effective address, contact name, telephone number, fax number and e-mail address to which notices and
other communications may be sent and (ii) accurate wire instructions for such Lender.

Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and the Lenders shall be entitled to rely and act upon any notices (including, without
limitation, telephonic or electronic notices, Notices of Borrowing and Applications) purportedly given by or on behalf of any
Credit Party even if (i) such notices were not made in a manner specified herein, were incomplete or were not preceded or
followed by any other form of notice specified herein, or (ii) the terms thereof, as understood by the recipient, varied from
any confirmation thereof. The Credit Parties shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer, each Lender and the
Related Parties of each of them from all losses, costs, expenses and liabilities resulting from the reliance by such Person
on each notice purportedly given by or on behalf of a Credit Party. All telephonic notices to and other telephonic
communications with the Administrative Agent may be recorded by the Administrative Agent, and each of the parties hereto
hereby consents to such recording.
 


116
 

 
10.5      Amendments,
Waivers, etc. No amendment, modification, waiver or discharge or termination of, or consent to any departure by any Credit
Party from, any provision of this Agreement or any other Credit Document shall be effective unless in a writing signed by the
Required Lenders (or by the Administrative Agent at the direction or with the consent of the Required Lenders), and then the same
shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given; provided, however,
that no such amendment, modification, waiver, discharge, termination or consent shall:
 
(a)            unless agreed
to in writing by each Lender directly affected thereby, (i) reduce or forgive the principal amount of any Loan or funded Letter
of Credit participation, reduce the rate of or forgive any interest thereon (provided that only the consent of the Required
Lenders shall be required to waive the applicability of any post-default increase in interest rates), or reduce or forgive any
fees hereunder (other than fees payable to the Administrative Agent or the Arranger for its own account), (ii) extend the final
scheduled maturity date or any other scheduled date for the payment of any principal of or interest on any Loan or funded Letter
of Credit participation (including any scheduled date for the mandatory reduction or termination of any Commitments, but excluding
any mandatory prepayment of the Loans pursuant to Section 2.6(d) or 2.6(e) or reduction or termination of the Commitments
in connection therewith), or extend the time of payment of any fees hereunder (other than fees payable to the Administrative Agent
or the Arranger for its own account), or (iii) increase any Commitment of any such Lender over the amount thereof in effect or
extend the maturity thereof (it being understood that a waiver of any condition precedent set forth in Section 3.2 or of
any Default or Event of Default or mandatory reduction in the Commitments, if agreed to by the Required Lenders or all Lenders
(as may be required hereunder with respect to such waiver), shall not constitute such an increase), or (iv) reduce the percentage
of the aggregate Commitments or of the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Loans, or the number or percentage of Lenders,
that shall be required for the Lenders or any of them to take or approve, or direct the Administrative Agent to take, any action
hereunder or under any other Credit Document (including as set forth in the definition of “Required Lenders”);
 
(b)          
unless agreed to in writing by all of the Lenders, (i) release all or substantially all of the Collateral (except as may be otherwise
specifically provided in this Agreement or in any other Credit Document), (ii) release any Guarantor from its obligations under
the Guaranty (other than (A) as may be otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement or in any other Credit Document or (B)
in connection with the sale or other disposition of all of the Capital Stock of such Guarantor in a transaction expressly permitted
under or pursuant to this Agreement), (iii) change any other provision of this Agreement or any of the other Credit Documents requiring,
by its terms, the consent or approval of all the Lenders for such amendment, modification, waiver, discharge, termination or consent,
(iv) change or waive any provision of Section 2.13, any other provision of this Agreement or any other Credit Document requiring
pro rata treatment of any Lenders in a manner that would alter the pro rata treatment required thereby, or (vi) amend this Section
10.5;
 
(c)            [reserved];
 


117
 

 
(d)           [reserved];
 
(e)            unless agreed
to in writing by the L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent in addition to the Lenders required as provided hereinabove to take
such action, affect the respective rights or obligations of the L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, hereunder
or under any of the other Credit Documents; and
 
(f)            unless agreed
to in writing by each Rate Management Party and Cash Management Bank that would be adversely affected thereby in its capacity as
such relative to the Lenders, (i) amend the definition of “Secured Obligations” in any Security Document or the definition
of “Guaranteed Obligations” in the Guaranty (or any similar defined term in any other Credit Document benefiting such
Rate Management Party), (ii) amend the definition of “Secured Parties” in any Security Document or “Guaranteed
Parties” in the Guaranty (or any similar defined term in any other Credit Document benefiting such Rate Management Party),
or (iii) amend any provision regarding priority of payments in this Agreement or any other Credit Document;
 
and provided further
that (i) if any amendment, modification, waiver or consent would adversely affect the holders of Loans of a particular Class (the
“Affected Class”) relative to holders of Loans of another Class (including by way of reducing the relative
proportion of any payments, prepayments or Commitment reductions to be applied for the benefit of holders of Loans of the Affected
Class under Section 2.6(d) or 2.6(e)), then such amendment, modification, waiver or consent shall require the written
consent of Lenders holding at least a majority of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all Loans (and unutilized Commitments,
if any) of the Affected Class, (ii) the Fee Letter may be amended or modified, and any rights thereunder waived, in a writing
signed only by the parties thereto, (iii) any Incremental Amendment need be executed only by the Borrower, the other Credit Parties,
the Administrative Agent and each Person that agrees to provide an Incremental Commitment with respect to the Incremental Increase
implemented thereby.
 
Notwithstanding the fact that the
consent of all Lenders is required in certain circumstances as set forth above, each Lender is entitled to vote as such
Lender sees fit on any bankruptcy reorganization plan that affects the Loans, and each Lender acknowledges that the
provisions of Section 1126(c) of the Bankruptcy Code supersedes the unanimous consent provisions set forth herein.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) no Defaulting Lender shall have any right to approve or disapprove any
amendment, waiver or consent hereunder (and any amendment, waiver or consent which by its terms requires the consent of all
Lenders or each affected Lender may be effected with the consent of the applicable Lenders other than Defaulting Lenders),
except that (x) no Commitment or Loan of any Defaulting Lender may be increased or extended without the consent of such
Lender and (y) any waiver, amendment or modification requiring the consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender that by its
terms affects any Defaulting Lender disproportionately adversely relative to other affected Lenders shall require the consent
of such Defaulting Lender and (ii) if the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall have jointly identified (each in its
sole discretion) an obvious error or omission of a technical or immaterial nature, or any ambiguity, mistake, defect or
inconsistency, in each case, in any provision of the Credit Documents, then the Administrative Agent and the applicable Loan
Parties shall be permitted to amend such provision and such amendment shall become effective without any further action or
consent of any other party to any Credit Document if the same is not objected to in writing by the Required Lenders within
five Business Days following the posting of such amendment to the Lenders.
 


118
 

 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement or any other Credit Document, (a) any Lender may exchange, continue or rollover all or the portion of its Loans
in connection with any refinancing, extension, loan modification or similar transaction permitted by the terms of this Agreement,
pursuant to a cashless settlement mechanism approved by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and such Lender, (b) this Agreement
may be amended and restated without the consent of any Lender (but with the consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent)
if, upon giving effect to such amendment and restatement, such Lender shall no longer be a party to this Agreement (as so amended
and restated), the Commitments of such Lender shall have terminated, such Lender shall have no other commitment or other obligation
hereunder and shall have been paid in full all principal, interest and other amounts owing to it or accrued for its account under
this Agreement, and (c) the Administrative Agent may amend or modify this Agreement and any other Credit Document to grant a new
Lien for the benefit of the holders of the Obligations, extend an existing Lien over additional property for the benefit of the
holders of the Obligations or join additional Persons as Credit Parties.
 
10.6      Successors
and Assigns.
 
(a)            The provisions
of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns
permitted hereby, except that neither the Borrower nor any other Credit Party may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights
or obligations hereunder or under any other Credit Document without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and each
Lender and no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder except (i) to an Eligible Assignee
in accordance with the provisions of Section 10.6(b), (ii) by way of participation in accordance with the provisions of
Section 10.6(e) or (iii) by way of pledge or assignment of a security interest subject to the restrictions of Section
10.6(f) (and any other attempted assignment or transfer by any party hereto shall be null and void). Nothing in this Agreement,
expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors
and assigns permitted hereby, Participants to the extent provided in Section 10.6(e) and, to the extent expressly contemplated
hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim
under or by reason of this Agreement.
 
(b)          
Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement
(including all or a portion of its Commitments and the Loans (including for purposes of this Section 10.6(b), participations
in Letters of Credit) at the time owing to it); provided that any such assignment shall be subject to the following conditions:
 
(i)             (A)
in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender’s Commitment and/or the Loans at
the time owing to it or in the case of an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund, no minimum
amount need be assigned, or (B) in any case not described in clause (A) above, the aggregate amount of the Commitment (which
for this purpose includes Loans outstanding thereunder) or, if the applicable Commitment is not then in effect, the principal
outstanding balance of the Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the
Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if “Trade
Date” is specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade Date) shall not be less than (x) $5,000,000, in
the case of any assignment in respect of an unexpired Commitment (which for this purpose includes Committed Loans
outstanding) or (y) $1,000,000, in the case of any assignment in respect of the Converted Term Loan, in any case, treating
contemporaneous assignments related Approved Funds under common management as one assignment for purposes of the minimum
amounts, unless each of the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, the Borrower otherwise consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed);
 


119
 

 
(ii)           each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations
under this Agreement with respect to the Loan or the Commitment assigned, except that this Section 10.6(b)(ii) shall not
prohibit any Lender from assigning all or a portion of its rights and obligations among separate Classes of Loans and/or Commitments
on a non-pro rata basis;
 
(iii)          no consent shall be required for any assignment except to the extent required by clause (B) of Section 10.6(b)(i) and, in
addition:
 
(A)       the
consent of the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required unless (1) an Event of Default
has occurred and is continuing at the time of such assignment or (2) such assignment is to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or
an Approved Fund; provided that the Borrower shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment unless it shall object
thereto by written notice to the Administrative Agent within five (5) Business Days after having received notice thereof;
 
(B)       the
consent of the Administrative Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required for assignments
to a Person who is not a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund; and
 
(C)       the
consent of the L/C Issuer (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required for any assignment in respect
of a Commitment or participation in any L/C Obligation;
 
(iv)         
the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with
a processing and recordation fee of $3,500 for each assignment and the assignee, if it is not a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative
Agent an Administrative Questionnaire; provided that in the case of an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender
or an Approved Fund, no such fee shall be required;
 
(v)       
   no such assignment shall be made to (A) the Parent, the Borrower or any of their respective Affiliates or Subsidiaries or (B) to
any Defaulting Lender or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Person who, upon becoming a Lender hereunder, would constitute a Defaulting
Lender or Subsidiary thereof; and
 


120
 

 
(vi)         
no such assignment shall be made to a natural Person (or a holding company, investment vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated
for the primary benefit of, a natural Person).
 
Subject to acceptance and recording thereof
by the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 10.6(c), from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment
and Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such
Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder
shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement
(and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this
Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.14(a),
2.14(b), 2.15, 2.16 and 10.1 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective
date of such assignment; provided that, except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no assignment
by a Defaulting Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from such Lender’s
having been a Defaulting Lender. If requested by or on behalf of the assignee, the Borrower, at its own expense, will execute and
deliver to the Administrative Agent a new Note to the order of the assignee (and, if the assigning Lender has retained any portion
of its rights and obligations hereunder, to the order of the assigning Lender). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights
or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 10.6(b) shall be treated for purposes of this
Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with Section 10.6(e).
 
(c)            In connection
with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless
and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional
payments to the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be
outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding,
with the consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Loans previously requested but
not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x)
pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer
or any Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon), and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro rata share of all
Loans and participations in Letters of Credit in accordance with its Applicable Percentage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under applicable
law without compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting
Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs.
 


121
 

 
(d)          
The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower (and such agency being
solely for tax purposes), shall maintain at its address for notices referred to in Schedule 1.1(a) a copy of each
Assignment and Assumption delivered to it (or the equivalent thereof in electronic form) and a register for the recordation
of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts (and stated interest) of the Loans
and L/C Obligations owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the “Register”).
The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for
all purposes of this Agreement. In addition, the Administrative Agent shall maintain on the Register information regarding
the designation, revocation of designation, of any Lender as a Defaulting Lender. The Register shall be available for
inspection by the Borrower at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. In addition, at any
time that a request for a consent for a material or substantive change to the Credit Documents is pending, any Lender wishing
to consult with other Lenders in connection therewith may request and receive from the Administrative Agent a copy of the
Register.
 
(e)            Any
Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations
to any Person (other than a natural Person, or a holding company, investment vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated for
the primary benefit of, a natural Person, or the Borrower or any of the Borrower’s Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a
“Participant”) in all or a portion of such Lender’s rights and/or obligations under this Agreement
(including all or a portion of its Commitments and/or the Loans (including such Lender’s participations in Letters of
Credit) owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged,
(ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and
(iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuer shall continue to deal solely and directly with
such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument
pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce
this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that
such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any
amendment, waiver or other modification described in Section 10.5(a) and clause (i) of Section 10.5(b) that
affects such Participant. The Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections
2.14(a), 2.14(b), 2.15 and 2.16 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its
interest by assignment pursuant to Section 10.6(b); provided that such Participant (A) agrees to be subject to
the provisions of Section 2.17 as if it were an assignee under Section 10.6(b) and (B) shall not be entitled to
receive any greater payment under Section 2.14 or 2.15, with respect to any participation, than its
participating Lender would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment
results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation. Each Lender that sells
a participation agrees, at the Borrower’s request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrower
to effectuate the provisions of Section 2.17 with respect to any Participant. To the extent permitted by law, each
Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 8.3 as though it were a Lender; provided that
such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.13(b) as though it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a
participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it
enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant’s
interest in the Loans or other Obligations under the Credit Documents (the “Participant Register”); provided
that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity
of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant’s interest in any Commitments, Loans or its other
obligations under any Credit Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish such
Commitment, Loan or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury
Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat
each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no
responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.
 


122
 

 
(f)            Any Lender may
at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including under its
Notes, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve
Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute
any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.
 
(g)          
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if at any time Fifth Third assigns all of its Commitment and Loans pursuant
to Section 10.6(b), Fifth Third may, upon thirty (30) days’ notice to the Borrower and the Lenders, resign as L/C
Issuer. In the event of any such resignation as L/C Issuer, the Borrower shall be entitled to appoint from among the Lenders a
successor L/C Issuer or hereunder; provided, however, that no failure by the Borrower to appoint any such successor shall
affect the resignation of Fifth Third as L/C Issuer. If Fifth Third resigns as L/C Issuer, it shall retain all the rights, powers,
privileges and duties of the L/C Issuer hereunder with respect to all Letters of Credit outstanding as of the effective date of
its resignation as L/C Issuer and all L/C Obligations with respect thereto (including the right to require the Lenders to make
Loans or fund risk participations therein pursuant to Section 2.21). Upon the appointment of a successor L/C Issuer, (i)
such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring L/C Issuer
or and (ii) the successor L/C Issuer shall issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding
at the time of such succession or make other arrangements satisfactory to Fifth Third to effectively assume the obligations of
Fifth Third with respect to such Letters of Credit.
 
(h)          


Electronic Signatures
in Global and National Commerce Act, New York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act, or any state laws based on the Uniform
Electronic Transactions Act.
 
(i)             Any
Lender or participant may, in connection with any assignment, participation, pledge or proposed assignment, participation or pledge
pursuant to this Section 10.6, disclose to the assignee, Participant or pledgee or proposed assignee, Participant or pledgee
any information relating to the Company Parties furnished to it by or on behalf of any other party hereto; provided that
such assignee, Participant or pledgee or proposed assignee, Participant or pledgee agrees in writing to keep such information confidential
to the same extent required of the Lenders under Section 10.11 (which may be pursuant to customary “click-through”
or other customary assignment or syndication processes via the Platform or otherwise).
 


123
 

 
10.7      No Waiver;
Enforcement. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and the Lenders expressly set forth in this
Agreement and the other Credit Documents are cumulative and in addition to, and not exclusive of, all other rights and remedies
available at law, in equity or otherwise. No failure or delay on the part of the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or any Lender
in exercising any right, power or privilege shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any
such right, power or privilege preclude other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege
or be construed to be a waiver of any Default or Event of Default. No course of dealing between any Credit Party, the Administrative
Agent, the L/C Issuer or the Lenders or their agents or employees shall be effective to amend, modify or discharge any provision
of this Agreement or any other Credit Document or to constitute a waiver of any Default or Event of Default. No notice to or demand
upon any Credit Party in any case shall entitle any Credit Party to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances
or constitute a waiver of the right of the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or any Lender to exercise any right or remedy or
take any other or further action in any circumstances without notice or demand.
 
Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein or in any other Credit Document, the authority to enforce rights and remedies
hereunder and under the other Credit Documents against the Credit Parties or any of them shall be vested exclusively in, and
all actions and proceedings at law in connection with such enforcement shall be instituted and maintained exclusively by, the
Administrative Agent in accordance with Section 8.2 for the benefit of all the Lenders and the L/C Issuer; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not prohibit (a) the Administrative Agent from exercising on its own behalf the rights
and remedies that inure to its benefit (solely in its capacity as Administrative Agent) hereunder and under the other Credit
Documents, (b) the L/C Issuer from exercising the rights and remedies that inure to its benefit (solely in its capacity as
L/C Issuer) hereunder and under the other Credit Documents, (c) any Lender from exercising setoff rights in accordance with Section
8.3 (subject to the terms of Section 2.13(b)), or (d) any Lender from filing proofs of claim or appearing and
filing pleadings on its own behalf during the pendency of a proceeding relative to any Credit Party under any Debtor Relief
Law; and provided, further, that if at any time there is no Person acting as Administrative Agent hereunder and under
the other Credit Documents, then (i) the Required Lenders shall have the rights otherwise ascribed to the Administrative
Agent pursuant to Section 8.2 and (ii) in addition to the matters set forth in clauses (b), (c) and (d) of the
preceding proviso and subject to Section 2.13(b), any Lender may, with the consent of the Required Lenders, enforce
any rights and remedies available to it and as authorized by the Required Lenders.
 
10.8       Survival.
All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by or on behalf of the Borrower or any other Company Party in
this Agreement and in the other Credit Documents and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with
or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Credit Document shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other
parties hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the making of any Loans or L/C Credit
Extensions, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the
Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or Event of Default or
incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and
effect as long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan, any L/C Obligation or any fee or any other amount
payable under this Agreement is outstanding and unpaid and so long as the Commitments have not expired or terminated. In
addition, notwithstanding anything herein or under applicable law to the contrary, the provisions of this Agreement and the
other Credit Documents relating to indemnification or payment of costs and expenses, including the provisions of Sections
2.14(a), 2.14(b), 2.15, 2.16 and 10.1, shall survive the payment in full of all Loans and L/C Obligations,
the termination of the Commitments and all Letters of Credit, and any termination of this Agreement or any of the other
Credit Documents.
 


124
 

 
10.9       Severability.
To the extent any provision of this Agreement or any other Credit Document is prohibited by or invalid, illegal or unenforceable
under the applicable law of any jurisdiction, such provision shall be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition, invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability and only in such jurisdiction, without prohibiting or invalidating such provision in any other jurisdiction
or the remaining provisions of this Agreement in any jurisdiction. Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this Section
10.9, if and to the extent that the enforceability of any provisions in this Agreement relating to Defaulting Lenders shall
be limited by Debtor Relief Laws, as determined in good faith by the Administrative Agent or the L/C Issuer, as applicable, then
such provisions shall be deemed to be in effect only to the extent not so limited.
 
10.10     Construction.
The headings of the various articles, sections and subsections of this Agreement and the table of contents have been inserted for
convenience only and shall not in any way affect the meaning or construction of any of the provisions hereof. Except as otherwise
expressly provided herein and in the other Credit Documents, in the event of any inconsistency or conflict between any provision
of this Agreement and any provision of any of the other Credit Documents, the provision of this Agreement shall control. Any Rate
Management Agreement between the Borrower and any Rate Management Party is an independent agreement governed by the writing provisions
of such Rate Management Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect, unaffected by any repayment, prepayment, acceleration,
reduction, increase or change in the terms applicable to the Loans under this Agreement, except as otherwise expressly provided
in such Rate Management Agreement, and any payoff statement from the Administrative Agent relating to this Agreement shall not
apply to such Rate Management Agreement except as expressly provided therein. Any Cash Management Agreement between the Borrower
and any Cash Management Bank is an independent agreement governed by the written provisions of such Cash Management Agreement,
which shall remain in full force and effect, unaffected by any repayment, prepayment, acceleration, reduction, increase or change
in the terms applicable to the Loans under this Agreement, except as otherwise expressly provided in such Cash Management Agreement,
and any payoff statement from the Administrative Agent relating to this Agreement shall not apply to such Cash Management Agreement
except as expressly provided therein.
 


125
 

 
10.11     Confidentiality.
Each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined
below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its Affiliates and to its Related Parties (it being understood that
the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to
keep such Information confidential); (b) to the extent required or requested by any regulatory authority purporting to have
jurisdiction over such Person or its Related Parties (including any self-regulatory authority, such as the National
Association of Insurance Commissioners); (c) to the extent required by applicable Requirements of Law or by any subpoena or
similar legal process; (d) to any other party hereto; (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or under
any other Credit Document or any Rate Management Agreement or any Cash Management Agreement or any action or proceeding
relating to this Agreement or any other Credit Document or any Rate Management Agreement or any Cash Management Agreement or
the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder; (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same
as those of this Section 10.11 (including pursuant to any customary “click-through” or other customary
assignment or syndication processes of the Administrative Agent or the Lender via the Platform or otherwise), to (i) any
assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights and obligations under this
Agreement or (ii) any actual or prospective party (or its Related Parties) to any swap, derivative or other transaction under
which payments are to be made by reference to the Borrower and its obligations, this Agreement or payments hereunder; (g) on
a confidential basis to (i) any rating agency in connection with the Borrower or its Subsidiaries or the facilities created
hereunder or (ii) the CUSIP Service Bureau or any similar agency in connection with the issuance monitoring of CUSIP numbers
with respect to the facilities created hereunder; (h) with the consent of the Borrower; or (i) to the extent such Information
(x) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section 10.11 or (y) becomes available to
the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any of their respective Affiliates on a nonconfidential basis from a source other
than the Borrower.
 
For purposes of this
Section 10.11, “Information” means all information received from the Company Parties relating to any
Company Party or any of their respective businesses, other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent
or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by any Company Party; provided that, in the case of information
received from any Company Party after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential.
Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section 10.11 shall be considered
to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality
of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information.
 
10.12     Counterparts;
Integration; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto in different counterparts),
each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement
and the other Credit Documents constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede
any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. Except as provided
in Section 3.1, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when
the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof that, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the
other parties hereto. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement or any other Credit Document by
facsimile or in electronic format (e.g., “pdf” or “tif” file format) shall be effective as delivery of
a manually executed counterpart of such signature page.
 
10.13     Disclosure
of Information. The Borrower agrees and consents to the Administrative Agent’s and the Arranger’s disclosure of
information relating to this transaction to Gold Sheets and other similar bank trade publications. Such information will
consist of deal terms and other information customarily found in such publications.
 


126
 

 
10.14     USA Patriot
Act Notice. Each Lender that is subject to the PATRIOT Act and the Administrative Agent (for itself and not on behalf of any
Lender) hereby notifies the Borrower and the other Credit Parties that pursuant to the requirements of the PATRIOT Act, it is required
to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each Credit Party, which information includes the name and address of
each Credit Party and other information that will allow such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, to identify each
Credit Party in accordance with the PATRIOT Act. The Borrower and the other Credit Parties shall, promptly following a request
by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, provide all such other documentation and information that the Administrative Agent or
such Lender requests in order to comply with its ongoing obligations under applicable “know your customer” and anti-money
laundering rules and regulations, including the PATRIOT Act.
 
10.15     Termination
of Obligations of the Parent or Intermediate Holdco. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement or any Credit Document,
provided that no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, all obligations of the non-surviving Person in the Parent Roll
Up shall automatically terminate and such non-surviving Person shall be released from its obligations under the Guaranty on the
date of the Parent Roll Up. From and after such date, (i) the non-surviving Person in any Parent Roll Up shall have no further
obligations as Guarantor, Credit Party, Company Party or the Parent or Intermediate Holdco, as the case may be, under this Agreement
or any Credit Document, (ii) the Surviving Parent shall be obligated as a Guarantor and shall have granted to the Administrative
Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders, a lien on and security interest in 100% of the outstanding Capital Stock of the Borrower
and (iii) each reference herein or in any other Credit Document to the “Parent” or “Intermediate Holdco”
shall be a reference to the Surviving Parent.
 
10.16     Acknowledgment
and Consent to Bail-In of EEA Financial Institutions. Solely to the extent any Lender or L/C Issuer that is an EEA Financial
Institution is a party to this Agreement and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Credit Document or in any other agreement,
arrangement or understanding among any such parties, each party hereto acknowledges that any liability of any Lender or L/C Issuer
that is an EEA Financial Institution arising under any Credit Document, to the extent such liability is unsecured, may be subject
to the write-down and conversion powers of an EEA Resolution Authority and agrees and consents to, and acknowledges and agrees
to be bound by:
 
(a)           the application
of any Write-Down and Conversion Powers by an EEA Resolution Authority to any such liabilities arising hereunder which may be payable
to it by any Lender or L/C Issuer that is an EEA Financial Institution; and
 
(b)         
 the effects of any Bail-In Action on any such liability, including, if applicable:
 
(i)            a reduction in
full or in part or c

ut, in each case, only up to the maximum amount of such liability that can be hereby
incurred without rendering such Qualified ECP Guarantor’s obligations and undertakings under this Section voidable under
applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer, and not for any greater amount). The obligations and undertakings
of each Qualified ECP Guarantor under this Section shall remain in full force and effect until the Obligations have been indefeasibly
paid and performed in full. Each Credit Party intends this Section to constitute, and this Section shall be deemed to constitute,
a guarantee of the obligations of, and a “keepwell, support, or other agreement” for the benefit of, each Specified
Guarantor for all purposes of the Commodity Exchange Act.

respect of any Accounts, Contracts or other Collateral shall be received in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent
hereunder, shall be segregated from the other funds of such Pledgor and shall be forthwith deposited into such account or paid
over or delivered to the Administrative Agent in the same form as so received (with any necessary endorsements or assignments),
to be held as Collateral and applied to the Secured Obligations as provided herein; and by this provision, each Pledgor irrevocably
authorizes and directs each Person who is or shall be a party to or liable for the performance of any Contract, upon receipt of
notice from the Administrative Agent to the effect that an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, to attorn to or otherwise
recognize the Administrative Agent as owner under such Contract and to pay, observe and otherwise perform the obligations under
such Contract to or for the Administrative Agent or the Administrative Agent’s designee as though the Administrative Agent
or such designee were such Pledgor named therein, and to do so until otherwise notified by the Administrative Agent;
 
(b)           To
take possession of, receive, endorse, assign and deliver, in its own name or in the name of any Pledgor, all checks, notes,
drafts and other Instruments relating to any Collateral, including receiving, opening and properly disposing of all mail
addressed to any Pledgor concerning Accounts and other Collateral; to verify with account debtors or other contract parties
the validity, amount or any other matter relating to any Accounts or other Collateral, in its own name or in the name of any
Pledgor; to accelerate any Indebtedness or other obligation constituting Collateral that may be accelerated in accordance
with its terms; to take or bring all actions and suits deemed necessary or appropriate to effect collections and to enforce
payment of any Accounts or other Collateral; to settle, compromise or release in whole or in part any amounts owing on
Accounts or other Collateral; and to extend the time of payment of any and all Accounts or other amounts owing under any
Collateral and to make allowances and adjustments with respect thereto, all in the same manner and to the same extent as any
Pledgor might have done;
 
(c)           To notify any or all depository institutions
with which any Deposit Accounts are maintained and which Deposit Accounts are subject to control in favor of the Administrative
Agent to remit and transfer all monies, securities and other property on deposit in such Deposit Accounts or deposited or received
for deposit thereafter to the Administrative Agent, for deposit in a Collateral Account or such other accounts as may be designated
by the Administrative Agent, for application to the Secured Obligations as provided herein;
 
(d)           To
transfer to or register in its name or the name of any of its Administrative Agents or nominees all or any part of the Collateral,
without notice to any Pledgor and with or without disclosing that such Collateral is subject to the security interest created hereunder;
 
(e)           To require any Pledgor to, and each
Pledgor hereby agrees that it will at its expense and upon request of the Administrative Agent forthwith, assemble all or any part
of the Collateral as directed by the Administrative Agent and make it available to the Administrative Agent at a place designated
by the Administrative Agent;
 
(f)            To
enter and remain upon the premises of any Pledgor and take possession of all or any part of the Collateral, with or without judicial
process; to use the materials, services, books and records of any Pledgor for the purpose of liquidating or collecting the Collateral,
whether by foreclosure, auction or otherwise; and to remove the same to the premises of the Administrative Agent or any designated
agent for such time as the Administrative Agent may desire, in order to effectively collect or liquidate the Collateral;
 


15 
 

 
(g)           To
exercise (i) all voting, consensual and other rights and powers pertaining to the Pledged Interests (whether or not transferred
into the name of the Administrative Agent), at any meeting of shareholders, partners, members or otherwise, and (ii) any and all
rights of conversion, exchange, subscription and any other rights, privileges or options pertaining to the Pledged Interests as
if it were the absolute owner thereof (including the right to exchange at its discretion any and all of the Pledged Interests
upon the merger, consolidation, reorganization, reclassification, combination of shares or interests, similar rearrangement or
other similar fundamental change in the structure of the applicable issuer, or upon the exercise by any Pledgor or the Administrative
Agent of any right, privilege or option pertaining to such Pledged Interests), and in connection therewith, the right to deposit
and deliver any and all of the Pledged Interests with any committee, depositary, transfer agent, registrar or other designated
agency upon such terms and conditions as the Administrative Agent may determine, and give all consents, waivers and ratifications
in respect of the Pledged Interests, all without liability except to account for any property actually received by it, but the
Administrative Agent shall have no duty to exercise any such right, privilege or option or give any such consent, waiver or ratification
and shall not be responsible for any failure to do so or delay in so doing; and for the foregoing purposes each Pledgor will promptly
execute and deliver or cause to be executed and delivered to the Administrative Agent, upon request, all such proxies and other
instruments as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request to enable the Administrative Agent to exercise such rights and
powers; AND IN FURTHERANCE OF THE FOREGOING AND WITHOUT LIMITATION THEREOF, EACH PLEDGOR HEREBY IRREVOCABLY CONSTITUTES AND APPOINTS
THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AS THE TRUE AND LAWFUL PROXY AND ATTORNEY-IN-FACT OF SUCH PLEDGOR, WITH FULL POWER OF SUBSTITUTION IN
THE PREMISES, TO EXERCISE ALL SUCH VOTING, CONSENSUAL AND OTHER RIGHTS AND POWERS TO WHICH ANY HOLDER OF ANY PLEDGED INTERESTS
WOULD BE ENTITLED BY VIRTUE OF HOLDING THE SAME, WHICH PROXY AND POWER OF ATTORNEY, BEING COUPLED WITH AN INTEREST, IS IRREVOCABLE
AND SHALL BE EFFECTIVE FOR SO LONG AS THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE IN EFFECT; and
 
(h)          
To sell, resell, assign and deliver, in its sole discretion, all or any of the Collateral, in one or more parcels, on any securities
exchange on which any Pledged Interests may be listed, at public or private sale, at any of the Administrative Agent’s offices
or elsewhere, for cash, upon credit or for future delivery, at such time or times and at such price or prices and upon such other
terms as the Administrative Agent may deem satisfactory. If any of the Collateral is sold by the Administrative Agent upon credit
or for future delivery, the Administrative Agent shall not be liable for the failure of the purchaser to purchase or pay for the
same and, in the event of any such failure, the Administrative Agent may resell such Collateral. In no event shall any Pledgor
be credited with any part of the Proceeds of sale of any Collateral until and to the extent cash payment in respect thereof has
actually been received by the Administrative Agent. Each purchaser at any such sale shall hold the property sold absolutely, free
from any claim or right of whatsoever kind, including any equity or right of redemption of any Pledgor, and each Pledgor hereby
expressly waives all rights of redemption, stay or appraisal, and all rights to require the Administrative Agent to marshal any
assets in favor of such Pledgor or any other party or against or in payment of any or all of the Secured Obligations, that it
has or may have under any rule of law or statute now existing or hereafter adopted. No demand, presentment, protest, advertisement
or notice of any kind (except any notice required by law, as referred to below), all of which are hereby expressly waived by each
Pledgor, shall be required in connection with any sale or other disposition of any part of the Collateral. If any notice of a
proposed sale or other disposition of any part of the Collateral shall be required under applicable law, the Administrative Agent
shall give the applicable Pledgor at least 10 days’ prior notice of the time and place of any public sale and of the time
after which any private sale or other disposition is to be made, which notice each Pledgor agrees is commercially reasonable.
The Administrative Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale of Collateral if it shall determine not to do so, regardless
of the fact that notice of sale may have been given. The Administrative Agent may, without notice or publication, adjourn any
public or private sale or cause the same to be adjourned from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed for sale,
and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which the same was so adjourned. Upon each public
sale and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, upon each private sale, the Administrative Agent may purchase all or any
of the Collateral being sold, free from any equity, right of redemption or other claim or demand, and may make payment therefor
by endorsement and application (without recourse) of the Secured Obligations in lieu of cash as a credit on account of the purchase
price for such Collateral.
 


16 
 

 
6.2          Application
of Proceeds.
 
(a)           All Proceeds collected by the Administrative
Agent upon any sale, other disposition of or realization upon any of the Collateral, together with all other moneys received by
the Administrative Agent hereunder, shall be applied in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Agreement.
 
(b)           In
the event that the proceeds of any such sale, disposition or realization are insufficient to pay all amounts to which the Secured
Parties are legally entitled, the Pledgors shall be jointly and severally liable for the deficiency, together with interest thereon
at the highest rate specified in any applicable Credit Document for interest on overdue principal or such other rate as shall be
fixed by applicable law, together with the costs of collection and all other fees, costs and expenses payable hereunder.
 
(c)           Upon any sale of any Collateral hereunder
by the Administrative Agent (whether by virtue of the power of sale herein granted, pursuant to judicial proceeding, or otherwise),
the receipt of the Administrative Agent or the officer making the sale shall be a sufficient discharge to the purchaser or purchasers
of the Collateral so sold, and such purchaser or purchasers shall not be obligated to see to the application of any part of the
purchase money paid over to the Administrative Agent or such officer or be answerable in any way for the misapplication thereof.
 
6.3           Collateral
Accounts. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Administrative Agent shall have the right
to cause to be established and maintained, at its principal office or such other location or locations as it may establish from
time to time in its discretion, one or more accounts (collectively, “Collateral Accounts”) for the collection
of cash Proceeds of the Collateral. Such Proceeds, when deposited, shall continue to constitute Collateral for the Secured Obligations
and shall not constitute payment thereof until applied as herein provided. The Administrative Agent shall have sole dominion and
control over all funds deposited in any Collateral Account, and such funds may be withdrawn therefrom only by the Administrative
Agent. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Administrative Agent shall have the right to
(and, if directed by the Required Lenders pursuant to the Credit Agreement, shall) apply amounts held in the Collateral Accounts
in payment of the Secured Obligations in the manner provided for in Section 6.2.
 


17 
 

 
6.4           Grant
of License. Each Pledgor hereby grants to the Administrative Agent, effective upon the occurrence and during the continuance
of an Event of Default, an irrevocable, non-exclusive license (exercisable without payment of royalty or other compensation to
any Pledgor) to use, license or sublicense any Patent Collateral, Trademark Collateral or Copyright Collateral now owned or licensed
or hereafter acquired or licensed by such Pledgor, wherever the same may be located throughout the world, for such term or terms,
on such conditions and in such manner as the Administrative Agent shall determine, whether general, special or otherwise, and
whether on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis, and including in such license reasonable access to all media in which any of the
licensed items may be recorded or stored and to all computer software and programs used for the compilation or printout thereof.
The use of such license or sublicense by the Administrative Agent shall be exercised, at the option of the Administrative Agent,
only upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default; provided that any license, sublicense or other
transaction entered into by the Administrative Agent in accordance herewith shall be binding upon each applicable Pledgor notwithstanding
any subsequent cure of an Event of Default.
 
6.5           Private Sales.
 
(a)           Each
Pledgor recognizes that the Administrative Agent may be compelled, at any time after the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default, to conduct any sale of all or any part of the Pledged Interests without registering or
qualifying such Pledged Interests under the Securities Act and/or any applicable state securities laws in effect at such
time. Each Pledgor acknowledges that any such private sales may be made in such manner and under such circumstances as the
Administrative Agent may deem necessary or advisable in its sole and absolute discretion, including at prices and on terms
that might be less favorable than those obtainable through a public sale without such restrictions (including a public
offering made pursuant to a registration statement under the Securities Act), and, notwithstanding such circumstances, agrees
that any such sale shall not be deemed not to have been made in a commercially reasonable manner solely because it was
conducted as a private sale, and agrees that the Administrative Agent shall have no obligation to conduct any public sales
and no obligation to delay the sale of any Pledged Interests for the period of time necessary to permit its registration for
public sale under the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws, and shall not have any responsibility or liability
as a result of its election so not to conduct any such public sales or delay the sale of any Pledged Interests,
notwithstanding the possibility that a substantially higher price might be realized if the sale were deferred until after
such registration. Each Pledgor hereby waives any claims against the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party arising
by reason of the fact that the price at which any Pledged Interests may have been sold at any private sale was less than the
price that might have been obtained at a public sale or was less than the aggregate amount of the Secured Obligations, even
if the Administrative Agent accepts the first offer received and does not offer such Pledged Interests to more than one
offeree.
 


18 
 

 
(b)           Each
Pledgor agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to do or cause to be done all such other acts as may be necessary to make
such sale or sales of any portion of the Collateral pursuant to Section 6.1 and this Section 6.5 valid and binding
and in compliance with all applicable Requirements of Law. Each Pledgor agrees that a breach of any of the covenants contained
in this Section 6.5 will cause irreparable injury to the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties, that the Administrative
Agent and the other Secured Parties have no adequate remedy at law in respect of such breach and, as a consequence, that each and
every covenant contained in this Section shall be specifically enforceable against the Pledgors.
 
6.6           The
Pledgors Remain Liable. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) each Pledgor shall remain liable under all Contracts
to which it is a party included within the Collateral (including all Ownership Agreements) to perform all of its obligations thereunder
to the same extent as if this Agreement had not been executed, (ii) the exercise by the Administrative Agent of any of its rights
or remedies hereunder shall not release any Pledgor from any of its obligations under any of such Contracts, and (iii) except
as specifically provided for herein below, the Administrative Agent shall not have any obligation or liability by reason of this
Agreement under any of such Contracts, nor shall the Administrative Agent be obligated to perform any of the obligations or duties
of any Pledgor thereunder or to take any action to collect or enforce any claim for payment assigned hereunder. The powers, rights
and remedies conferred on the Administrative Agent hereunder are solely to protect its interest and privilege in such Contracts,
as Collateral, and shall not impose any duty upon it to exercise any such powers, rights or remedies.
 
6.7           Waivers.
Each Pledgor, to the greatest extent not prohibited by applicable law, hereby (i) agrees that it will not invoke, claim or assert
the benefit of any rule of law or statute now or hereafter in effect (including any right to prior notice or judicial hearing
in connection with the Administrative Agent’s possession, custody or disposition of any Collateral or any appraisal, valuation,
stay, extension, moratorium or redemption law), or take or omit to take any other action, that would or could reasonably be expected
to have the effect of delaying, impeding or preventing the exercise of any rights and remedies in respect of the Collateral, the
absolute sale of any of the Collateral or the possession thereof by any purchaser at any sale thereof, and waives the benefit
of all such laws and statutes and further agrees that it will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power granted hereunder
to the Administrative Agent, but that it will permit the execution of every such power as though no such laws or statutes were
in effect, (ii) waives all rights that it has or may have under any rule of law or statute now existing or hereafter adopted to
require the Administrative Agent to marshal any Collateral or other assets in favor of such Pledgor or any other party or against
or in payment of any or all of the Secured Obligations, and (iii) waives all rights that it has or may have under any rule of
law or statute now existing or hereafter adopted to demand, presentment, protest, advertisement or notice of any kind (except
notices expressly provided for herein). In addition, each Pledgor waives any and all rights of contribution or subrogation upon
the sale or disposition of all or any portion of the Collateral by the Administrative Agent.

ARTICLE VII
 
THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT
 
7.1          The
Administrative Agent; Standard of Care. The Administrative Agent will hold all items of the Collateral at any time received
under this Agreement in accordance with the provisions hereof. The obligations of the Administrative Agent as holder of the Collateral
and interests therein and with respect to the disposition thereof, and otherwise under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents,
are only those expressly set forth in this Agreement and the other Credit Documents. The Administrative Agent shall act hereunder
at the direction, or with the consent, of the Required Lenders on the terms and conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement.
The powers conferred on the Administrative Agent hereunder are solely to protect its interest, on behalf of the Secured Parties,
in the Collateral, and shall not impose any duty upon it to exercise any such powers. Except for treatment of the Collateral in
its possession in a manner substantially equivalent to that which the Administrative Agent, in its individual capacity, accords
its own property of a similar nature, and the accounting for moneys actually received by it hereunder, the Administrative Agent
shall have no duty as to any Collateral or as to the taking of any necessary steps to preserve rights against prior parties or
any other rights pertaining to the Collateral. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any other Secured Party shall be liable to
any Pledgor (i) for any loss or damage sustained by such Pledgor, or (ii) for any loss, damage, depreciation or other diminution
in the value of any of the Collateral that may occur as a result of or in connection with or that is in any way related to any
exercise by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party of any right or remedy under this Agreement, any failure to demand,
collect or realize upon any of the Collateral or any delay in doing so, or any other act or failure to act on the part of the
Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party, except to the extent that the same is caused by its own gross negligence or willful
misconduct.
 
7.2          Further Assurances;
Attorney-in-Fact.
 
(a)           Each
Pledgor hereby irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent at any time and from time to time to file in any filing office
in any Uniform Commercial Code jurisdiction any financing statements and amendments thereto that (a) indicate the Collateral (i)
as all assets of such Pledgor or words of similar effect, regardless of whether any particular asset included within the Collateral
falls within the scope of Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code of any such jurisdiction, or (ii) as being of an equal or lesser
scope or with greater detail, and (b) provide any other information required by Part 5 of Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial
Code for the sufficiency or filing office acceptance of any financing statement or amendment.
 
(b)           Each
Pledgor agrees that it will do such further acts and things (including making any notice filings with state tax or revenue authorities
required to be made by account creditors in order to enforce any Accounts in such state) and to execute and deliver to the Administrative
Agent such additional conveyances, assignments, agreements and instruments as the Administrative Agent may reasonably require or
deem advisable to perfect, establish, confirm and maintain the security interest and Lien provided for herein, to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement or to further assure and confirm unto the Administrative Agent its rights, powers and remedies hereunder.
 


20 
 

 
(c)           Each
Pledgor hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent its lawful attorney-in-fact, with full authority in the place and
stead of such Pledgor and in the name of such Pledgor, the Administrative Agent or otherwise, and with full power of substitution
in the premises (which power of attorney, being coupled with an interest, is irrevocable for so long as this Agreement shall be
in effect), from time to time in the Administrative Agent’s discretion after the occurrence and during the continuance of
an Event of Default (except for the actions described in clause (i) below, which may be taken by the Administrative Agent without
regard to whether an Event of Default has occurred) to take any action and to execute any instruments that the Administrative
Agent may deem necessary or advisable to accomplish the purpose of this Agreement, including:
 
(i)            to
sign the name of such Pledgor on any financing statement, continuation statement, notice or other similar document that, in the
Administrative Agent’s opinion, should be made or filed in order to perfect or continue perfected the security interest granted
under this Agreement;
 
(ii)           to
ask, demand, collect, sue for, recover, compound, receive and give acquittance and receipts for moneys due and to become due under
or in respect of any of the Collateral;
 
(iii)          to
receive, endorse and collect any checks, drafts, Instruments, Chattel Paper and other orders for the payment of money made payable
to such Pledgor representing any interest, income, dividend, distribution or other amount payable in respect of any of the Collateral
and to give full discharge for the same;
 
(iv)          to
obtain, maintain and adjust any property or casualty insurance required to be maintained by such Pledgor under Section 5.6 of the
Credit Agreement and direct the payment of proceeds thereof to the Administrative Agent;
 
(v)           to
pay or discharge taxes, Liens or other encumbrances levied or placed on or threatened against the Collateral, the legality or validity
thereof and the amounts necessary to discharge the same to be determined by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion, any
such payments made by the Administrative Agent to become Secured Obligations of the Pledgors to the Administrative Agent, due and
payable immediately and without demand;
 
(vi)          to
file any claims or take any action or institute any proceedings that the Administrative Agent may deem necessary or advisable for
the collection of any of the Collateral or otherwise to enforce the rights of the Administrative Agent with respect to any of the
Collateral; and
 
(vii)         to
use, sell, assign, transfer, pledge, make any agreement with respect to or otherwise deal with any and all of the Collateral as
fully and completely as though the Administrative Agent were the absolute owner of the Collateral for all purposes, and to do
from time to time, at the Administrative Agent’s option and the Pledgors’ expense, all other acts and things deemed
necessary by the Administrative Agent to protect, preserve or realize upon the Collateral and to more completely carry out the
purposes of this Agreement.
 


21 
 

 
(d)           If
any Pledgor fails to perform any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement after written request to do so by the Administrative
Agent (provided that no such request shall be necessary at any time after the occurrence and during the continuance of
an Event of Default), the Administrative Agent may itself perform, or cause the performance of, such covenant or agreement and
may take any other action that it deems necessary and appropriate for the maintenance and preservation of the Collateral or its
security interest therein, and the reasonable expenses so incurred in connection therewith shall be payable by the Pledgors under
Section 8.1.
 
ARTICLE VIII
 
MISCELLANEOUS
 
8.1         
Indemnity and Expenses. The provisions of Section 10.1 (“Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver”) of the
Credit Agreement are incorporated herein by reference and shall apply to each Pledgor mutatis mutandis to the same extent
as such provisions apply to the Borrower.
 
8.2          No
Waiver. The rights and remedies of the Secured Parties expressly set forth in this Agreement and the other Credit Documents
are cumulative and in addition to, and not exclusive of, all other rights and remedies available at law, in equity or otherwise.
No failure or delay on the part of any Secured Party in exercising any right, power or privilege shall operate as a waiver thereof,
nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege preclude any other or further exercise thereof
or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege or be construed to be a waiver of any Default or Event of Default. No course
of dealing between the Pledgors and the Secured Parties or their agents or employees shall be effective to amend, modify or discharge
any provision of this Agreement or any other Credit Document or to constitute a waiver of any Default or Event of Default. No
notice to or demand upon any Pledgor in any case shall entitle such Pledgor o

edgor to any other or further notice
or demand in similar or other circumstances or constitute a waiver of the right of any Secured Party to exercise any right or
remedy or take any other or further action in any circumstances without notice or demand.
 
8.3          Enforcement.
By its acceptance of the benefits of this Agreement, each Lender agrees that this Agreement may be enforced only by the Administrative
Agent, acting upon the instructions or with the consent of the Required Lenders as provided for in the Credit Agreement, and that
no Lender shall have any right individually to enforce or seek to enforce this Agreement or to realize upon any Collateral or
other security given to secure the payment and performance of the Secured Obligations.
 
8.4          Amendments,
Waivers, etc. No amendment, modification, waiver, discharge or termination of, or consent to any departure by any Pledgor from,
any provision of this Agreement, shall be effective unless in a writing signed by the Administrative Agent and such of the Lenders
as may be required under Section 10.5 of the Credit Agreement to concur in the action then being taken, and then the same shall
be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given.
 


22 
 

 
8.5          Continuing
Security Interest; Term; Successors and Assigns; Assignment; Termination and Release; Survival. This Agreement shall create
a continuing security interest in the Collateral and shall secure the payment and performance of all of the Secured Obligations
as the same may arise and be outstanding at any time and from time to time from and after the date hereof, and shall (i) remain
in full force and effect until the occurrence of the Termination Requirements (as hereinafter defined), (ii) be binding upon and
enforceable against each Pledgor and its successors and assigns (provided, however, that no Pledgor may sell, assign
or transfer any of its rights, interests, duties or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the Lenders) and
(iii) inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by each Secured Party and its successors and assigns. Upon any sale or other
disposition by any Pledgor of any Collateral in a transaction expressly permitted hereunder or under or pursuant to the Credit
Agreement or any other applicable Credit Document, the Lien and security interest created by this Agreement in and upon such Collateral
shall be automatically released, and upon the satisfaction of all of the Termination Requirements, this Agreement and the Lien
and security interest created hereby shall terminate (provided, that the provisions of Section 6.7 shall survive
the termination of this Agreement); and in connection with any such release or termination, the Administrative Agent, at the request
and expense of the applicable Pledgor, will execute and deliver to such Pledgor such documents and instruments evidencing such
release or termination as such Pledgor may reasonably request and will assign, transfer and deliver to such Pledgor, without recourse
and without representation or warranty, such of the Collateral as may then be in the possession of the Administrative Agent (or,
in the case of any partial release of Collateral, such of the Collateral so being released as may be in its possession). All representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements herein shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and any Pledgor Accession.
For purposes of this Agreement, “Termination Requirements” means (x) the payment in full in cash of the Secured
Obligations (other than contingent and indemnification obligations not then due and payable), and (y) the termination of the Commitments.
 
8.6          Additional
Pledgors. Each Pledgor recognizes that the provisions of the Credit Agreement require certain Persons that become Subsidiaries
of the Borrower, and that are not already parties hereto, to execute and deliver a Pledgor Accession, whereupon each such Person
shall become a Pledgor hereunder with the same force and effect as if originally a Pledgor hereunder on the date hereof, and agrees
that its obligations hereunder shall not be discharged, limited or otherwise affected by reason of the same, or by reason of the
Administrative Agent’s actions in effecting the same or in releasing any Pledgor hereunder, in each case without the necessity
of giving notice to or obtaining the consent of such Pledgor or any other Pledgor.
 
8.7          Notices.
All notices and other communications provided for hereunder shall be given to the parties in the manner and subject to the other
notice provisions set forth in the Credit Agreement and the Guaranty Agreement.
 
8.8          Governing
Law. This Agreement and any claims, controversy, dispute or cause of action (whether in contract or tort or otherwise) based
upon, arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the law of the State
of New York.
 
8.9          Severability.
To the extent any provision of this Agreement is prohibited by or invalid under the applicable law of any jurisdiction, such provision
shall be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity and only in such jurisdiction, without prohibiting or
invalidating such provision in any other jurisdiction or the remaining provisions of this Agreement in any jurisdiction.
 


23 
 

 
8.10        Counterparts.
This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto in different counterparts), each of which shall
constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. Delivery of an executed counterpart
of a signature page of this Agreement by facsimile or in electronic format (e.g., “pdf,” “tif” or similar
file formats) shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

thereunder. In furtherance (and without limitation) of the foregoing, pursuant to Section 2.1 of the Security Agreement, and
as security for all of the Secured Obligations, the New Pledgor hereby pledges, assigns and delivers to the Administrative
Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Secured Parties, and grants to the Administrative Agent, for the ratable benefit of the
Secured Parties, a Lien upon and security interest in, all of its right, title and interest in and to the Collateral as set

distributed in respect of, or in exchange for, any Pledged Interests;
 
 (ii)      dividends
and other distributions paid or payable in cash in respect of any Pledged Interests in connection with a partial or total liquidation
or dissolution or in connection with a reduction of capital, capital surplus or paid-in-surplus; and
 
 (iii)     cash
paid, payable or otherwise distributed in respect of principal of, in redemption of, or in exchange for, any Pledged Interests.
 
(c)         The Administrative Agent shall execute
and deliver (or cause to be executed and delivered) to the Pledgor all such proxies, powers of attorney, consents, ratifications
and waivers and other instruments as the Pledgor may reasonably request for the purpose of enabling the Pledgor to exercise its
voting and other rights in accordance with and to the extent permitted by Section 5.1(a) and to receive dividends or interest
payments in accordance with and to the extent permitted by Section 5.1(b).
 
5.2       Voting
During an Event of Default. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default and notice by the Administrative
Agent to the Pledgor, all rights of the Pledgor to exercise the voting and other consensual rights that it would otherwise be entitled
to exercise pursuant to Section 5.1(a) shall cease, and all such rights shall thereupon become vested in the Administrative
Agent, which shall thereupon have the sole right to exercise such voting and other consensual rights.
 
5.3       Distributions
During an Event of Default. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, all rights of the
Pledgor to receive the dividends, interest and other payments and distributions to which it would otherwise be entitled

which shall thereupon have the sole right to receive and hold as Pledged Interests such dividends, interest and other
payments and distributions. All dividends and interest payments received by the Pledgor in violation of this Section 5.3 shall
be received in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, shall be segregated from other funds of any the Pledgor and

necessary endorsement).

ARTICLE VI
 
REMEDIES
 
6.1           Remedies.
If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to exercise in respect
of the Pledged Interests all of its rights, powers and remedies provided for herein or otherwise available to it under any other
Credit Document, by law, in equity or otherwise, including all rights and remedies of a secured party under the Uniform Commercial
Code, and shall be entitled in particular, but without limitation of the foregoing, to exercise the following rights, which the
Pledgor agrees to be commercially reasonable:
 
(a)           To
exercise (i) all voting, consensual and other rights and powers pertaining to the Pledged Interests (whether or not
transferred into the name of the Administrative Agent), at any meeting of shareholders, partners, members or otherwise, and
(ii) any and all rights of conversion, exchange, subscription and any other rights, privileges or options pertaining to the
Pledged Interests as if it were the absolute owner thereof (including the right to exchange at its discretion any and all of
the Pledged Interests upon the merger, consolidation, reorganization, reclassification, combination of shares or interests,
similar rearrangement or other similar fundamental change in the structure of the applicable issuer, or upon the exercise by
the Pledgor or the Administrative Agent of any right, privilege or option pertaining to such Pledged Interests), and in
connection therewith, the right to deposit and deliver any and all of the Pledged Interests with any committee, depositary,
transfer agent, registrar or other designated agency upon such terms and conditions as the Administrative Agent may
determine, and give all consents, waivers and ratifications in respect of the Pledged Interests, all without liability except
to account for any property actually received by it, but the Administrative Agent shall have no duty to exercise any such
right, privilege or option or give any such consent, waiver or ratification and shall not be responsible for any failure to
do so or delay in so doing; and for the foregoing purposes the Pledgor will promptly execute and deliver or cause to be
executed and delivered to the Administrative Agent, upon request, all such proxies and other instruments as the
Administrative Agent may reasonably request to enable the Administrative Agent to exercise such rights and powers; AND IN
FURTHERANCE OF THE FOREGOING AND WITHOUT LIMITATION THEREOF, THE PLEDGOR HEREBY IRREVOCABLY CONSTITUTES AND APPOINTS
THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AS THE TRUE AND LAWFUL PROXY AND ATTORNEY-IN-FACT OF THE PLEDGOR, WITH FULL POWER OF SUBSTITUTION IN
THE PREMISES, TO EXERCISE ALL SUCH VOTING, CONSENSUAL AND OTHER RIGHTS AND POWERS TO WHICH ANY HOLDER OF ANY PLEDGED
INTERESTS WOULD BE ENTITLED BY VIRTUE OF HOLDING THE SAME, WHICH PROXY AND POWER OF ATTORNEY, BEING COUPLED WITH AN INTEREST,
IS IRREVOCABLE AND SHALL BE EFFECTIVE FOR SO LONG AS THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE IN EFFECT; and
 

8 
 

 
(b)           To
sell, resell, assign and deliver, in its sole discretion, all or any of the Pledged Interests, in one or more parcels, on
any securities exchange on which any Capital Stock may be listed, at public or private sale, at any of the Administrative
Agent’s offices or elsewhere, for cash, upon credit or for future delivery, at such time or times and at such price or
prices and upon such other terms as the Administrative Agent may deem satisfactory. If any of the Pledged Interests are sold
by the Administrative Agent upon credit or for future delivery, the Administrative Agent shall not be liable for the failure
of the purchaser to purchase or pay for the same and, in the event of any such failure, the Administrative Agent may resell
such Pledged Interests. In no event shall the Pledgor be credited with any part of the Proceeds of sale of any Pledged
Interests until and to the extent cash payment in respect thereof has actually been received by the Administrative Agent.
Each purchaser at any such sale shall hold the property sold absolutely, free from any claim or right of whatsoever kind,
including any equity or right of redemption of the Pledgor, and the Pledgor hereby expressly waives all rights of redemption,
stay or appraisal, and all rights to require the Administrative Agent to marshal any assets in favor of the Pledgor or any
other party or against or in payment of any or all of the Secured Obligations, that it has or may have under any rule of law
or statute now existing or hereafter adopted. No demand, presentment, protest, advertisement or notice of any kind (except
any notice required by law, as referred to below), all of which are hereby expressly waived by the Pledgor, shall be required
in connection with any sale or other disposition of any part of the Pledged Interests. If any notice of a proposed sale or
other disposition of any part of the Pledged Interests shall be required under applicable law, the Administrative Agent shall
give the applicable Pledgor at least 10 days’ prior notice of the time and place of any public sale and of the time
after which any private sale or other disposition is to be made, which notice the Pledgor agrees is commercially
reasonable. The Administrative Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale of Pledged Interests if it shall determine not
to do so, regardless of the fact that notice of sale may have been given. The Administrative Agent may, without notice or
publication, adjourn any public or private sale or cause the same to be adjourned from time to time by announcement at the
time and place fixed for sale, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which the same was
so adjourned. Upon each public sale and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, upon each private sale, the
Administrative Agent may purchase all or any of the Pledged Interests being sold, free from any equity, right of redemption
or other claim or demand, and may make payment therefor by endorsement and application (without recourse) of the Secured
Obligations in lieu of cash as a credit on account of the purchase price for such Pledged Interests.
 
6.2           Application
of Proceeds.
 
(a)           All Proceeds collected by the Administrative
Agent upon any sale, other disposition of or realization upon any of the Pledged Interests, together with all other moneys received
by the Administrative Agent hereunder, shall be applied in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Agreement.
 
(b)           In
the event that the proceeds of any such sale, disposition or realization are insufficient to pay all amounts to which the Secured
Parties are legally entitled, the Pledgor shall be liable for the deficiency, together with interest thereon at the highest rate
specified in any applicable Credit Document for interest on overdue principal or such other rate as shall be fixed by applicable
law, together with the costs of collection and all other fees, costs and expenses payable hereunder.
 
(c)           Upon
any sale of any Pledged Interests hereunder by the Administrative Agent (whether by virtue of the power of sale herein
granted, pursuant to judicial proceeding, or otherwise), the receipt of the Administrative Agent or the officer making the
sale shall be a sufficient discharge to the purchaser or purchasers of the Pledged Interests so sold, and such purchaser or
purchasers shall not be obligated to see to the application of any part of the purchase money paid over to the Administrative
Agent or such officer or be answerable in any way for the misapplication thereof.
 

9 
 

 
6.3           Collateral
Accounts. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Administrative Agent shall have the right
to cause to be established and maintained, at its principal office or such other location or locations as it may establish from
time to time in its discretion, one or more accounts (collectively, “Collateral Accounts”) for the collection
of cash Proceeds of the Pledged Interests. Such Proceeds, when deposited, shall continue to constitute Pledged Interests for the
Secured Obligations and shall not constitute payment thereof until applied as herein provided. The Administrative Agent shall have
sole dominion and control over all funds deposited in any Collateral Account, and such funds may be withdrawn therefrom only by
the Administrative Agent. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Administrative Agent shall
have the right to (and, if directed by the Required Lenders pursuant to the Credit Agreement, shall) apply amounts held in the
Collateral Accounts in payment of the Secured Obligations in the manner provided for in Section 6.2.
 
6.4           Private Sales.
 
(a)           The
Pledgor recognizes that the Administrative Agent may be compelled, at any time after the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default, to conduct any sale of all or any part of the Pledged Interests without registering or
qualifying such Pledged Interests under the Securities Act and/or any applicable state securities laws in effect at such
time. The Pledgor acknowledges that any such private sales may be made in such manner and under such circumstances as the
Administrative Agent may deem necessary or advisable in its sole and absolute discretion, including at prices and on terms
that might be less favorable than those obtainable through a public sale without such restrictions (including a public
offering made pursuant to a registration statement under the Securities Act), and, notwithstanding such circumstances, agrees
that any such sale shall not be deemed not to have been made in a commercially reasonable manner solely because it was
conducted as a private sale, and agrees that the Administrative Agent shall have no obligation to conduct any public sales
and no obligation to delay the sale of any Pledged Interests for the period of time necessary to permit its registration for
public sale under the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws, and shall not have any responsibility or liability
as a result of its election so not to conduct any such public sales or delay the sale of any Pledged Interests,
notwithstanding the possibility that a substantially higher price might be realized if the sale were deferred until after
such registration. The Pledgor hereby waives any claims against the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party arising
by reason of the fact that the price at which any Pledged Interests may have been sold at any private sale was less than the
price that might have been obtained at a public sale or was less than the aggregate amount of the Secured Obligations, even
if the Administrative Agent accepts the first offer received and does not offer such Pledged Interests to more than one
offeree.
 
(b)           The
Pledgor agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to do or cause to be done all such other acts as may be necessary to
make such sale or sales of any portion of the Pledged Interests pursuant to Section 6.1 and this Section 6.4 valid
and binding and in compliance with all applicable Requirements of Law. The Pledgor agrees that a breach of any of the
covenants contained in this Section 6.4 will cause irreparable injury to the Administrative Agent and the other
Secured Parties, that the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties have no adequate remedy at law in respect of
such breach and, as a consequence, that each and every covenant contained in this Section shall be specifically enforceable
against the Pledgor.
 

10 
 

 
6.5           The
Pledgor Remains Liable. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) the Pledgor shall remain liable under all
contracts to which it is a party included within the Pledged Interests (including all Ownership Agreements) to perform all of
its obligations thereunder to the same extent as if this Agreement had not been executed, (ii) the exercise by the
Administrative Agent of any of its rights or remedies hereunder shall not release the Pledgor from any of its obligations
under any of such contracts, and (iii) except as specifically provided for herein below, the Administrative Agent shall not
have any obligation or liability by reason of this Agreement under any of such contracts, nor shall the Administrative Agent
be obligated to perform any of the obligations or duties of the Pledgor thereunder or to take any action to collect or
enforce any claim for payment assigned hereunder. The powers, rights and remedies conferred on the Administrative Agent
hereunder are solely to protect its interest and privilege in such contracts, as Pledged Interests, and shall not impose any
duty upon it to exercise any such powers, rights or remedies.
 
6.6           Waivers. The
Pledgor, to the greatest extent not prohibited by applicable law, hereby (i) agrees that it will not invoke, claim or assert
the benefit of any rule of law or statute now or hereafter in effect (including any right to prior notice or judicial
hearing in connection with the Administrative Agent’s possession, custody or disposition of any Pledged Interests or
any appraisal, valuation, stay, extension, moratorium or redemption law), or take or omit to take any other action, that
would or could reasonably be expected to have the effect of delaying, impeding or preventing the exercise of any rights and
remedies in respect of the Pledged Interests, the absolute sale of any of the Pledged Interests or the possession thereof by
any purchaser at any sale thereof, and waives the benefit of all such laws and statutes and further agrees that it will not
hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power granted hereunder to the Administrative Agent, but that it will permit the
execution of every such power as though no such laws or statutes were in effect, (ii) waives all rights that it has or may
have under any rule of law or statute now existing or hereafter adopted to require the Administrative Agent to marshal any
Pledged Interests or other assets in favor of the Pledgor or any other party or against or in payment of any or all of the
Secured Obligations, and (iii) waives all rights that it has or may have under any rule of law or statute now existing or
hereafter adopted to demand, presentment, protest, advertisement or notice of any kind (except notices expressly provided for
herein). In addition, the Pledgor waives any and all rights of contribution or subrogation upon the sale or disposition of
all or any portion of the Pledged Interests by the Administrative Agent.

ARTICLE VII
 
THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT
 
7.1           The
Administrative Agent; Standard of Care. The Administrative Agent will hold all items of the Pledged Interests at any
time received under this Agreement in accordance with the provisions hereof. The obligations of the Administrative Agent as
holder of the Pledged Interests and interests therein and with respect to the disposition thereof, and otherwise under this
Agreement and the other Credit Documents, are only those expressly set forth in this Agreement and the other Credit
Documents. The Administrative Agent shall act hereunder at the direction, or with the consent, of the Required Lenders on the
terms and conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement. The powers conferred on the Administrative Agent hereunder are solely
to protect its interest, on behalf of the Secured Parties, in the Pledged Interests, and shall not impose any duty upon it to
exercise any such powers. Except for treatment of the Pledged Interests in its possession in a manner substantially
equivalent to that which the Administrative Agent, in its individual capacity, accords its own property of a similar nature,
and the accounting for moneys actually received by it hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall have no duty as to any
Pledged Interests or as to the taking of any necessary steps to preserve rights against prior parties or any other rights
pertaining to the Pledged Interests . Neither the Administrative Agent nor any other Secured Party shall be liable to the
Pledgor (i) for any loss or damage sustained by the Pledgor, or (ii) for any loss, damage, depreciation or other diminution
in the value of any of the Pledged Interests that may occur as a result of or in connection with or that is in any way
related to any exercise by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party of any right or remedy under this Agreement,
any failure to demand, collect or realize upon any of the Pledged Interests or any delay in doing so, or any other act or
failure to act on the part of the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party, except to the extent that the same is
caused by its own gross negligence or willful misconduct.
 
7.2           Further Assurances;
Attorney-in-Fact.
 
(a)           The Pledgor hereby irrevocably authorizes
the Administrative Agent at any time and from time to time to file in any filing office in any Uniform Commercial Code jurisdiction
any financing statements and amendments thereto that (a) indicate the Pledged Interests (i) as all assets of the Pledgor or words
of similar effect, regardless of whether any particular asset included within the Pledged Interests falls within the scope of Article
9 of the Uniform Commercial Code of any such jurisdiction, or (ii) as being of an equal or lesser scope or with greater detail,
and (b) provide any other information required by Part 5 of Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code for the sufficiency or filing
office acceptance of any financing statement or amendment.
 
(b)           The
Pledgor agrees that it will do such further acts and things (including making any notice filings with state tax or revenue authorities
required to be made by account creditors in order to enforce any Accounts in such state) and to execute and deliver to the Administrative
Agent such additional conveyances, assignments, agreements and instruments as the Administrative Agent may reasonably require or
deem advisable to perfect, establish, confirm and maintain the security interest and Lien provided for herein, to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement or to further assure and confirm unto the Administrative Agent its rights, powers and remedies hereunder.
 

12 
 

 
(c)          The
Pledgor hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent its lawful attorney-in-fact, with full authority in the place and
stead of the Pledgor and in the name of the Pledgor, the Administrative Agent or otherwise, and with full power of substitution
in the premises (which power of attorney, being coupled with an interest, is irrevocable for so long as this Agreement shall be
in effect), from time to time in the Administrative Agent’s discretion after the occurrence and during the continuance of
an Event of Default (except for the actions described in clause (i) below, which may be taken by the Administrative Agent without
regard to whether an Event of Default has occurred) to take any action and to execute any instruments that the Administrative
Agent may deem necessary or advisable to accomplish the purpose of this Agreement, including:
 
(i)         to
sign the name of the Pledgor on any financing statement, continuation statement, notice or other similar document that, in the
Administrative Agent’s opinion, should be made or filed in order to perfect or continue perfected the security interest granted
under this Agreement;
 
(ii)        to
ask, demand, collect, sue for, recover, compound, receive and give acquittance and receipts for moneys due and to become due under
or in respect of any of the Pledged Interests;
 
(iii)       to
receive, endorse and collect any checks, drafts, Instruments, Chattel Paper and other orders for the payment of money made payable
to the Pledgor representing any interest, income, dividend, distribution or other amount payable in respect of any of the Pledged
Interests and to give full discharge for the same;
 
(iv)       to
obtain, maintain and adjust any property or casualty insurance required to be maintained by the Pledgor under Section 5.6 of the
Credit Agreement and direct the payment of proceeds thereof to the Administrative Agent;
 
(v)        to
pay or discharge taxes, Liens or other encumbrances levied or placed on or threatened against the Pledged Interests, the legality
or validity thereof and the amounts necessary to discharge the same to be determined by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion,
any such payments made by the Administrative Agent to become Secured Obligations of the Pledgor to the Administrative Agent, due
and payable immediately and without demand;
 
(vi)       to
file any claims or take any action or institute any proceedings that the Administrative Agent may deem necessary or advisable for
the collection of any of the Pledged Interests or otherwise to enforce the rights of the Administrative Agent with respect to any
of the Pledged Interests; and
 
(vii)      to
use, sell, assign, transfer, pledge, make any agreement with respect to or otherwise deal with any and all of the Pledged Interests
as fully and completely as though the Administrative Agent were the absolute owner of the Pledged Interests for all purposes, and
to do from time to time, at the Administrative Agent’s option and the Pledgor’s expense, all other acts and things
deemed necessary by the Administrative Agent to protect, preserve or realize upon the Pledged Interests and to more completely
carry out the purposes of this Agreement.
 
(d)          If
the Pledgor fails to perform any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement after written request to do so by the
Administrative Agent (provided that no such request shall be necessary at any time after the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default), the Administrative Agent may itself perform, or cause the performance of, such covenant
or agreement and may take any other action that it deems necessary and appropriate for the maintenance and preservation of
the Pledged Interests or its security interest therein, and the reasonable expenses so incurred in connection therewith shall
be payable by the Pledgor under Section 8.1.
 

13 
 

 
ARTICLE VIII
 
MISCELLANEOUS
 
8.1           Indemnity and Expenses. The provisions of Section 10.1 (“Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver”) of the
Credit Agreement are incorporated herein by reference and shall apply to the Pledgor mutatis mutandis to the same extent
as such provisions apply to the Borrower.
 
8.2           No
Waiver. The rights and remedies of the Secured Parties expressly set forth in this Agreement and the other Credit
Documents are cumulative and in addition to, and not exclusive of, all other rights and remedies available at law, in equity
or otherwise. No failure or delay on the part of any Secured Party in exercising any right, power or privilege shall operate
as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege or be construed to be a waiver of any Default
or Event of Default. No course of dealing between the Pledgor and the Secured Parties or their agents or employees shall be
effective to amend, modify or discharge any provision of this Agreement or any other Credit Document or to constitute a
waiver of any Default or Event of Default. No notice to or demand upon the Pledgor in any case shall entitle the Pledgor to

any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances or constitute a waiver of the right of any Secured
Party to exercise any right or remedy or take any other or further action in any circumstances without notice or demand.
 
8.3           Enforcement.
By its acceptance of the benefits of this Agreement, each Lender agrees that this Agreement may be enforced only by the Administrative
Agent, acting upon the instructions or with the consent of the Required Lenders as provided for in the Credit Agreement, and that
no Lender shall have any right individually to enforce or seek to enforce this Agreement or to realize upon any Pledged Interests
or other security given to secure the payment and performance of the Secured Obligations.
 
8.4           Amendments,
Waivers, etc. No amendment, modification, waiver, discharge or termination of, or consent to any departure by the Pledgor
from, any provision of this Agreement, shall be effective unless in a writing signed by the Administrative Agent and such of the
Lenders as may be required under Section 10.5 of the Credit Agreement to concur in the action then being taken, and then the same
shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given.
 

14 
 

 
8.5           Continuing
Security Interest; Term; Successors and Assigns; Assignment; Termination and Release; Survival. This Agreement shall
create a continuing security interest in the Pledged Interests and shall secure the payment and performance of all of the
Secured Obligations as the same may arise and be outstanding at any time and from time to time from and after the date
hereof, and shall (i) remain in full force and effect until the occurrence of the Termination Requirements (as hereinafter
defined), (ii) be binding upon and enforceable against the Pledgor and its successors and assigns (provided, however,
that Pledgor may not sell, assign or transfer any of its rights, interests, duties or obligations hereunder without the prior
written consent of the Lenders) and (iii) inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by each Secured Party and its successors
and assigns. Upon any sale or other disposition by the Pledgor of any Pledged Interests in a transaction expressly permitted
hereunder or under or pursuant to the Credit Agreement or any other applicable Credit Document, the Lien and security
interest created by this Agreement in and upon such Pledged Interests shall be automatically released, and upon the
satisfaction of all of the Termination Requirements, this Agreement and the Lien and security interest created hereby shall
terminate (provided, that the provisions of Section 6.6 shall survive the termination of this Agreement); and
in connection with any such release or termination, the Administrative Agent, at the request and expense of the Pledgor, will
execute and deliver to the Pledgor such documents and instruments evidencing such release or termination as the Pledgor may
reasonably request and will assign, transfer and deliver to the Pledgor, without recourse and without representation or
warranty, such of the Pledged Interests as may then be in the possession of the Administrative Agent (or, in the case of any
partial release of Pledged Interests, such of the Pledged Interests so being released as may be in its possession). All
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements herein shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement. For
purposes of this Agreement, “Termination Requirements” means (x) the payment in full in cash of the
Secured Obligations (other than contingent and indemnification obligations not then due and payable), and (y) the termination
of the Commitments.
 
8.6           Notices.
All notices and other communications provided for hereunder shall be given to the parties in the manner and subject to the other
notice provisions set forth in the Credit Agreement and the Guaranty Agreement.
 
8.7           Governing
Law. This Agreement and any claims, controversy, dispute or cause of action (whether in contract or tort or otherwise) based
upon, arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordanc

sdiction, such provision
shall be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity and only in such jurisdiction, without prohibiting or
invalidating such provision in any other jurisdiction or the remaining provisions of this Agreement in any jurisdiction.
 
8.9           Counterparts.
This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto in different counterparts), each of which shall
constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. Delivery of an executed counterpart

GUARANTY
AGREEMENT
 
THIS
GUARANTY AGREEMENT, dated as of the 5th day of January, 2018 (this “Guaranty”), is made by GREENBACKER
RENEWABLE ENERGY COMPANY LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “Parent”), GREENBACKER RENEWABLE
ENERGY CORPORATION, a Maryland corporation (“Intermediate Holdco”), and each Subsidiary of GREC ENTITY
HOLDCO LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “Borrower”), that, after the date hereof, executes
an instrument of accession hereto substantially in the form of Exhibit A (a “Guarantor Accession”; such
Subsidiaries of the Borrower collectively, the “Subsidiary Guarantors” and together with the Parent and Intermediate
Holdco, the “Guarantors”), in favor of the Guaranteed Parties (as hereinafter defined). Capitalized terms used
herein without definition shall have the meanings given to them in the Credit Agreement referred to below.
 
RECITALS
 
A.         The
Borrower, the Parent, Intermediate Holdco, the Lenders, and Fifth Third Bank, as a Lender and as Administrative Agent for the
Lenders (in such capacity, the “Administrative Agent”), are parties to a Credit Agreement, dated as of the
date hereof (as amended, modified, restated or supplemented from time to time, the “Credit Agreement”), providing
for the availability of certain credit facilities to the Borrower upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein.
 
B.          It
is a condition to the extension of credit to the Borrower under the Credit Agreement that each Guarantor party hereto on the date
hereof shall have agreed, by executing and delivering this Guaranty, to guarantee to the Guaranteed Parties the payment in full
of the Guaranteed Obligations (as hereinafter defined). The Guaranteed Parties are relying on this Guaranty in their decision
to extend credit to the Borrower under the Credit Agreement, and would not enter into the Credit Agreement without this Guaranty.
 
C.          The
Borrower and the Guarantors are engaged in related businesses and undertake certain activities and operations on an integrated
basis. Intermediate Holdco owns all of the issued and outstanding equity interests in the Borrower, and the Parent owns all of
the issued and outstanding equity interests in Intermediate Holdco. In addition, as part of such integrated operations, the Borrower,
among other things, will advance to the Subsidiary Guarantors from time to time certain proceeds of the Loans made to the Borrower
by the Lenders under the Credit Agreement. Each Guarantor will therefore obtain benefits as a result of the extension of credit
to the Borrower under the Credit Agreement, which benefits are hereby acknowledged, and, accordingly, desires to execute and deliver
this Guaranty.
 
STATEMENT
OF AGREEMENT
 
NOW,
THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, to induce the Guaranteed Parties to enter into the Credit Agreement and to induce the Lenders to extend
credit to the Borrower thereunder, each Guarantor hereby agrees as follows:
 


 
 

 
1.          Guaranty.
 
(a)         Each
Guarantor hereby irrevocably, absolutely and unconditionally, and jointly and severally guarantees (A) to the Lenders and
the Administrative Agent (together with any Rate Management Party described in clause (B) below and any Cash Management Bank
described in clause (C) below, collectively, the “Guaranteed Parties”) the full and prompt payment, at any
time and from time to time as and when due (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), of all Obligations
of the Borrower under the Credit Agreement and the other Credit Documents, or any Rate Management Agreement or Cash
Management Agreement to which any Credit Party and any Cash Management Bank or any Rate Management Party are parties,
including all principal of and interest on the Loans, all fees, expenses, indemnities and other amounts payable by the
Borrower under the Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document (including interest accruing after the filing of a petition
or commencement of a case by or with respect to the Borrower seeking relief under any Debtor Relief Laws, whether or not the
claim for such interest is allowed in such proceeding), and all Obligations that, but for the operation of the automatic stay
under Section 362(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, would become due (other than Excluded Swap Obligations); (B) to each Rate
Management Party under any Rate Management Agreement that is required or permitted by the Credit Agreement to be entered into
by any Credit Party (a “Permitted Rate Management Agreement”), all obligations of such Credit Party under
such Permitted Rate Management Agreement (other than Excluded Swap Obligations); and (C) to each Cash Management Bank under
any Cash Management Agreement entered into by any Credit Party (a “Guaranteed Cash Management Agreement”),
all of the obligations of such Credit Party under such Cash Management Agreement (other than Excluded Swap Obligations); in
each case under clauses (A) through (C), whether now existing or hereafter created or arising and whether direct or indirect,
absolute or contingent, due or to become due (all liabilities and obligations described in this Section 1(a),
collectively, the “Guaranteed Obligations”).
 
(b)        The
provisions of Section 10.1 (“Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver”) of the Credit Agreement are incorporated
herein by reference and shall apply to each Guarantor mutatis mutandis to the same extent as such provisions apply to the
Borrower.
 
(c)        Notwithstanding
the provisions of Section 1(a) and notwithstanding any other provisions contained herein or in any other Credit Document:
 
(i)         no
provision of this Guaranty shall require or permit the collection from any Guarantor of interest in excess of the maximum rate
or amount that such Guarantor may be required or permitted to pay pursuant to applicable law; and
 
(ii)        the
liability of each Subsidiary Guarantor under this Guaranty as of any date shall be limited to a maximum aggregate amount
(the “Maximum Guaranteed Amount”) equal to the greatest amount that would not render such
Guarantor’s obligations under this Guaranty subject to avoidance, discharge or reduction as of such date as a
fraudulent transfer or conveyance under any Debtor Relief Law, in each instance after giving effect to all other liabilities
of such Guarantor, contingent or otherwise, that are relevant under applicable Debtor Relief Laws (specifically excluding,
however, any liabilities of such Guarantor in respect of intercompany indebtedness to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates
to the extent that such indebtedness would be discharged in an amount equal to the amount paid by such Guarantor hereunder,
and after giving effect as assets to the value (as determined under applicable Debtor Relief Laws) of any rights to
subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or similar rights of such Guarantor pursuant to (x) applicable law or (y)
any agreement (including this Guaranty) providing for an equitable allocation among such Guarantor and other Affiliates of
the Borrower of obligations arising under guaranties by such parties).
 


 2
 

 
(d)        The
Subsidiary Guarantors desire to allocate among themselves, in a fair and equitable manner, their obligations arising under
this Guaranty. Accordingly, in the event any payment or distribution is made hereunder on any date by a Subsidiary Guarantor
(a “Funding Guarantor”) that exceeds its Fair Share (as hereinafter defined) as of such date, that Funding
Guarantor shall be entitled to a contribution from each of the other Subsidiary Guarantors in the amount of such other
Guarantor’s Fair Share Shortfall (as hereinafter defined) as of such date, with the result that all such contributions
will cause each Subsidiary Guarantor’s Aggregate Payments (as hereinafter defined) to equal its Fair Share as of such
date. “Fair Share” means, with respect to a Subsidiary Guarantor as of any date of determination, an
amount equal to (i) the ratio of (x) the Adjusted Maximum Guaranteed Amount (as hereinafter defined) w

 respect thereof or any Collateral or other security for any of the foregoing; any sale, exchange, release,
substitution, compromise or other action in respect of any such Collateral or other security; or any failure to create,
protect, perfect, secure, insure, continue or maintain any Liens in any such Collateral or other security;
 
(vi)       the
exercise of any right or remedy available under the Credit Documents, at law, in equity or otherwise in respect of any Collateral
or other security for any Guaranteed Obligations or for any guaranty or other liability in respect thereof, in any order and by
any manner thereby permitted, including foreclosure on any such Collateral or other security by any manner of sale thereby permitted,
whether or not every aspect of such sale is commercially reasonable;
 
(vii)      any
bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, liquidation, insolvency, dissolution, termination, reorganization or other change
in the corporate structure or existence of the Borrower or any other Person directly or indirectly liable for any Guaranteed
Obligations;
 


 4
 

 
(viii)  
  any manner of application of any payments by or amounts received or collected from any Person, by whomsoever paid
and howsoever realized, whether in reduction of any Guaranteed Obligations or any other obligations of the Borrower or any
other Person directly or indirectly liable for any Guaranteed Obligations, regardless of what Guaranteed Obligations may
remain unpaid after any such application; or
 
(ix)       any
other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or a defense, setoff or counterclaim
available to, the Borrower, any Guarantor or a surety or guarantor generally, other than the occurrence of all of the
following: (A) the payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations (other than contingent and indemnification
obligations not then due and payable and other than Obligations described in the following clause (C), except as expressly
set forth therein), (B) the termination of the Commitments and (C) the termination of, and settlement of all obligations of
each Credit Party under, each Permitted Rate Management Agreement to which any Rate Management Party is a party and each
Guaranteed Cash Management Agreement to which any Cash Management Bank is a party (the events in clauses (A), (B) and (C)
above, collectively, the “Termination Requirements”).
 
3.          Certain
Waivers. Each Guarantor hereby knowingly, voluntarily and expressly waives:
 
(i)         presentment,
demand for payment, demand for performance, protest and notice of any other kind, including notice of nonpayment or other nonperformance
(including notice of default under any Credit Document with respect to any Guaranteed Obligations), protest, dishonor, acceptance
hereof, extension of additional credit to the Borrower and of any of the matters referred to in Section 2 and of any rights
to consent thereto;
 
(ii)        any
right to require the Guaranteed Parties or any of them, as a condition of payment or performance by such Guarantor
hereunder, to proceed against, or to exhaust or have resort to any Collateral or other security from or any deposit balance
or other credit in favor of, the Borrower, any other Guarantor or any other Person directly or indirectly liable for any
Guaranteed Obligations, or to pursue any other remedy or enforce any other right; and any other defense based on an election
of remedies with respect to any Collateral or other security for any Guaranteed Obligations or for any guaranty or other
liability in respect thereof, notwithstanding that any such election (including any failure to pursue or enforce any rights
or remedies) may impair or extinguish any right of indemnification, contribution, reimbursement or subrogation or other right
or remedy of any Guarantor against the Borrower, any other Guarantor or any other Person directly or indirectly liable for
any Guaranteed Obligations or any such Collateral or other security;
 


 5
 

 
(iii)       any
right or defense based on or arising by reason of any right or defense of the Borrower or any other Person, including any
defense based on or arising from a lack of authority or other disability of the Borrower or any other Person, the invalidity
or unenforceability of any Guaranteed Obligations, any Collateral or other security therefor or any Credit Document or other
agreement or instrument delivered pursuant thereto, or the cessation of the liability of the Borrower for any reason other
than the satisfaction of the Termination Requirements;
 
(iv)       any
defense based on any Guaranteed Party’s acts or omissions in the administration of the Guaranteed Obligations, any guaranty
or other liability in respect thereof or any Collateral or other security for any of the foregoing, and promptness, diligence
or any requirement that any Guaranteed Party create, protect, perfect, secure, insure, continue or maintain any Liens in any such
Collateral or other security;
 
(v)        any
right to assert against any Guaranteed Party, as a defense, counterclaim, crossclaim or setoff, any defense, counterclaim, claim,
right of recoupment or setoff that it may at any time have against any Guaranteed Party (including failure of consideration, fraud,
fraudulent inducement, statute of limitations, payment, accord and satisfaction and usury), other than compulsory counterclaims
and other than the payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations; and
 
(vi)       any
defense based on or afforded by any applicable law that limits the liability of or exonerates guarantors or sureties or that may
in any other way conflict with the terms of this Guaranty.
 
4.            No
Subrogation. Until the payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations (other than contingent and indemnification
obligations not then due and payable), each Guarantor hereby waives, and agrees that it will not exercise or seek to
exercise, any claim or right that it may have against the Borrower or any other Guarantor at any time as a result of any
payment made under or in connection with this Guaranty or the performance or enforcement hereof, including any right of
subrogation to the rights of any of the Guaranteed Parties against the Borrower or any other Guarantor, any right of
indemnity, contribution or reimbursement against the Borrower or any other Guarantor (including rights of contribution as set
forth in Section 1(c)), any right to enforce any remedies of any Guaranteed Party against the Borrower or any other
Guarantor, or any benefit of, or any right to participate in, any Collateral or other security held by any Guaranteed Party
to secure payment of the Guaranteed Obligations, in each case whether such claims or rights arise by contract, statute
(including the Bankruptcy Code), common law or otherwise. Each Guarantor further agrees that all indebtedness and other
obligations, whether now or hereafter existing, of the Borrower or any other Subsidiary of the Borrower to such Guarantor,
including any such indebtedness in any proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code and any intercompany receivables, together with
any interest thereon, shall be, and hereby are, subordinated and made junior in right of payment to the
Guaranteed Obligations. Each Guarantor further agrees that if any amount shall be paid to or any distribution received by any
Guarantor (i) on account of any such indebtedness at any time after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
Default, or (ii) on account of any rights of contribution at any time prior to the satisfaction of the Termination
Requirements, such amount or distribution shall be deemed to have been received and to be held in trust for the benefit of
the Guaranteed Parties, and shall forthwith be delivered to the Administrative Agent in the form received (with any necessary
endorsements in the case of written instruments), to be applied against the Guaranteed Obligations, whether or not matured,
in accordance with the terms of the applicable Credit Documents and without in any way discharging, limiting or otherwise
affecting the liability of such Guarantor under any other provision of this Guaranty. Additionally, in the event the Borrower
or any other Credit Party becomes a “debtor” within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Code, the Administrative Agent
shall be entitled, at its option, on behalf of the Guaranteed Parties and as attorney-in-fact for each Guarantor, and is
hereby authorized and appointed by each Guarantor, to file proofs of claim on behalf of each relevant Guarantor and vote the
rights of each such Guarantor in any plan of reorganization, and to demand, sue for, collect and receive every payment and
distribution on any indebtedness of the Borrower or such Credit Party to any Guarantor in any such proceeding, each Guarantor
hereby assigning to the Administrative Agent all of its rights in respect of any such claim, including the right to receive
payments and distributions in respect thereof.
 


 6
 

 
5.          Representations
and Warranties. Each Guarantor hereby represents and warrants to the Guaranteed Parties that, as to itself, all of the representations
and warranties relating to it contained in the Credit Agreement are true and correct in all material respects (without duplication
of any materiality qualifier contained therein) as of the date hereof (except to the extent any such representation or warranty
is expressly stated to have been made as of a specific date, in which case such representation or warranty shall be true and correct
as of such date).
 
6.          Financial
Condition of Borrower. Each Guarantor represents that it has knowledge of the Borrower’s financial condition and affairs
and that it has adequate means to obtain from the Borrower on an ongoing basis information relating thereto and to the Borrower’s
ability to pay and perform the Guaranteed Obligations, and agrees to assume the responsibility for keeping, and to keep, so informed
for so long as this Guaranty is in effect with respect to such Guarantor. Each Guarantor agrees that the Guaranteed Parties shall
have no obligation to investigate the financial condition or affairs of the Borrower for the benefit of any Guarantor nor to advise
any Guarantor of any fact respecting, or any change in, the financial condition or affairs of the Borrower that might become known
to any Guaranteed Party at any time, whether or not such Guaranteed Party knows or believes or has reason to know or believe that
any such fact or change is unknown to any Guarantor, or might (or does) materially increase the risk of any Guarantor as guarantor,
or might (or would) affect the willingness of any Guarantor to continue as a guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations.
 
7.        Payments;
Application; Setoff.
 
(a)        Each
Guarantor agrees that, upon the failure of the Borrower to pay any Guaranteed Obligations when and as the same shall become
due (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), and without limitation of any other right or remedy that
any Guaranteed Party may have at law, in equity or otherwise against such Guarantor, such Guarantor will, subject to the
provisions of Section 1(c), forthwith pay or cause to be paid to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the
Guaranteed Parties, an amount equal to the amount of the Guaranteed Obligations then due and owing as aforesaid.
 
(b)        All
payments made by each Guarantor hereunder will be made in Dollars to the Administrative Agent, without setoff, counterclaim
or other defense and, in accordance with the Credit Agreement, free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified
Taxes or Other Taxes, each Guarantor hereby agreeing to comply with and be bound by the provisions of the Credit Agreement in
respect of all payments made by it hereunder.
 


 7
 

 
(c)        All
payments made hereunder shall be applied in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.10 of the Credit Agreement. For purposes
of applying amounts in accordance with this Section 7(c), the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any Guaranteed
Party that has entered into a Permitted Rate Management Agreement or Guaranteed Cash Management Agreement for a determination
(which such Guaranteed Party agrees to provide or cause to be provided upon request of the Administrative Agent) of the outstanding
Guaranteed Obligations owed to such Guaranteed Party under any such Permitted Rate Management Agreement or Guaranteed Cash Management
Agreement. Unless it has actual knowledge (including by way of written notice from any such Guaranteed Party) to the contrary,
the Administrative Agent, in acting hereunder, shall be entitled to assume that no Permitted Rate Management Agreements or Guaranteed
Cash Management Agreement, or Guaranteed Obligations in respect thereof, are in existence between any Guaranteed Party and any
Credit Party. If any Lender or Affiliate thereof that is a party to a Permitted Rate Management Agreement or Guaranteed Cash Management
Agreement (the obligations of the applicable Credit Party under which are Guaranteed Obligations) ceases to be a Lender or Affiliate
thereof, such former Lender or Affiliate thereof shall nevertheless continue to be a Guaranteed Party hereunder with respect to
the Guaranteed Obligations under such Permitted Rate Management Agreement or Guaranteed Cash Management Agreement.
 
(d)        In
the event that the proceeds of any such sale, disposition or realization are insufficient to pay all amounts to which the Guaranteed
Parties are legally entitled, the Guarantors shall be jointly and severally liable for the deficiency,

 by
applicable law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, in
whatever currency) at any time held and other obligations (in whatever currency) at any time owing by such Guaranteed Party
or any such Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of any Guarantor against any and all of the obligations of such
Guarantor now or hereafter existing under this Guaranty or any other Credit Document to such Guaranteed Party, irrespective
of whether or not such Guaranteed Party shall have made any demand under this Guaranty or any other Credit Document and
although such obligations of such Guarantor may be contingent or unmatured or are owed to a branch or office of such
Guaranteed Party different from the branch or office holding such deposit or obligated on such indebtedness; provided
that, in the event that any Defaulting Lender shall exercise any such right of setoff, (i) all amounts so offset shall be
paid over immediately to the Administrative Agent for further application in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.18
of the Credit Agreement and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and
deemed held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and (ii) such Defaulting Lender shall
provide promptly to the Administrative Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the obligations owing to such
Defaulting Lender as to which it exercised such right of setoff. The rights of each Guaranteed Party and their
respective Affiliates under this Section 7(e) are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of
setoff) that such Guaranteed Parties or their respective Affiliates may have. Each Guaranteed Party agrees to notify the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent promptly after any such setoff and application; provided that the failure to
give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application.
 


 8
 

 
8.          No
Waiver. The rights and remedies of the Guaranteed Parties expressly set forth in this Guaranty and the other Credit
Documents are cumulative and in addition to, and not exclusive of, all other rights and remedies available at law, in equity
or otherwise. No failure or delay on the part of any Guaranteed Party in exercising any right, power or privilege shall
operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege or be construed to be a waiver of
any Default or Event of Default. No course of dealing between any of the Guarantors and the Guaranteed Parties or their
agents or employees shall be effective to amend, modify or discharge any provision of this Guaranty or any other Credit
Document or to constitute a waiver of any Default or Event of Default. No notice to or demand upon any Guarantor in any case
shall entitle such Guarantor or any other Guarantor to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other
circumstances or constitute a waiver of the right of any Guaranteed Party to exercise any right or remedy or take any other
or further action in any circumstances without notice or demand.
 
9.          Enforcement.
The Guaranteed Parties agree that, except as provided in Section 7(e), this Guaranty may be enforced only by the
Administrative Agent, acting upon the instructions or with the consent of the Required Lenders as provided for in the Credit
Agreement, and that no Guaranteed Party shall have any right individually to enforce or seek to enforce this Guaranty or to
realize upon any Collateral or other security given to secure the payment and performance of the Guarantors’
obligations hereunder. The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder are independent of the Guaranteed Obligations, and a
separate action or actions may be brought against each Guarantor whether or not any action is brought against the Borrower or
any other Guarantor and whether or not the Borrower or any other Guarantor is joined in any such action. Each Guarantor
agrees that to the extent all or part of any payment of the Guaranteed Obligations made by any Person is subsequently
invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required to be repaid by or on behalf of any Guaranteed
Party to a trustee, receiver or any other party under any Debtor Relief Laws (the amount of any such payment, a
“Reclaimed Amount”), then, to the extent of such Reclaimed Amount, this Guaranty shall continue in full
force and effect or be revived and reinstated, as the case may be, as to the Guaranteed Obligations intended to be satisfied
as if such payment had not been received; and each Guarantor acknowledges that the term “Guaranteed Obligations”
includes all Reclaimed Amounts that may arise from time to time.
 
10.        Amendments,
Waivers, etc. No amendment, modification, waiver, discharge or termination of, or consent to any departure by any Guarantor
from, any provision of this Guaranty, shall be effective unless in a writing signed by the Guarantor directly affected thereby,
the Administrative Agent and such of the Lenders as may be required under Section 10.5 of the Credit Agreement to concur in the
action then being taken, and then the same shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which
given.
 


 9
 

 
11.        Addition,
Release of Guarantors. Each Guarantor recognizes that the provisions of the Credit Agreement require Persons that become Subsidiaries
of the Borrower and that are not already parties hereto to become Guarantors hereunder by executing a Guarantor Accession, and
agrees that its obligations hereunder shall not be discharged, limited or otherwise affected by reason of the same, or by reason
of the Administrative Agent’s actions in effecting the same or in releasing any Guarantor hereunder, in each case without
the necessity of giving notice to or obtaining the consent of any other Guarantor.
 
12.        Continuing
Guaranty; Term; Successors and Assigns; Assignment; Survival. This Guaranty is a continuing guaranty and covers all of the
Guaranteed Obligations as the same may arise and be outstanding at any time and from time to time from and after the date hereof,
and shall (i) remain in full force and effect until satisfaction of all of the Termination Requirements (provided that
the provisions of Section 1(a)(ii) and 4 shall survive any termination of this Guaranty), (ii) be binding upon and
enforceable against each Guarantor and its successors and assigns (provided, however, that no Guarantor may sell, assign
or transfer any of its rights, interests, duties or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the Lenders) and
(iii) inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by each Guara

h the provisions of the Credit Agreement, assign
all or a portion of the Guaranteed Obligations held by it (including by the sale of participations), whereupon each Person that
becomes the holder of any such Guaranteed Obligations shall (except as may be otherwise agreed between such Guaranteed Party and
such Person) have and may exercise all of the rights and benefits in respect thereof granted to such Guaranteed Party under this
Guaranty or otherwise. Each Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives notice of and consents in advance to the assignment as provided
above from time to time by any Guaranteed Party of all or any portion of the Guaranteed Obligations held by it and of the corresponding
rights and interests of such Guaranteed Party hereunder in connection therewith. All representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements herein shall survive the execution and delivery of this Guaranty and any Guarantor Accession.
 
13.        Governing
Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Appointment of Borrower as Representative, Process Agent, Attorney-in-Fact.
 
(a)        This
Guaranty and any claims, controversy, dispute or cause of action (whether in contract or tort or otherwise) based upon, arising
out of or relating to this Guaranty shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State
of New York.
 
(b)        Each
Guarantor irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
the State of New York sitting in the City and County of New York and of the United States District Court of the Southern
District of New York, and any appellate court from any thereof in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Guaranty or any other Credit Document, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto
irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and
determined in such state court or, 

her
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Guaranty or in any other Credit
Document shall affect any right that any Guaranteed Party may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to
this Guaranty or any other Credit Document against any Guarantor or its properties in the courts of any
jurisdiction.
 


 10
 

 
(c)        Each
Guarantor irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any objection that it may
now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Guaranty or any other
Credit Document in any court referred to in Section 13(b). Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding
in any such court.
 
(d)        Each
Guarantor hereby irrevocably designates and appoints the Borrower as its designee, appointee and agent to receive on its behalf
all service of process in any such action or proceeding and any other notice or communication hereunder, irrevocably consents
to service of process in any such action or proceeding by registered or certified mail directed to the Borrower at its address
set forth in the Credit Agreement (and service so made shall be deemed to be completed upon the earlier of actual receipt thereof
or three business days after deposit in the United States mails, proper postage prepaid and properly addressed), and irrevocably
agrees that service so made shall be effective and binding upon such Guarantor in every respect and that any other notice or communication
given to the Borrower at the address and in the manner specified herein shall be effective notice to such Guarantor. Nothing in
this Section 13(d) shall affect the right of any party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law or affect
the right of any Guaranteed Party to bring any action or proceeding against any Guarantor in the courts of any other jurisdiction.
 
(e)         Further,
each Guarantor does hereby irrevocably make, constitute and appoint the Borrower as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact, with
full authority in its place and stead and in its name, the Borrower’s name or otherwise, and with full power of substitution
in the premises, from time to time in the Borrower’s discretion to agree on behalf of, and sign the name of, such Guarantor
to any amendment, modification or supplement to, restatement of, or waiver or consent in connection with, this Guaranty, any other
Credit Document or any document or instrument pursuant hereto or thereto, and to take any other action and do all other things
on behalf of such Guarantor that the Borrower may deem necessary or advisable to carry out and accomplish the purposes of this
Guaranty and the other Credit Documents. The Borrower will not be liable for any act or omission nor for any error of judgment
or mistake of fact unless the same shall occur as a result of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Borrower. This
power, being coupled with an interest, is irrevocable by any Guarantor for so long as this Guaranty shall be in effect with respect
to such Guarantor. By its signature hereto, the Borrower consents to its appointment as provided for herein and agrees promptly
to distribute all process, notices and other communications to each Guarantor.
