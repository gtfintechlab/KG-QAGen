(b) (i) Each Swing Line Borrowing shall be made on notice, given not later than 11:00 A.M. on the date of the proposed Swing
Line Borrowing, by the Borrower to the Swing Line Bank and the Administrative Agent. Each such notice of a Swing Line Borrowing (a Notice of Swing Line Borrowing) shall be in writing, or by telephone, confirmed promptly in
writing, or telex or telecopier, specifying therein the requested (i) date of such Borrowing, (ii) amount of such Borrowing and (iii) maturity of such Borrowing (which maturity shall be no later than the seventh day after the
requested date of such Borrowing). The Swing Line Bank will make the amount of the requested Swing Line Advances available to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agents Account, in same day funds. After the Administrative
Agents receipt of such funds and upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in Article III, the Administrative Agent will make such funds available to the Borrower by crediting the Borrowers Account no later than 2:00
P.M. on the date of such Borrowing.  (ii) The Swing Line Bank may, at any time in its sole and absolute discretion, request
on behalf of the Borrower (and the Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes the Swing Line Bank to so request on its behalf) that each Lender make a Base Rate Advance in an amount equal to such Lenders Pro Rata Share of the amount of Swing Line
Advances then outstanding. Such request shall be deemed to be a Notice of Borrowing for purposes hereof and shall be made in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.02(a) without regard solely to the minimum amounts specified therein
but subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 3.02. The Swing Line Bank shall furnish the Borrower with a copy of the applicable Notice of Borrowing promptly after delivering such notice to the Administrative
Agent. Each Lender shall make an amount equal to its Pro Rata Share of the amount specified in such Notice of Borrowing available for the account of its Applicable Lending Office to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swing Line Bank, by
deposit to the Administrative Agents Account, in same date funds, not later than 11:00 A.M. on the day specified in such Notice of Borrowing. 
  28 


(iii) If for any reason any Swing Line Advance cannot be refinanced by a
Revolving Credit Borrowing as contemplated by Section 2.02(b)(ii), the request for Base Rate Advances submitted by the Swing Line Bank as set forth in Section 2.02(b)(ii) shall be deemed to be a request by the Swing Line Bank
that each of the Lenders fund its risk participation in the relevant Swing Line Advance and each Lenders payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swing Line Bank pursuant to Section 2.02(b)(ii) shall be deemed
payment in respect of such participation.  (iv) If and to the extent that any Lender shall not have made the amount of its
Pro Rata Share of such Swing Line Advance available to the Administrative Agent in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.02(b)(ii), such Lender agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount together with
interest thereon, for each day from the date of the applicable Notice of Borrowing delivered by the Swing Line Bank until the date such amount is paid to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate plus 1/2 of 1%. 
(v) Each Lenders obligation to make Revolving Credit Advances or to purchase and fund risk participations in Swing Line
Advance pursuant to this Section 2.02(b) shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have
against the Swing Line Bank, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing;
provided, however, that each Lenders obligation to make Revolving Credit Advances pursuant to Section 2.02(b)(ii) is subject to satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 3.02. No funding of risk
participations shall relieve or otherwise impair the Obligation of the Borrower to repay Swing Line Advances, together with interest as provided herein. 
(c) Anything in Section 2.02(a) to the contrary notwithstanding, (i) subject to receipt by the Administrative
Agent not later than 11:00 A.M. on the third Business Day prior to the Effective Date of (A) a Notice of Borrowing and (B) an executed Eurodollar Rate indemnification letter in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent, the initial Borrowing hereunder may be a one-month Eurodollar Rate Advance maturing on February 3, 2015, (ii) the Borrower may not select Eurodollar Rate Advances for any Borrowing if the aggregate amount of such
Borrowing is less than $5,000,000 or if the obligation of the Appropriate Lenders to make Eurodollar Rate Advances shall then be suspended pursuant to Sections 2.09 or 2.10 and (iii) the Revolving Credit Advances may not be
outstanding as part of more than five separate Borrowings.  (d) Each Notice of Borrowing and each Notice of Swing Line
Borrowing shall be irrevocable and binding on the Borrower.  (e) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received
written notice from an Appropriate Lender prior to the date of any Borrowing under a Facility under which such Lender has a Commitment that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lenders ratable portion of such
Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such portion available to the Administrative Agent on the date of such 
  29 



Borrowing in accordance with Section 2.02(a) and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. If
and to the extent that such Lender shall not have so made such ratable portion available to the Administrative Agent, such Lender and the Borrower severally agree to repay or pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding
amount and to pay interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to the Borrower until the date such amount is repaid or paid to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate
applicable at such time under Section 2.07 to Advances comprising such Borrowing and (ii) in the case of such Lender, the Federal Funds Rate plus 1/2 of 1%. If such Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent such
corresponding amount, such amount so paid shall constitute such Lenders Advance as part of such Borrowing for all purposes. 
(f) The failure of any Lender to make the Advance to be made by it as part of any Borrowing shall not relieve any other Lender
of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Advance on the date of such Borrowing, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the Advance to be made by such other Lender on the date of any Borrowing. 
SECTION 2.03 Issuance of and Drawings and Reimbursement Under Letters of Credit. 
(a) Request for Issuance. Each Letter of Credit shall be issued upon notice, given not later than 11:00 A.M. on the
tenth Business Day prior to the date of the proposed issuance of such Letter of Credit (or such later day as the Issuing Bank shall agree), by the Borrower to the Issuing Bank, which shall give to the Administrative Agent prompt notice thereof by
telecopier or electronic communication. Each such notice of issuance of a Letter of Credit (a Notice of Issuance) shall be in writing, or by telephone, confirmed promptly in writing, or telecopier or electronic
communication, specifying therein the requested (i) date of such issuance (which shall be a Business Day), (ii) Available Amount of such Letter of Credit (which amount shall not be less than $1,000,000 unless otherwise agreed by the
Issuing Bank and to the Administrative Agent), (iii) expiration date of such Letter of Credit, (iv) name and address of the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit and (v) form of such Letter of Credit, and shall be accompanied by such
application and agreement for letter of credit as the Issuing Bank may specify to the Borrower for use in connection with such requested Letter of Credit (a Letter of Credit Agreement). If (A) the requested form of
such Letter of Credit is acceptable to the Issuing Bank in its sole discretion and (B) it has not received notice of objection to such issuance from the Required Lenders, the Issuing Bank will, upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions set
forth in Article III, make such Letter of Credit available to the Borrower at the Issuing Banks office referred to in Section 9.01 or as otherwise agreed with the Borrower in connection with such issuance. In the event and
to the extent that the provisions of any Letter of Credit Agreement shall conflict with this Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement shall govern. 
(b) Participations in Letters of Credit. Upon the issuance of a Letter of Credit by the Issuing Bank under
Section 2.03(a) or the deemed issuance of the Existing Letters of Credit under Section 2.01(c), the Issuing Bank shall be deemed, without further action by any party hereto, to have sold to each Lender, and each such Lender
shall be deemed, without further action by any party hereto, to have purchased from the Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit in an amount for each Lender equal to such Lenders Pro Rata Share of the Available Amount of such
Letter of Credit, effective upon the issuance of such Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay such Lenders Pro Rata Share of each L/C Disbursement
made by the Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the Borrower forthwith on the date due as provided in 
  30 



Section 2.04(c) (or which has been so reimbursed but must be returned or restored by the Issuing Bank because of the occurrence of an event specified in Section 6.01(f) or
otherwise) by depositing to the Administrative Agents Account for the account of the Issuing Bank, in same day funds, an amount equal to such Lenders Pro Rata Share of such L/C Disbursement. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its
obligation to acquire and pay for participations pursuant to this Section 2.03(b) in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including the occurrence and
continuance of a Default or an Event of Default or the termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any off-set, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. If and to the extent that any Lender shall not have
so made the amount of such L/C Disbursement available to the Administrative Agent, such Lender agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such L/C Disbursement
is due pursuant to Section 2.04(c) until the date such amount is paid to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate for its account or the account of the Issuing Bank, as applicable. If such Lender shall pay to the
Administrative Agent such amount for the account of the Issuing Bank on any Business Day, such amount so paid in respect of principal shall constitute a L/C Credit Extension made by such Lender on such Business Day for purposes of this Agreement,
and the outstanding principal amount of the L/C Credit Extension made by the Issuing Bank shall be reduced by such amount on such Business Day. 
(c) Drawing and Reimbursement. The payment by the Issuing Bank of a draft drawn under any Letter of Credit shall
constitute for all purposes of this Agreement the making by the Issuing Bank of a L/C Credit Extension, which shall be a Base Rate Advance, in the amount of such draft. 
(d) Failure to Make L/C Credit Extensions. The failure of any Lender to make the L/C Credit Extension to be made by it
on the date specified in Section 2.03(b) shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation hereunder to make its L/C Credit Extension on such date, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the L/C
Credit Extension to be made by such other Lender on such date.  (e) Applicability of ISP98. Unless otherwise
expressly agreed by the Issuing Bank and the Borrower when a Letter of Credit is issued, the rules of the International Standby Practices 1998 published by the Institute of International Banking Law & Practice (or such later
version thereof as may be in effect at the time of issuance) shall apply to each Letter of Credit.  SECTION 2.04 Repayment of
Advances.  (a) Revolving Credit Facility. The Borrower shall repay to the Administrative Agent for the ratable
account of the Lenders on the Termination Date in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility the aggregate principal amount of the Revolving Credit Advances (including all Revolving Credit Advances made in connection with participations by the Lenders
in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Advances) then outstanding.  (b) Swing Line Advances. The Borrower shall repay
to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swing Line Bank the outstanding principal amount of each Swing Line Advance on the earlier of (i) the maturity date specified in the applicable Notice of Swing Line Borrowing (which maturity
shall be no later than the seventh Business Day after the requested date of such Borrowing) and (ii) the Termination Date in respect of the Swing Line Facility. 
  31 


(c) L/C Credit Extensions. 
(i) The Borrower shall repay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank on the earlier of (A) demand
and (B) the Termination Date in respect of the Letter of Credit Facility, the outstanding principal amount of each L/C Credit Extension. 
(ii) The obligations of the Borrower (with respect to payment) and the Lenders under this Agreement, any Letter of Credit
Agreement and any other agreement or instrument relating to any Letter of Credit in respect of any Letter of Credit (including all reimbursement obligations payable to the Issuing Bank with respect thereto) shall be unconditional and irrevocable,
and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, such Letter of Credit Agreement and such other agreement or instrument under all circumstances, including, without limitation, any or all of the following circumstances (it
being understood that any such payment by the Borrower is without prejudice to, and does not constitute a waiver of, any rights the Borrower might have or might acquire as a result of the payment by the Issuing Bank of any draft or the reimbursement
by the Borrower thereof):  (A) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Loan Document, any Letter of Credit
Agreement, any Letter of Credit or any other agreement or instrument relating thereto (all of the foregoing being, collectively, the L/C Related Documents); 
(B) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Obligations of the
Borrower in respect of any L/C Related Document or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from all or any of the L/C Related Documents; 
(C) the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or other right that the Borrower may have at any time against any beneficiary
or any transferee of a Letter of Credit (or any Persons for which any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), the Issuing Bank or any other Person, whether in connection with the transactions contemplated by the L/C Related Documents
or any unrelated transaction;  (D) any statement or any other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be
forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; 
(E) payment by the Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft, certificate or other document that
does not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit;  (F) any exchange, release or non-perfection of any
Collateral or other collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from the Guaranties or any other guarantee, for all or any of the Obligations of the Borrower in respect of the L/C Related Documents; or 
(G) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, including, without
limitation, any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Borrower or a guarantor. 
  32

(a) Optional. The Borrower may, upon at least five Business Days written notice to the Administrative Agent,
terminate in whole or reduce in part the unused portions of the Swing Line Facility and the Letter of Credit Facility and the Unused Revolving Credit Commitments; provided, however, that each partial reduction of a
Facility (i) shall be in an aggregate amount of $5,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and (ii) shall be made ratably among the Appropriate Lenders in accordance with their Revolving Credit Commitments. Any such
termination or reduction of the Unused Revolving Credit Commitments shall be permanent.  (b) Mandatory. 
(i) The Letter of Credit Facility shall be permanently reduced from time to time on the date of each reduction in the Revolving
Credit Facility by the amount, if any, by which the amount of the Letter of Credit Facility exceeds the Revolving Credit Facility after giving effect to such reduction of the Revolving Credit Facility. 
(ii) The Swing Line Facility shall be permanently reduced from time to time on the date of each reduction in the Revolving
Credit Facility by the amount, if any, by which the amount of the Swing Line Facility exceeds the Revolving Credit Facility after giving effect to such reduction of the Revolving Credit Facility. 
(iii) The Revolving Credit Commitment shall terminate on the Termination Date. 
SECTION 2.06 Prepayments. 
(a) Optional. The Borrower may, upon at least one Business Days notice in the case of Base Rate Advances and three
Business Days notice in the case of Eurodollar Rate Advances, in each case to the Administrative Agent stating the proposed date and aggregate principal amount of the prepayment, and if such notice is given the Borrower shall, prepay the
outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Advances comprising part of the same Borrowing in whole or ratably in part, together with accrued interest to the date of such prepayment on the aggregate principal amount prepaid;
provided, however, that (i) each partial prepayment shall be in an aggregate principal amount of $5,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and (ii) if any prepayment of a Eurodollar Rate
Advance is made on a date other than the last day of an Interest Period for such Advance, the Borrower shall also pay any amounts owing pursuant to Section 9.03.

of the aggregate principal amount of (1) the Revolving Credit Advances plus (2) the L/C Credit Extensions plus (3) the Swing Line Advances then outstanding plus (4) the aggregate Available Amount of all
Letters of Credit then outstanding exceeds (B) the Revolving Credit Facility on such Business Day. 
  33 


(ii) The Borrower shall, on each Business Day, pay to the Administrative Agent
for deposit in the L/C Collateral Account an amount sufficient to cause the aggregate amount on deposit in the L/C Collateral Account to equal the amount by which the aggregate Available Amount of all Letters of Credit then outstanding exceeds the
Letter of Credit Facility on such Business Day.  (iii) Prepayments of the Revolving Credit Facility made pursuant to
Sections 2.06(b)(i) shall be made without reduction in the Revolving Credit Commitment or the Letter of Credit Commitment and shall be first applied to prepay L/C Credit Extensions then outstanding until such Advances are paid in full,

paid in full. Upon the drawing of any Letter of Credit for which funds are on deposit in the L/C Collateral Account, such funds shall be applied to reimburse the Issuing Bank or the Lenders, as applicable. 
(iv) All prepayments under this Section 2.06(b) shall be made together with accrued interest to the date of such
prepayment on the principal amount prepaid, together with any amounts owing pursuant to Section 2.10(g). If any payment of Eurodollar Rate Advances otherwise required to be made under this Section 2.06(b) would be made on a
day other than the last day of the applicable Interest Period therefor, the Borrower may direct the Administrative Agent to (and if so directed, the Administrative Agent shall) deposit such payment in the Collateral Account until the last day of the
applicable Interest Period at which time the Administrative Agent shall apply the amount of such payment to the prepayment of such Advances; provided, however, that such Advances shall continue to bear interest as set

Sections 2.07(a)(i) or (ii), as applicable, and, in all other cases, on Base Rate Advances pursuant to Section 2.07(a)(i); provided, however, that (x) following the acceleration of the Advances, or the
giving of notice by the Administrative Agent to accelerate the Advances, pursuant to Section 6.01, Default Interest shall accrue and be payable hereunder whether or not previously required by the Administrative Agent and (y) at any
time after the payment of Default Interest has been required, the Required Lenders may, if they so determine, rescind the accrual or payment of any or all Default Interest. 
(c) Notice of Interest Period and Interest Rate. Promptly after receipt of a Notice of Borrowing pursuant to
Section 2.02(a), a notice of Conversion pursuant to Section 2.09 or a notice of selection of an Interest Period pursuant to the terms of the definition of Interest Period, the Administrative Agent shall give notice to the

(ii) If the Borrower shall fail to select the duration of any Interest Period for any Eurodollar Rate Advances in accordance
with the provisions contained in the definition of Interest Period in Section 1.01, the Administrative Agent will forthwith so notify the Borrower and the Appropriate Lenders, whereupon each such Eurodollar Rate Advance will
automatically, on the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into a Base Rate Advance. 
  36 


(iii) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Default,
(A) each Eurodollar Rate Advance will automatically, on the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into a Base Rate Advance and (B) the obligation of the Lenders to make, or to Convert Advances into, Eurodollar

Changed Circumstances; Indemnity.  (a) Increased Costs Generally. If any Change in Law shall: 
(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement

(ii) subject any Lender or the Issuing Bank to any tax of any kind whatsoever on or with respect to this Agreement, any Letter

respect thereof (except for Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes covered by Section 2.12 and the imposition of, or any change in the rate of, any Excluded Tax payable by such Lender or the Issuing Bank); or 
(iii) impose on any Lender or the Issuing Bank or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting

participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of Credit), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or the Issuing Bank
hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon written request of such Lender or the Issuing Bank, the Borrower shall promptly pay to any such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or
amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered. 
(b) Capital Requirements. If any Lender or the Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or
the Issuing Bank or any lending office of such Lender or such Lenders or the Issuing Banks holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such
Lenders or the Issuing Banks capital or on the capital of such Lenders or the Issuing Banks holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Revolving Credit Commitment of such Lender or the Advances made by,
or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the Issuing Bank, below the level that such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lenders or the Issuing Banks holding company could have
achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lenders or the Issuing Banks policies and the policies of such Lenders or the Issuing Banks holding company with respect to capital adequacy and liquidity),
then from time to time upon written request of such Lender or the Issuing Bank the Borrower shall promptly pay to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing
Bank or such Lenders or the Issuing Banks holding company for any such reduction suffered.

Issuing Bank setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section and delivered to the Borrower shall
be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within ten (10) days after receipt thereof. 
(d) Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to
this Section 2.10 shall not constitute a waiver of such Lenders or the Issuing Banks right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or the Issuing Bank
pursuant to this Section 2.10 for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine (9) months prior to the date that such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law
giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lenders or the Issuing Banks intention to claim compensation therefor (except that if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then
the nine-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).  (e)
Circumstances Affecting Eurodollar Rate Availability. In connection with any request for a Eurodollar Rate Advance or a Base Rate Advance as to which the interest rate is determined with reference to the Eurodollar Rate or a Conversion to or
continuation thereof, if for any reason (i) the Administrative Agent shall determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in the London interbank
Eurodollar market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Advance, (ii) the Administrative Agent shall determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that reasonable and adequate means do not
exist for the ascertaining the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Advance or any Base Rate Advance as to which the interest rate is determined with reference to the Eurodollar Rate or (iii) the
Required Lenders shall determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that the Eurodollar Rate does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining such Advances during such
Interest Period, then the Administrative Agent shall promptly give notice thereof to the Borrower. Thereafter, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower that such circumstances no longer exist, the obligation of the Lenders to make
Eurodollar Rate Advances or Base Rate Advances as to which the interest rate is determined with reference to the Eurodollar Rate and the right of the Borrower to Convert any Advance to or continue any Advance as a Eurodollar Rate Advance or a Base
Rate Advance as to which the interest rate is determined with reference to the Eurodollar Rate shall be suspended, and (i) in the case of Eurodollar Rate Advances, the Borrower shall either (A) repay in full (or cause to be repaid in full)
the then outstanding principal amount of each such Eurodollar Rate Advance together with accrued interest thereon (subject to Section 2.11(a)), on the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable to such Eurodollar Rate
Advance; or (B) Convert the then outstanding principal amount of each such Eurodollar Rate Advance to a Base Rate Advance as to which the interest rate is not determined by reference to the Eurodollar Rate as of the last day of such Interest
Period; or (ii) in the case of Base Rate Advances as to which the interest rate is determined by reference to the Eurodollar Rate, the Borrower shall Convert the then outstanding principal amount of each such Advance to a Base Rate Advance as
to which the interest rate is not determined by reference to the Eurodollar Rate as of the last day of such Interest Period. 
  38 


(f) Laws Affecting Eurodollar Rate Availability. If, after the Effective
Date, the introduction of, or any change in, any Applicable Law or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof,
or compliance by any of the Lenders (or any of their Applicable Lending Offices) with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency, shall make it unlawful or
impossible for any of the Lenders (or any of their Applicable Lending Offices) to honor its obligations hereunder to make or maintain any Eurodollar Rate Advance or any Base Rate Advance as to which the interest rate is determined by reference to
the Eurodollar Rate, such Lender shall promptly give notice thereof to the Administrative Agent and the Administrative Agent shall promptly give notice to the Borrower and the other Lenders. Thereafter, until the Administrative Agent notifies the
Borrower that such circumstances no longer exist, (i) the obligations of the Lenders to make Eurodollar Rate Advances or Base Rate Advances as to which the interest rate is determined by reference to the Eurodollar Rate, and the right of the
Borrower to Convert any Advance to a Eurodollar Rate Advance, continue any Advance as a Eurodollar Rate Advance or continue any Advance as a Base Rate Advance as to which the interest rate is determined by reference to the Eurodollar Rate, in each
case, shall be suspended and thereafter the Borrower may select only Base Rate Advances as to which the interest rate is not determined by reference to the Eurodollar Rate hereunder, (ii) all Base Rate Advances shall cease to be determined by
reference to the Eurodollar Rate and (iii) if any of the Lenders may not lawfully continue to maintain a to the Eurodollar Rate Advance to the end of the then current Interest Period applicable thereto, the applicable Advance shall immediately
be Converted to a Base Rate Advance as to which the interest rate is not determined by reference to the Eurodollar Rate for the remainder of such Interest Period. 
(g) Indemnity. The Borrower hereby indemnifies each of the Lenders against any loss or expense (including any loss or
expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain a Eurodollar Rate Advance or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained) which may arise or be attributable to each
Lenders obtaining, liquidating or employing deposits or other funds acquired to effect, fund or maintain any Advance (a) as a consequence of any failure by the Borrower to make any payment when due of any amount due hereunder in
connection with a Eurodollar Rate Advance, (b) due to any failure of the Borrower to borrow, continue or Convert on a date specified therefor in a Notice of Borrowing or notice of Conversion or (c) due to any payment, prepayment or
Conversion of any Eurodollar Rate Advance on a date other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor. The amount of such loss or expense shall be determined, in the applicable Lenders sole discretion, based upon the assumption that such
Lender funded its Pro Rata Share of the Eurodollar Rate Advances in the London interbank market and using any reasonable attribution or averaging methods which such Lender deems appropriate and practical. A certificate of such Lender setting forth
the basis for determining such amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender shall be forwarded to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent and shall be conclusively presumed to be correct save for manifest error. 
SECTION 2.11 Payments and Computations. 
(a) The Borrower shall make each payment hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, irrespective of any right of
counterclaim or set-off (except as otherwise provided in Section 2.15), not later than 11:00 A.M. on the day when due in Dollars to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agents Account in same day funds, with payments
being received by the Administrative Agent after such time being deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day. The Administrative Agent will promptly thereafter cause like funds to

  39 



be distributed (i) if such payment by the Borrower is in respect of principal, interest, commitment fees or any other Obligation then payable hereunder and under the other Loan Documents to
more than one Lender Party, to such Lender Parties for the account of their respective Applicable Lending Offices ratably in accordance with the amounts of such respective Obligations then payable to such Lender Parties and (ii) if such payment
by the Borrower is in respect of any Obligation then payable hereunder to one Lender Party, to such Lender Party for the account of its Applicable Lending Office, in each case to be applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Upon its
acceptance of an Assignment and Acceptance and recording of the information contained therein in the Register pursuant to Section 9.10(c), from and after the effective date of such Assignment and Acceptance, the Administrative Agent
shall make all payments hereunder and under the other Loan Documents in respect of the interest assigned thereby to the Lender Party assignee thereunder, and the parties to such Assignment and Acceptance shall make all appropriate adjustments in
such payments for periods prior to such effective date directly between themselves.  (b) The Borrower hereby authorizes
each Lender Party and each of its Affiliates, if and to the extent payment owed to such Lender Party is not made when due hereunder or under the other Loan Documents to charge from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, against any or
all of the Borrowers accounts with such Lender Party or such Affiliate any amount so due.  (c) All computations of
interest based on the Base Rate when the Base Rate is determined by the Prime Rate shall be made by the Administrative Agent on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and all computations of interest based on the Eurodollar Rate
or the Federal Funds Rate and of fees and Letter of Credit commissions shall be made by the Administrative Agent on the basis of a year of 360 days, in each case for the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day)
occurring in the period for which such interest, fees or commissions are payable. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate, fee or commission hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest
error.  (d) Whenever any payment hereunder or under the other Loan Documents shall be stated tube due on a day other than a
Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest or commitment or letter of credit fee or commission, as the case may
be; provided, however, that, if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of Eurodollar Rate Advances to be made in the next following calendar month, such payment shall be made on the next preceding
Business Day.  (e) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which
any payment is due to any Lender Party hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent on such date and the
Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each such Lender Party on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender Party. If and to the extent the Borrower shall not have so made such
payment in full to the Administrative Agent, each such Lender Party shall repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender Party together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is
distributed to such Lender Party until the date such Lender Party repays such amount to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate. 
  40 


(f) Whenever any payment received by the Administrative Agent under this
Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents, any Secured Hedge Agreement or any Secured Cash Management Agreement is insufficient to pay in full all amounts due and payable to the Agents, the Lender Parties, the Hedge Banks and the Cash Management
Banks under or in respect of this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, the Secured Cash Management Agreement and the Secured Hedge Agreement on any date, such payment shall be distributed by the Administrative Agent and applied by the Agents and the
Lender Parties in the following order of priority:  (i) first, to the payment of that portion of the Secured
Obligations constituting fees, indemnification payments, costs and expenses that are due and payable to the Agents (solely in their respective capacities as Agents) under or in respect of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents on such date,
ratably based upon the respective aggregate amounts of all such fees, indemnification payments, costs and expenses owing to the Agents on such date; 
(ii) second, to the payment of that portion of the Secured Obligations constituting fees, indemnification payments,
costs and expenses that are due and payable to the Issuing Bank and the Swing Line Bank (solely in their respective capacities as such) under or in respect of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents on such date, ratably based upon the
respective aggregate amounts of all such fees, indemnification payments, costs and expenses owing to the Issuing Bank and the Swing Line Bank on such date; 
(iii) third, to the payment of that portion of the Secured Obligations constituting indemnification payments, costs and
expenses that are due and payable to the Lenders under Sections 9.03 hereof, Section 14 of the Pledge Agreement and any similar section of any of the other Loan Documents on such date, ratably based upon the respective aggregate amounts
of all such indemnification payments, costs and expenses owing to the Lenders on such date;  (iv) fourth, to the
payment of that portion of the Secured Obligations constituting amounts that are due and payable to the Administrative Agent and the Lender Parties under Sections 2.10 and 2.12 on such date, ratably based upon the respective aggregate
amounts thereof owing to the Administrative Agent and the Lender Parties on such date;  (v) fifth, to the payment of
that portion of the Secured Obligations constituting fees that are due and payable to the Lenders under Section 2.08(a) on such date, ratably based upon the respective aggregate Commitments of the Lenders under the Facilities on such
date;  (vi) sixth, to the payment of that portion of the Secured Obligations constituting accrued and unpaid
interest on the Advances under or in respect of the Loan Documents that is due and payable to the Administrative Agent and the Lender Parties under Section 2.07(b) on such date, ratably based upon the respective aggregate amounts of all
such interest owing to the Administrative Agent and the Lender Parties on such date; 
  41 


(vii) seventh, to the payment of that portion of the Secured Obligations
constituting accrued and unpaid interest on the Advances that is due and payable to the Administrative Agent and the Lender Parties under Section 2.07(a) on such date, ratably based upon the respective aggregate amounts of all such
interest owing to the Administrative Agent and the Lender Parties on such date;  (viii) eighth, ratably to
(A) the payment of the principal amount of all of the outstanding Advances that is due and payable to the Administrative Agent and the Lender Parties on such date, ratably based upon the respective aggregate amounts of all such principal owing
to the Administrative Agent and the Lender Parties on such date, (B) the payment of all amounts due and payable under each Secured Hedge Agreement and (C) the payment of all amounts due and payable under each Secured Cash Management
Agreement; and  (ix) ninth, to the payment of all other Secured Obligations of the Loan Parties owing under or in
respect of the Loan Documents that are due and payable to the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties on such date, ratably based upon the respective aggregate amounts of all such Secured Obligations owing to the Administrative Agent and
the other Secured Parties on such date.  If the Administrative Agent receives funds for application to the Secured Obligations of the Loan Parties under
or in respect of the Loan Documents under circumstances for which the Loan Documents do not specify the Advances or the Facility to which, or the manner in which, such funds are to be applied, the Administrative Agent may, but shall not be obligated
to, elect to distribute such funds to each of the Lender Parties in accordance with such Lender Partys Pro Rata Share of the sum of (A) the aggregate principal amount of all Advances outstanding at such time and (B) the aggregate
Available Amount of all Letters of Credit outstanding at such time, in repayment or prepayment of such of the outstanding Advances or other Secured Obligations then owing to such Lender Party. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Secured Obligations arising under Secured Cash Management Agreements and Secured Hedge Agreements shall be
excluded from the application described above if the Administrative Agent has not received written notice thereof, together with such supporting documentation as the Administrative Agent may request, from the applicable Cash Management Bank or Hedge
Bank, as the case may be. Each Cash Management Bank or Hedge Bank not a party to this Agreement that has given the notice contemplated by the preceding sentence shall, by such notice, be deemed to have acknowledged and accepted the appointment of
the Administrative Agent pursuant to the terms of Article VII for itself and its Affiliates as if a Lender party hereto. 
SECTION 2.12 Taxes. 
(a) Payment of Taxes. Any and all payments by or on account of any Obligation of the Borrower or any other Loan Party
hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without reduction or withholding for any Indemnified Taxes; provided that if the Administrative Agent, the Borrower or any other Loan Party shall be required by
Applicable Law to deduct any Indemnified Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable by such Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums
payable under this Section 2.12(a)) the Administrative Agent, the applicable Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Loan
Party or the Administrative Agent shall make such deductions and (iii) such Loan Party or the Administrative Agent shall timely pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with Applicable Law. 
  42 


(b) Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower. Without limiting the
provisions of Section 2.12(a), each Loan Party shall timely pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with Applicable Law. 
(c) Indemnification. Each Loan Party shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender and the Issuing Bank, within
ten (10) days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 2.12(c)) paid by the Administrative Agent,
such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant
Governmental Authority; provided that the applicable Loan Party shall not be obligated to indemnify the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Bank for any amount in respect of any such penalties, interest or reasonable expenses if
written demand therefor was not made by the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Bank within 180 days from the date on which such party makes payment for such penalties, interest or expenses; provided further that the foregoing
limitation shall not apply to any such penalties, interest or reasonable expenses arising out of the retroactive application of any such Indemnified Tax or Other Tax. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the
applicable Loan Party by a Lender or the Issuing Bank (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or the Issuing Bank, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Loan
Parties shall also indemnify the Administrative Agent, within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for any amount which a Lender or the Issuing Bank for any reason fails to pay indefeasibly to the Administrative Agent as required by
Section 2.12(g); provided that, such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, shall indemnify the applicable Loan Party to the extent of any payment the applicable Loan Party makes to the Administrative Agent pursuant to
this sentence. In addition, the Loan Parties shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender and the Issuing Bank, within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for any incremental Taxes that may become payable by such Administrative Agent,
Lender (or its beneficial owners) or Issuing Bank as a result of any failure of any Loan Party to pay any Taxes when due to the appropriate Governmental Authority or to deliver to such Administrative Agent, pursuant to Section 2.12(d),
documentation evidencing the payment of Taxes.  (d) Evidence of Payments. As soon as practicable after any payment
of Indemnified Taxes by a Loan Party to a Governmental Authority, the applicable Loan Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy
of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. 
(e) Status of Lenders. Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under
the law of the jurisdiction in which the Borrower is resident for tax purposes, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to
the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by Applicable Law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by Applicable Law as will permit such
payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by Applicable Law or reasonably
requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Without limiting the

  43 



generality of the foregoing, in the event that the Borrower is a resident for tax purposes in the United States, any Foreign Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in
such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent,
but only if such Foreign Lender is legally entitled to do so), whichever of the following is applicable:  (i) duly
completed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, as applicable, claiming eligibility for benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party; 
(ii) duly completed copies of IRS Form W-8ECI; 
(iii) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under section 881(c) of the
Code, (x) a certificate to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not (A) a bank within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (B) a 10 percent shareholder of the Borrower within the meaning of
section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or (C) a controlled foreign corporation described in section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code and (y) duly completed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, as applicable; or 
(iv) any other form prescribed by Applicable Law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in United States Federal
withholding tax duly completed together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by Applicable Law to permit the Borrower to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made. 
If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to United States Federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such
Lender fails to comply with any requirements of FATCA (including those contained in sections 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by
Applicable Law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by Applicable Law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional
documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such
Lenders obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this paragraph, FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. To the
extent that the relevant documentation provided pursuant to this Section 2.12(e) is rendered obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, each Lender shall update such documentation or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent
in writing of its legal inability to do so.  (f) Treatment of Certain Refunds. If the Administrative Agent, a Lender
or the Issuing Bank determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 2.12 (including additional amounts paid by a Loan Party
pursuant to this Section 2.12), it shall pay to the applicable indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, under this Section 2.12 with
respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, and without interest (other than any interest

  44 



paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); provided that the applicable indemnifying party, upon the request of the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the
Issuing Bank, agrees to repay the amount paid over pursuant to this Section 2.12 (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Bank
in the event the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Bank is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.12(f), in no event will the Administrative
Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this Section 2.12(f) the payment of which would place the Administrative Agent, Issuing Bank or Lender in a less favorable net
after-Tax position than the Administrative Agent, Issuing Bank or Lender would have been in if the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid. This Section 2.12(f) shall not be construed
to require the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Bank to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person. 
(g) Indemnification of the Administrative Agent. Each Lender and the Issuing Bank shall indemnify the Administrative
Agent within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Taxes attributable to such Lender or Issuing Bank that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent, and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect
thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be
conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender and the Issuing Bank hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, under any Loan Document
against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this Section 2.12(g). The agreements in Section 2.12(g) shall survive the resignation and/or replacement of the Administrative Agent 
(h) Survival. Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of the Borrower hereunder, the agreements and
obligations of the Borrower contained in this Section 2.12 shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of the Revolving Credit Commitment. 
SECTION 2.13 Sharing of Payments, Etc. If any Lender Party shall obtain at any time any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary,
through the exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise, other than as a result of an assignment pursuant to Section 9.10) (a) on account of Obligations due and payable to such Lender Party hereunder and under the Notes and the
other Loan Documents at such time in excess of its ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Obligations due and payable to such Lender Party at such time to (ii) the aggregate amount of the Obligations due and
payable to all Lender Parties hereunder and under the Notes and the other Loan Documents at such time) of payments on account of the Obligations due and payable to all Lender Parties hereunder and under the Notes at such time obtained by all the
Lender Parties at such time or (b) on account of Obligations owing (but not due and payable) to such Lender Party hereunder and under the Notes and the other Loan Documents at such time in excess of its ratable share (according to the
proportion of (i) the amount of such Obligations owing to such Lender Party at such time to (ii) the aggregate amount of the Obligations owing (but not due and payable) to all Lender Parties hereunder and under the Notes and the other Loan
Documents at such time) of payments on account of the Obligations owing (but not due and payable) to all Lender Parties hereunder and under the Notes at such time obtained by all of the Lender Parties at such time, such Lender Party shall forthwith
purchase from the other Lender Parties such interests or participating interests in the Obligations due and payable or owing to them, as the case may be, as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing 
  45 


Lender Party to share the excess payment ratably with each of them; provided,
however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender Party, such purchase from each other Lender Party shall be rescinded and such other Lender Party shall repay to the purchasing
Lender Party the purchase price to the extent of such Lender Partys ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the purchase price paid to such Lender Party to (ii) the aggregate purchase price paid to all Lender Parties) of
such recovery together with an amount equal to such Lender Partys ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such other Lender Partys required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the
purchasing Lender Party) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender Party in respect of the total amount so recovered; provided further that, so long as the Obligations under the Loan Documents shall not have
been accelerated, any excess payment received by any Appropriate Lender shall be shared on a pro rata basis only with other Appropriate Lenders. The Borrower agrees that any Lender Party so purchasing an interest or participating interest from
another Lender Party pursuant to this Section 2.13 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off) with respect to such interest or participating interest, as the case may
be, as fully as if such Lender Party were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such interest or participating interest, as the case may be. 
SECTION 2.14 Use of Proceeds. The proceeds of the Revolving Credit Advances and the Swing Line Advances and the issuance of the Letters
of Credit shall be used for the account of the Borrower to provide a portion of the refinancing of certain existing Debt of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (including, without limitation, the Existing Credit Agreement) (the
Refinancing), ongoing working capital and for other general corporate purposes of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries. 
SECTION 2.15 Defaulting Lenders. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a
Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as such Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law: 
(a) Waivers and Amendments. Such Defaulting Lenders right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or
consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in Section 9.02.  (b) Reallocation
of Payments. Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, or otherwise, and including any amounts made
available to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 9.04), shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows: first, to the payment
of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder; second, to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Issuing Bank and/or the Swing Line Bank hereunder;
third, if so determined by the Administrative Agent or requested by the Issuing Bank and/or the Swing Line Bank, to be held as cash collateral for future funding obligations of such Defaulting Lender of any participation in any Swing Line
Advance or Letter of Credit; fourth, as the Borrower may request (so long as no Default or Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Borrowing in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required
by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent; fifth, if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to be held in a non-interest bearing deposit account and released in order to satisfy obligations of such
Defaulting Lender to fund Advances under this Agreement; sixth, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Administrative Agent, the 
  46 



Lenders, the Issuing Bank or Swing Line Bank as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Administrative Agent, any Lender, the Issuing Bank or Swing Line Bank
against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement; seventh, so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a
result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and eighth, to such Defaulting
Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if (i) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Revolving Credit Advance or funded participations in Swing Line Advances or Letters of
Credit in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share and (ii) such Revolving Credit Advance or funded participations in Swing Line Advances or Letters of Credit were made at a time when the conditions set
forth in Section 3.02 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Revolving Credit Advances of, and funded participations in Swing Line Advances or Letters of Credit owed to, all Non-Defaulting Lenders on a
pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Revolving Credit Advances of, or funded participations in Swing Line Advances or Letters of Credit owed to, such Defaulting Lender. Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or
payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post cash collateral pursuant to this Section 2.15(b) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each
Lender irrevocably consents hereto.  (c) Reallocation of Applicable Percentages to Reduce Fronting Exposure. During
any period in which there is a Defaulting Lender, for purposes of computing the amount of the obligation of each Non-Defaulting Lender to acquire, refinance or fund participations in Letters of Credit or Swing Line Advances pursuant to Sections
2.02(b) and 2.03(b), the Pro Rata Share of each Non-Defaulting Lender shall be computed without giving effect to the Revolving Credit Commitment of such Defaulting Lender; provided that (i) each such reallocation shall be
given effect only if, at the date the applicable Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, no Default or Event of Default exists and (ii) the aggregate obligation of each Non-Defaulting Lender to acquire, refinance or fund participations in Letters
of Credit and Swing Line Advances shall not exceed the positive difference, if any, of (A) the Revolving Credit Commitment of that Non-Defaulting Lender minus (B) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Revolving Credit
Advances of such Lender.  (d) Cash Collateral for Letters of Credit. Promptly on demand by the Issuing Bank or the
Administrative Agent from time to time, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent cash collateral in an amount sufficient to cover all Fronting Exposure with respect to the Issuing Bank (after giving effect to
Section 2.15(c)) on terms reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank (and such cash collateral shall be in Dollars). Any such cash collateral shall be deposited in a separate account with the Administrative
Agent, subject to the exclusive dominion and control of the Administrative Agent, as collateral (solely for the benefit of the Issuing Bank) for the payment and performance of each Defaulting Lenders Pro Rata Share of outstanding L/C Credit
Extensions. Moneys in such account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the Issuing Bank immediately for each Defaulting Lenders Pro Rata Share of any drawing under any Letter of Credit which has not otherwise been
reimbursed by the Borrower or such Defaulting Lender.  (e) Prepayment of Swing Line Advances. Promptly on demand by
the Swing Line Bank or the Administrative Agent from time to time, the Borrower shall prepay Swing Line Advances in an amount of all Fronting Exposure with respect to the Swing Line Bank (after giving effect to Section 2.15(c)). 
  47 


(f) Certain Fees. For any period during which such Lender is a Defaulting
Lender, such Defaulting Lender (i) shall not be entitled to receive any Revolving Credit Commitment Fee pursuant to Section 2.08(a) (and the Borrower shall not be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have been required
to have been paid to such Defaulting Lender) and (ii) shall not be entitled to receive any letter of credit commissions pursuant to Section 2.08(b) otherwise payable to the account of a Defaulting Lender with respect to any Letter
of Credit as to which such Defaulting Lender has not provided cash collateral or other credit support arrangements satisfactory to the Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.15(d), but instead, the Borrower shall pay to the Non-Defaulting
Lenders the amount of such letter of credit commissions in accordance with the upward adjustments in their respective Pro Rata Shares allocable to such Letter of Credit pursuant to Section 2.15(c), with the balance of such fee, if any,
payable to the Issuing Bank for its own account.  (g) Defaulting Lender Cure. If the Borrower, the Administrative
Agent, the Swing Line Bank and the Issuing Bank agree in writing in their sole discretion that a Defaulting Lender should no longer be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the
date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any cash collateral), such Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase that portion of outstanding Revolving Credit
Advances of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Revolving Credit Advances and funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Advances to be held
on a pro rata basis by the Lenders in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares of the Revolving Credit Commitment (without giving effect to Section 2.15(c)), whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that
no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while such Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly
agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from such Lenders having been a Defaulting Lender. 
SECTION 2.16 Evidence of Debt. 
(a) Each Lender Party shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness
of the Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Advance owing to such Lender Party from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder. The Borrower agrees that upon
written notice by any Lender Party to the Borrower (with a copy of such notice to the Administrative Agent) to the effect that a promissory note or other evidence of indebtedness is required or appropriate in order for such Lender Party to evidence
(whether for purposes of pledge, enforcement or otherwise) the Advances owing to, or to be made by, such Lender Party, the Borrower shall promptly execute and deliver to such Lender Party, with a copy to the Administrative Agent, a Note, in
substantially the form of Exhibit A hereto, respectively, payable to the order of such Lender Party in a principal amount equal to the Revolving Credit Commitment of such Lender Party. All references to Notes in the Loan Documents shall mean
Notes, if any, to the extent issued hereunder. 
  48 


(b) The Register maintained by the Administrative Agent pursuant to
Section 9.10(c) shall include a control account, and a subsidiary account for each Lender Party, in which accounts (taken together) shall be recorded (i) the date and amount of each Borrowing made hereunder, the Type of Advances
comprising such Borrowing and, if appropriate, the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the terms of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to and accepted by it, (iii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to
become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender Party hereunder, and (iv) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent from the Borrower hereunder and each Lender Partys share thereof. 
(c) Entries made in good faith by the Administrative Agent in the Register pursuant to Section 2.16(b), and by each
Lender Party in its account or accounts pursuant to Section 2.16(a), shall be prima facie evidence of the amount of principal and interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to, in the case of the
Register, each Lender Party and, in the case of such account or accounts, such Lender Party, under this Agreement, absent manifest error; provided, however, that the failure of the Administrative Agent or such Lender Party to make an
entry, or any finding that an entry is incorrect, in the Register or such account or accounts shall not limit or otherwise affect the Obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement. 
SECTION 2.17 Replacement of Lenders. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.10, or if the Borrower is required
to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.12, or if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender hereunder or becomes a Non-Consenting Lender, then the Borrower may,
at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by,
Section 9.10), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such
assignment); provided that:  (a) the Borrower shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the assignment fee
specified in Section 9.10;  (b) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding
principal of its Advances and participations in Letters of Credit, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under Section 2.10) from
the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts); 
(c) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.10 or payments
required to be made pursuant to Section 2.12, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter; and 
(d) such assignment does not conflict with Applicable Law. 
A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or
otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.  SECTION 2.18 Increase to
Revolving Credit Commitments. The Borrower may, at any time and from time to time, upon prior written notice by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent increase the aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments (but not the Letter of Credit Commitment
or Swing Line Commitment) by a maximum aggregate amount of up to THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ($300,000,000) with additional Revolving Credit Commitments from any existing Lender with a Revolving Credit Commitment or new Revolving Credit
Commitments from any other Person selected by the Borrower and acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank; provided that: 
(A) any such increase shall be in a minimum principal amount of $25,000,000 and in integral multiples of $5,000,000 in excess
thereof; 
  49 


(B) no Default or Event of Default shall exist and be continuing at the time of
any such increase;  (C) no existing Lender shall be under any obligation to increase its Revolving Credit Commitment and
any such decision whether to increase its Revolving Credit Commitment shall be in such Lenders sole and absolute discretion; 
(D) (1) any new Lender shall join this Agreement by executing such joinder documents required by the Administrative Agent
and/or (2) any existing Lender electing to increase its Revolving Credit Commitment shall have executed a commitment agreement satisfactory to the Administrative Agent; 
(E) as a condition precedent to such increase, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a certificate of each
Credit Party dated as of the date of such increase (in sufficient copies for each Lender) signed by a Responsible Officer of such Credit Party (1) certifying and attaching the resolutions adopted by such Credit Party approving or consenting to
such increase, and (2) in the case of the Borrower, (y) certifying that, before and after giving effect to such increase, (i) the representations and warranties contained in each Loan Document are true and correct in all material
respects on and as of the date of such increase, as though made on and as of such date, other than any such representations or warranties that, by their express terms, refer to a specific date other than the date of such increase, in which case as
of such specific date, and (ii) no Default or Event of Default exists and (z) including a pro forma compliance certificate demonstrating that the Borrower shall be in pro forma compliance with the financial covenants set forth in
Section 5.04 after giving effect to the incurrence of any Advances made on the date of increase; and  (F) The
Lender Addendum of any existing Lender increasing its Revolving Credit Commitment shall be updated to include such increase pursuant to this Section 2.18 and any Person that becomes a Lender pursuant to this Section 2.18
shall provide a Lender Addendum to the Administrative Agent.  The Borrower shall prepay any Revolving Credit Loans owing by it and
outstanding on the date of any such increase (and pay any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 2.10) to the extent necessary to keep the outstanding Revolving Credit Loans ratable with any revised Revolving Credit Commitments
arising from any nonratable increase in the Revolving Credit Commitments under this Section.

returns required by Applicable Law to be filed, and has paid, or made adequate provision for the payment of, all federal, state, local and other taxes, assessments and governmental charges or levies upon it and its property, income, profits and
assets which are due and payable (other than any amount the validity of which is currently being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and with respect to which reserves in conformity with GAAP have been provided for on the books of the
relevant Loan Party). Such returns accurately reflect in all material respects all liability for taxes of any Loan Party or any Subsidiary thereof for the periods covered thereby. Each Loan Party and each Subsidiary thereof may be subject to audits
and examinations by federal, state and local Governmental Authorities from time to time in the ordinary course of business; provided, however, there is no material ongoing audit or examination or, to the knowledge of the Borrower,
other investigation by any Governmental Authority of the tax liability of any Loan Party or any Subsidiary thereof. No Governmental Authority has asserted any Lien or other claim against any Loan Party or any Subsidiary thereof with respect to
unpaid taxes which has not been discharged or resolved (other than (A) any amount the validity of which is currently being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and with respect to which reserves in conformity with GAAP have been
provided for on the books of the relevant Loan Party and (B) Liens permitted pursuant to Section 5.02(a)). The charges, accruals and reserves on the books of each Loan Party and each Subsidiary thereof in respect of federal, state,
local and other taxes for all Fiscal Years and portions thereof since the organization of any Loan Party or any Subsidiary thereof are in the judgment of the Borrower adequate, and the Borrower does not anticipate any additional taxes or assessments
for any of such years.

Bankruptcy Code, (x) the Commitments of each Lender Party and the obligation of each Lender Party to make Advances (other than L/C Credit Extensions by the Issuing Bank or a Lender pursuant to Section 2.03(b)) and of the Issuing
Bank to issue Letters of Credit shall automatically be terminated and (y) the Advances, all such interest and all such amounts shall automatically become and be due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or any notice of any kind,
all of which are hereby expressly waived by the Borrower.  SECTION 6.02 Actions in Respect of the Letters of Credit upon Default.
If any Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Administrative Agent may, or shall at the request of the Required Lenders, irrespective of whether it is taking any of the actions described in Section 6.01 or otherwise,
make demand upon the Borrower to, and forthwith upon such demand the Borrower will, pay to the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lender Parties in same day funds at the Administrative Agents Office, for deposit in the L/C Collateral
Account, an amount equal to the aggregate Available Amount of all Letters of Credit then outstanding; provided, however, that in the event of an actual or deemed entry of an order for relief with respect to the Borrower under the
Federal Bankruptcy Code, the Borrower shall be obligated to pay to the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lender Parties in same day funds at the Administrative Agents Office, for deposit in the L/C Collateral Account, an amount equal to
the aggregate Available Amount of all Letters of Credit then outstanding, without presentment, 
  80 



demand, protest or any notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the Borrower. If at any time the Administrative Agent or the Administrative Agent determines that any funds
held in the L/C Collateral Account are subject to any right or claim of any Person other than the Agents and the Lender Parties or that the total amount of such funds is less than the aggregate Available Amount of all Letters of Credit, the Borrower
will, forthwith upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay to the Administrative Agent, as additional funds to be deposited and held in the L/C Collateral Account, an amount equal to the excess of (a) such aggregate Available Amount over
(b) the total amount of funds, if any, then held in the L/C Collateral Account that the Administrative Agent determines to be free and clear of any such right and claim. Upon the drawing of any Letter of Credit for which funds are on deposit in
the L/C Collateral Account, such funds shall be applied to reimburse the Issuing Bank or Lenders, as applicable, to the extent permitted by applicable law. 
ARTICLE VII  THE AGENTS
 SECTION 7.01 Appointment and Authority. Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank hereby irrevocably designates and appoints
Wells Fargo to act on its behalf as the Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative
Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The provisions of this Article VII are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Issuing Bank, and
neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary thereof shall have rights as a third party beneficiary of any of such provisions. The Administrative Agent shall also act as the collateral agent under the Loan Documents, and each of the
Lenders (including in its capacity as a potential Hedge Bank or Cash Management Bank) and the Issuing Bank hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent to act as the agent of such Lender and the Issuing Bank for purposes of
acquiring, holding and enforcing any and all Liens on Collateral granted by any of the Loan Parties to secure any of the Secured Obligations, together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto (including, without
limitation, to enter into additional Loan Documents or supplements to existing Loan Documents on behalf of the Secured Parties). In this connection, the Administrative Agent, as collateral agent and any co-agents, sub-agents and
attorneys-in-fact appointed by the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Article VII for purposes of holding or enforcing any Lien on the Collateral (or any portion thereof) granted under the Collateral Documents, or for exercising any rights
and remedies thereunder at the direction of the Administrative Agent), shall be entitled to the benefits of all provisions of this Article VII and Article IX (including Section 9.03, as though such co-agents, sub-agents and
attorneys-in-fact were the collateral agent under the Loan Documents) as if set forth in full herein with respect thereto. 
SECTION 7.02 Rights as a Lender. The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its
capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent and the term Lender or Lenders shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise
requires, include the Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and
generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders. 
  81 


SECTION 7.03 Exculpatory Provisions. The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or
obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent: 
(a) shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is
continuing;  (b) shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except
discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as
shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents), provided that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent to
liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or Applicable Law; and  (c) shall not, except as expressly set forth
herein and in the other Loan Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as
the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.  The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it
(i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as
provided in Section 9.02 and Section 6.02) or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final nonappealable judgment. The Administrative
Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until notice describing such Default is given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower, a Lender or the Issuing Bank. 
The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in
or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance
of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any
other agreement, instrument or document or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article III or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent. 
SECTION 7.04 Reliance by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any
liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and
to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any
liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of an Advance, or the issuance of a Letter of Credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or the Issuing Bank, the
Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender or the Issuing Bank unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender or the Issuing Bank prior to the making of such
Advance or the issuance of such Letter of Credit. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken
or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts. 
  82 


SECTION 7.05 Delegation of Duties. The Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its
duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub agent may perform any and all of its
duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub agent, and
shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the Facility as well as activities as Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any sub-agents except
to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and nonappealable judgment that the Administrative Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such
sub-agents.  SECTION 7.06 Resignation of Administrative Agent. 
(a) The Administrative Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders, the Issuing Bank and the Borrower.
Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the Borrower and subject to the consent of the Borrower (provided no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of such
resignation), to appoint a successor, which shall be a bank with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and
shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank, appoint a successor Administrative
Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above provided that if the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that no qualifying Person has accepted such appointment, then such resignation shall nonetheless become effective in
accordance with such notice and (i) the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (except that in the case of any collateral security held by the
Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank under any of the Loan Documents, the retiring Administrative Agent shall continue to hold such collateral security until such time as a successor Administrative Agent is appointed)
and (ii) all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender and the Issuing Bank directly, until such time as the Required Lenders appoint a
successor Administrative Agent as provided for above in this Section 7.06(a). Upon the acceptance of a successors appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the
rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or retired) Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (if not already
discharged therefrom as provided above in this Section 7.06(a)). The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and
such successor. After the retiring Administrative Agents resignation hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article VII and Section 9.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring
Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring Administrative Agent was acting as Administrative Agent. 
(b) Any resignation by Wells Fargo as Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 7.06 shall also constitute its
resignation as Issuing Bank and Swing Line Bank. Upon the acceptance of a successors appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, (a) such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and
duties of the 
  83 



retiring Issuing Bank and Swing Line Bank, (b) the retiring Issuing Bank and Swing Line Bank shall be discharged from all of their respective duties and obligations hereunder or under the
other Loan Documents, and (c) the successor Issuing Bank shall issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession or make other arrangement satisfactory to the retiring Issuing
Bank to effectively assume the obligations of the retiring Issuing Bank with respect to such Letters of Credit.  SECTION 7.07
Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Lenders. Each Lender and the Issuing Bank acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based
on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender and the Issuing Bank also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based
upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.  SECTION 7.08
No Other Duties, etc. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none of the syndication agents, documentation agents, co-agents, bookrunners, arrangers, lead arrangers or co-arrangers listed on the cover page hereof shall have any
powers, duties or responsibilities under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, except in its capacity, as applicable, as the Administrative Agent, a Lender or the Issuing Bank hereunder. 
SECTION 7.09 Collateral and Guaranty Matters. Each of the Lenders (including in its or any of its Affiliates capacities as a
potential Hedge Bank or Cash Management Bank) irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent, at its option and in its discretion: 
(a) to release any Lien on any Collateral granted to or held by the Administrative Agent, for the ratable benefit of the
Secured Parties, under any Loan Document (i) upon the termination of the Revolving Credit Commitment and payment in full of all Secured Obligations (other than (A) contingent indemnification obligations and (B) obligations and
liabilities under Secured Cash Management Agreements or Secured Hedge Agreements as to which arrangements satisfactory to the applicable Cash Management Bank or Hedge Bank shall have been made) and the expiration or termination of all Letters of
Credit, (ii) that is sold or to be sold as part of or in connection with any sale permitted hereunder or under any other Loan Document, or (iii) if approved, authorized or ratified in writing in accordance with Section 9.02;
 (b) to release any Guarantor from its Obligations under any Loan Documents if such Person ceases to be a Subsidiary as a
result of a transaction permitted hereunder; and  (c) to subordinate or release any Lien on any Collateral granted to or
held by the Administrative Agent under any Loan Document to the holder of any Lien permitted pursuant to Sections 5.02(a)(iv), (v) or (vi). 
Upon request by the Administrative Agent at any time, the Required Lenders will confirm in writing the Administrative Agents authority to release or
subordinate its interest in particular types or items of property, or to release any Guarantor from its Obligations under the Guaranty pursuant to this Section 7.09. In each case as specified in this Section 7.09, the
Administrative Agent will, at the Borrowers expense, execute and deliver to the applicable Loan Party such documents as such Loan Party may reasonably request to evidence the release of such item of Collateral from the assignment and security
interest granted under the Collateral Documents or to subordinate its interest in such item, or to release 
  84 



such Guarantor from its Obligations under the Guaranty, in each case in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents and this Section 7.09. In the case of any such sale, transfer
or disposal of any property constituting Collateral in a transaction permitted pursuant to Section 5.02(e), the Liens created by any of the Collateral Documents on such property shall be automatically released without need for further
action by any person.  SECTION 7.10 Secured Hedge Agreements and Secured Cash Management Agreements. No Cash Management Bank or
Hedge Bank that obtains the benefits of Section 2.11(f) or any Collateral by virtue of the provisions hereof or of any Collateral Document shall have any right to notice of any action or to consent to, direct or object to any action
hereunder or under any other Loan Document or otherwise in respect of the Collateral (including the release or impairment of any Collateral) other than in its capacity as a Lender and, in such case, only to the extent expressly provided in the Loan
Documents. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article VII to the contrary, the Administrative Agent shall not be required to verify the payment of, or that other satisfactory arrangements have been made with respect to, Secured Cash
Management Agreements and Secured Hedge Agreements unless the Administrative Agent has received written notice of such Secured Cash Management Agreements and Secured Hedge Agreements, together with such supporting documentation as the Administrative
Agent may request, from the applicable Cash Management Bank or Hedge Bank, as the case may be.  ARTICLE VIII 
GUARANTY  SECTION 8.01
Guaranty; Limitation of Liability.  (a) Each Guarantor jointly and severally, hereby absolutely, unconditionally and
irrevocably guarantees the punctual payment when due, whether at scheduled maturity or on any date of a required prepayment or by acceleration, demand or otherwise, of all Secured Obligations of each other Loan Party now or hereafter existing
(including, without limitation, any extensions, modifications, substitutions, amendments or renewals of any or all of the Secured Obligations) whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, and whether for principal, reimbursement obligations,
interest (including Post Petition Interest), premiums, fees, indemnities, contract causes of action, costs, expenses or otherwise (all of the foregoing being hereafter collectively referred to as the Guaranteed
Obligations), and agrees to pay any and all expenses (including, without limitation, fees and expenses of counsel) incurred by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party in enforcing any rights under this Guaranty or any other
Loan Document or any Secured Hedge Agreement or Secured Cash Management Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Guarantors liability shall extend to all amounts that constitute part of the Guaranteed Obligations and
would be owed by any other Loan Party to any Secured Party under or in respect of the Loan Documents, the Secured Cash Management Agreements or the Secured Hedge Agreements but for the fact that they are unenforceable or not allowable due to the
existence of a bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding involving such other Loan Party.  (b) Each Guarantor, and
by its acceptance of this Guaranty, the Administrative Agent and each other Secured Party, hereby confirms that it is the intention of all such Persons that this Guaranty and the Obligations of each Guarantor hereunder not constitute a fraudulent
transfer or conveyance for purposes of Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar foreign, federal or state law to the extent applicable to this Guaranty and the Obligations of each
Guarantor hereunder. To effectuate the foregoing intention, the Administrative Agent, the other Secured Parties and the Guarantors 
  85 



hereby irrevocably agree that the Obligations of each Guarantor under this Guaranty at any time shall be limited to the maximum amount as will result in the Obligations of such Guarantor under
this Guaranty not constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance (after taking into account the provisions of Section 8.01(c)). 
(c) Each Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably agrees that in the event any payment shall be required to be made to
any Secured Party under this Guaranty or any other guaranty, such Guarantor will contribute, to the maximum extent permitted by law, such amounts to each other Guarantor and each other guarantor so as to maximize the aggregate amount paid to the
Secured Parties under or in respect of the Loan Documents. This Guaranty constitutes a guaranty of payment and performance when due and not merely a guaranty of collection, and each Guarantor specifically agrees that it shall not be necessary or
required that any Secured Party exercise any right, assert any claim or demand or enforce any remedy whatsoever against any Loan Party or any other Person before or as a condition to the obligations of such Guarantor hereunder. 
SECTION 8.02 Guaranty Absolute. Each Guarantor guarantees that the Guaranteed Obligations will be paid strictly in accordance with the
terms of the Loan Documents, regardless of any law, regulation or order now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction affecting any of such terms or the rights of any Secured Party with respect thereto. The Obligations of each Guarantor under or in
respect of this Guaranty are independent of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other Obligations of any other Loan Party under or in respect of the Loan Documents, any Secured Hedge Agreement or any Secured Cash Management Agreement and a separate
action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against each Guarantor to enforce this Guaranty, irrespective of whether any action is brought against the Borrower or any other Loan Party or whether the Borrower or any other Loan Party is joined in
any such action or actions. The liability of each Guarantor under this Guaranty shall be irrevocable, absolute and unconditional irrespective of, and each Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any defenses it may now have or hereafter acquire in any
way relating to, any or all of the following:  (a) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Loan Document, any Secured
Hedge Agreement, any Secured Cash Management Agreement or any other agreement, document or instrument to which the Borrower, any Guarantor or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates is or may become a party; 
(b) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations or
any other Obligations of any other Loan Party under or in respect of the Loan Documents, any Secured Hedge Agreement or any Secured Cash Management Agreement or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from any Loan Document, any
Secured Hedge Agreement or any Secured Cash Management Agreement, including, without limitation, any increase in the Guaranteed Obligations resulting from the extension of additional credit to any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise;
 (c) any taking, exchange, release or non-perfection of any Collateral or any other collateral, or any taking, release or
amendment or waiver of, or consent to departure from, any other guaranty, for all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations; 
(d) any manner of application of Collateral or any other collateral, or proceeds thereof, to allow any of the Guaranteed
Obligations, or any manner of sale or other disposition of any Collateral or any other collateral for all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other Obligations of any Loan Party under the Loan Documents or any other assets of any Loan Party
or any of its Subsidiaries; 
  86 


(e) any change, restructuring or termination of the corporate structure or
existence of any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries;  (f) any failure of any Secured Party to disclose to any Loan Party
any information relating to the business, condition (financial or otherwise), operations, performance, properties or prospects of any other Loan Party now or hereafter known to such Secured Party (each Guarantor waiving any duty on the part of the
Secured Parties to disclose such information);  (g) the failure of any other Person to execute or deliver this Guaranty,
any Guaranty Supplement or any other guaranty or agreement or the release or reduction of liability of any Guarantor or other guarantor or surety with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations; or 
(h) any other circumstance (including, without limitation, any statute of limitations) or any existence of or reliance on any
representation by any Secured Party that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, any Loan Party or any other guarantor or surety. 
This Guaranty shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is
rescinded or must otherwise be returned by any Secured Party or any other Person upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Borrower or any other Loan Party or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made. 
SECTION 8.03 Waivers and Acknowledgments. 
(a) Each Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives promptness, diligence, notice of acceptance, presentment,
demand for performance, notice of nonperformance, default, acceleration, protest or dishonor and any other notice with respect to any of the Guaranteed Obligations and this Guaranty and any requirement that any Secured Party protect, secure, perfect
or insure any Lien or any property subject thereto or exhaust any right or take any action against any Loan Party or any other Person or any Collateral. 
(b) Each Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives any right to revoke this Guaranty and acknowledges that this
Guaranty is continuing in nature and applies to all Guaranteed Obligations, whether existing now or in the future.  (c)
Each Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives (i) any defense arising by reason of any claim or defense based upon an election of remedies by any Secured Party that in any manner impairs, reduces, releases or otherwise adversely
affects the subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution or indemnification rights of such Guarantor or other rights of such Guarantor to proceed against any of the other Loan Parties, any other guarantor or any other Person or any
Collateral and (ii) any defense based on any right of set-off or counterclaim against or in respect of the Obligations of such Guarantor hereunder. 
(d) Each Guarantor acknowledges that the Collateral Agent may, without notice to or demand upon such Guarantor and without
affecting the liability of such Guarantor under this Guaranty, foreclose under any mortgage by nonjudicial sale, and each Guarantor hereby waives any defense to the recovery by the Collateral Agent and the other Secured Parties against such
Guarantor of any deficiency after such nonjudicial sale and any defense or benefits that may be afforded by applicable law. 
  87 


(e) Each Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives any duty on the
part of any Secured Party to disclose to such Guarantor any matter, fact or thing relating to the business, condition (financial or otherwise), operations, performance, properties or prospects of any other Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries now
or hereafter known by such Secured Party.  (f) Each Guarantor acknowledges that it will receive substantial direct and
indirect benefits from the financing arrangements contemplated by the Loan Documents, the Secured Hedge Agreements and the Secured Cash Management Agreements and that the waivers set forth in Section 8.02 and this
Section 8.03 are knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits.  SECTION 8.04 Payments Free and Clear of Taxes, Etc.
Any and all payments made by any Guarantor under or in respect of this Guaranty or any other Loan Document shall be made, in accordance with Section 2.12, free and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future Taxes
and subject to the limitations set forth herein.  SECTION 8.05 Continuing Guaranty; Assignments. This Guaranty is a continuing
guaranty and shall (a) remain in full force and effect until the latest of (i) the payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty, (ii) the Termination Date for all of the Facilities
and (iii) the latest date of expiration or termination of all Letters of Credit, (b) be binding upon each Guarantor, its successors and assigns and (c) inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Lender Parties, the
Administrative Agent and their successors, transferees and assigns. Without limiting the generality of the preceding clause (c), any Lender Party may assign or otherwise transfer all or any portion of its rights and obligations hereunder (including,
without limitation, all or any portion of its Commitment, the Advances owing to it and the Note or Notes held by it) to any other Person, and such other Person shall thereupon become vested with all the benefits in respect thereof granted to such
Lender Party herein or otherwise, in each case as provided in Section 9.10. No Guarantor shall have the right to assign its rights hereunder or any interest herein without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent. 
SECTION 8.06 Subrogation. Each Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably agrees not to exercise any rights that it may now have
or hereafter acquire against the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other insider guarantor that arise from the existence, payment, performance or enforcement of such Guarantors Obligations under or in respect of this Guaranty or any other
Loan Document, including, without limitation, any right of subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution or indemnification and any right to participate in any claim or remedy of any Secured Party against the Borrower, any other Loan Party
or any other insider guarantor or any Collateral, whether or not such claim, remedy or right arises in equity or under contract, statute or common law, including, without limitation, the right to take or receive from the Borrower, any other Loan
Party or any other insider guarantor, directly or indirectly, in cash or other property or by set-off or in any other manner, payment or security on account of such claim, remedy or right, unless and until all of the Guaranteed Obligations and all
other amounts payable under this Guaranty shall have been paid in full in cash, all Letters of Credit, all Secured Cash Management Agreements and all Secured Hedge Agreements shall have expired or been terminated and the Commitments shall have
expired or been terminated. If any amount shall be paid to any Guarantor in violation of the immediately preceding sentence at any time prior to the latest of (a) the payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts
payable under this Guaranty, (b) the Termination Date of all Facilities and (c) the latest date of expiration or termination of all Letters of Credit, all Secured Cash Management Agreements and all Secured Hedge Agreements, such amount
shall be received and held in trust for the benefit of the Secured Parties, shall be segregated from other property and funds of such Guarantor and shall forthwith be paid or delivered to the Administrative Agent in the same form as so received

interest in the Guaranteed Obligations resulting from such payment made by such Guarantor pursuant to this Guaranty.  SECTION 8.07
Guaranty Supplements. Upon the execution and delivery by any Person of a guaranty supplement in substantially the form of Exhibit D hereto (each, a Guaranty Supplement), (a) such Person shall be referred
to as an Additional Guarantor and shall become and be a Guarantor hereunder, and each reference in this Guaranty to a Guarantor shall also mean and be a reference to such Additional Guarantor, and
(b) each reference to  this Guaranty, hereunder, hereof or words of like import referring to this Guaranty, and each reference in any other Loan Document to the
Guaranty, thereunder, thereof or words of like import referring to this Guaranty, shall mean and be a reference to this Guaranty as supplemented by such Guaranty
Supplement.  SECTION 8.08 Subordination. Each Guarantor hereby subordinates any and all debts, liabilities and other obligations
owed to such Guarantor by each other Loan Party (the Subordinated Obligations) to the Guaranteed Obligations to the extent and in the manner hereinafter set forth below in this Section 8.08: 
(a) Prohibited Payments, Etc. Except after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default (including
the commencement and continuation of any proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law relating to any other Loan Party), each Guarantor may receive regularly scheduled payments from any other Loan Party on account of the Subordinated Obligations. After the
occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default (including the commencement and continuation of any proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law relating to any other Loan Party), however, unless the Required Lenders otherwise agree, no
Guarantor shall demand, accept or take any action to collect any payment on account of the Subordinated Obligations.  (b)
Prior Payment of Guaranteed Obligations. In any proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law relating to any other Loan Party, each Guarantor agrees that the Secured Parties shall be entitled to receive payment in full in cash of all Guaranteed
Obligations (including all interest and expenses accruing after the commencement of a proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law, whether or not constituting an allowed claim in such proceeding (Post Petition Interest)) before
such Guarantor receives payment of any Subordinated Obligations.  (c) Turn-Over. After the occurrence and during the
continuance of any Event of Default(including the commencement and continuation of any proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law relating to any other Loan Party), each Guarantor shall, if the Administrative Agent so requests, collect, enforce and receive
payments on account of the Subordinated Obligations as trustee for the Secured Parties and deliver such payments to the Administrative Agent on account of the Guaranteed Obligations (including all Post Petition Interest), together with any necessary
endorsements or other instruments of transfer, but without reducing or affecting in any manner the liability of such Guarantor under the other provisions of this Guaranty. 
  89 


(d) Administrative Agent Authorization. After the occurrence and during
the continuance of any Event of Default (including the commencement and continuation of any proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law relating to any other Loan Party), the Administrative Agent is authorized and empowered (but without any obligation to so
do), in its discretion, (i) in the name of each Guarantor, to collect and enforce, and to submit claims in respect of, Subordinated Obligations and to apply any amounts received thereon to the Guaranteed Obligations (including any and all Post
Petition Interest), and (ii) to require each Guarantor (A) to collect and enforce, and to submit claims in respect of, Subordinated Obligations and (B) to pay any amounts received on such obligations to the Administrative Agent for
application to the Guaranteed Obligations (including any and all Post Petition Interest).  SECTION 8.09 Keepwell. Each Qualified
ECP Guarantor hereby jointly and severally, absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably undertakes to provide such funds and other support as may be needed from time to time by each Specified Loan Party to honor all of such Specified Loan
Partys obligations under this Guaranty and the other Loan Documents in respect of Swap Obligations (provided, however, that each Qualified ECP Guarantor shall only be liable under this Section for the maximum amount of such
liability that can be hereby incurred without rendering its obligations under this Section or otherwise under this Agreement voidable under Applicable Law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer, and not for any greater amount). The
obligations of each Qualified ECP Guarantor under this Section shall remain in full force and effect until all of the Guaranteed Obligations and all the obligations of the Guarantors shall have been paid in full in cash and the Commitments
terminated. Each Qualified ECP Guarantor intends that this Section constitute, and this Section shall be deemed to constitute, a keepwell, support or other agreement for the benefit of each Specified Loan Party for all purposes of

available to the Issuing Lender and the other Lenders by posting the Borrower Materials on the Platform.  (ii) The Platform
is provided as is and as available. The Agent Parties (as defined below) do not warrant the accuracy or completeness of the Borrower Materials or the adequacy of the Platform, and expressly disclaim liability for errors or
omissions in the Borrower Materials. No warranty of any kind, express, implied or statutory, including, without limitation, any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement of third-party rights or freedom from

Agents transmission of communications through the Internet (including, without limitation, the Platform), except to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by
final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Agent Party; provided that in no event shall any Agent Party have any liability to any Loan Party, any Lender, the Issuing Lender or any
other Person for indirect, special, incidental, consequential or punitive damages, losses or expenses (as opposed to actual damages, losses or expenses).

one individual at or on behalf of such Public Lender to at all times have selected the Private Side Information or similar designation on the content declaration screen of the Platform in order to enable such Public Lender or its

Public Side Information portion of the Platform and that may contain material non-public information with respect to the Borrower or its securities for purposes of United States Federal or state securities Applicable Laws. 
SECTION 9.02 Amendments, Waivers and Consents. No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or the Notes or any other Loan
Document, nor consent to any departure by the Borrower or any other Loan Party therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Required Lenders (or by the Administrative Agent on their behalf upon its
receipt of the consent thereof) and the Borrower or the applicable Loan Party, as the case may be, and acknowledged by the Administrative Agent, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific

prepayment of Advances between the Facilities from the application thereof set forth in the applicable provisions of Section 2.06(b), 2.11(f) or 2.13 respectively, in any manner that materially and adversely affects the

consent shall, unless in writing and signed by the Issuing Bank and the Swing Line Bank, as the case may be, in addition to the Lenders required above to take such action, affect the rights or obligations of the Issuing Bank or the Swing Line Bank,
as the case may be, under this Agreement or any Letter of Credit Application relating to any Letter of Credit issued or to be issued by the Issuing Bank; (ii) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by the
Administrative Agent in addition to the Lenders required above, affect the rights or obligations of, or any fees or other amounts payable to, the Administrative Agent under this Agreement or any other Loan Document; and (iii) the Fee Letters
may be amended, or rights or privileges thereunder waived, in a writing executed only by the respective parties thereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Defaulting Lender shall have any right to approve or disapprove any
amendment, waiver or consent hereunder, except that the Commitment of such Lender may not be increased or extended without the consent of such Lender.

Loan Document, or any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including without limitation, reasonable attorneys and consultants fees, provided that such indemnity

gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee or (y) result from a claim brought by any Loan Party or any Subsidiary thereof against an Indemnitee for material breach in bad faith of such Indemnitees obligations hereunder or
under any other Loan Document, if such Loan Party or such Subsidiary has obtained a final and nonappealable judgment in its favor on such claim as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. 
(c) Reimbursement by Lenders. To the extent that the Borrower for any reason fails to indefeasibly pay any amount
required under Sections 9.03(a) or (b) to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent (or any sub-agent thereof), the Issuing Bank, the Swing Line Bank or any Related Party of any of the foregoing, each Lender severally agrees to
pay to the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent), the Issuing Bank, the Swing Line Bank or such Related Party, as the case may be, such Lenders Pro Rata Share (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or
indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount, provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent (or

contemplated hereby or thereby, any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof. No Indemnitee referred to in Section 9.03(b) shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by unintended recipients of any

(e) Payments. All amounts due under this Section 9.03 shall be payable promptly after demand therefor. 
SECTION 9.04 Right of Set Off. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender, the Issuing Bank, the Swing

or final, in whatever currency) at any time held and other obligations (in whatever currency) at any time owing by such Lender, the Issuing Bank, the Swing Line Bank or any such Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower or any
other Loan Party against any and all of the Obligations of the Borrower or such Loan Party now or hereafter existing under this Agreement or any other Loan Document to such Lender, the Issuing Bank or the Swing Line Bank, irrespective of whether or
not such Lender, the Issuing Bank or the Swing Line Bank shall have made any demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and although such Obligations of the Borrower or such Loan Party may be contingent or unmatured or are owed to a
branch or office of such Lender, the Issuing Bank or the Swing Line Bank different from the branch or office holding such deposit or obligated on such indebtedness; provided that in the event that any Defaulting Lender shall exercise any such
right of setoff, (x) all amounts so set off shall be paid over immediately to the Administrative Agent and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of the

rights of setoff) that such Lender, the Issuing Bank, the Swing Line Bank or their respective Affiliates may have. Each Lender, the Issuing Bank and the Swing Line Bank agrees to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent promptly after any
such setoff and application; provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application. 
SECTION 9.05 Governing Law; Jurisdiction, Etc. 
(a) Governing Law. This Agreement and the other Loan Documents, unless expressly set forth therein, shall be governed
by, construed and enforced in accordance with, the law of the State of New York (including Sections 5.1401 and 5.1402 of the General Obligations Law of the State of New York), without reference to any other conflicts or choice of law principles
thereof. 
  96 


(b) Submission to Jurisdiction. The Borrower and each other Loan Party
irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York sitting in the Borough of Manhattan, New York and of the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto
irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York state court or, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, in such Federal court. Each of the
parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement or in any other
Loan Document shall affect any right that the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Bank may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document against the Borrower or any other Loan
Party or its properties in the courts of any jurisdiction.  (c) Waiver of Venue. The Borrower and each other Loan
Party irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any
other Loan Document in any court referred to in Section 9.05(b) of this Section. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.  (d) Service of Process. Each party hereto irrevocably
consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 9.01. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party hereto to serve process in any other manner permitted by Applicable Law. 
SECTION 9.06 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY
RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY
OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PERSON HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PERSON WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.06. 
SECTION 9.07 Reversal of Payments. To the extent any Loan Party makes a payment or payments to the Administrative Agent for the ratable
benefit of the Lenders or the Administrative Agent receives any payment or proceeds of the Collateral which payments or proceeds or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside and/or required
to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party under any Bankruptcy Law, state or federal law, common law or equitable cause, then, to the extent of such payment or proceeds repaid, the Obligations or part thereof intended to be satisfied
shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment or proceeds had not been received by the Administrative Agent. 
  97 


SECTION 9.08 Injunctive Relief. The Borrower and each other Loan Party recognize that, in
the event the Borrower or any other Loan Party fails to perform, observe or discharge any of its Obligations or liabilities under this Agreement, any remedy of law may prove to be inadequate relief to the Lenders. Therefore, the Borrower and each
other Loan Party agree that the Lenders, at the Lenders option, shall be entitled to temporary and permanent injunctive relief in any such case without the necessity of proving actual damages. 
SECTION 9.09 Accounting Matters. If at any time any change in GAAP (other than a change from the retail inventory method to the
weighted average cost method) would affect the computation of any financial ratio or requirement set forth in any Loan Document, and either the Borrower or the Required Lenders shall so request, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Borrower
shall negotiate in good faith to amend such ratio or requirement to preserve the original intent thereof in light of such change in GAAP (subject to the approval of the Required Lenders); provided that, until so amended, (i) such ratio
or requirement shall continue to be computed in accordance with GAAP prior to such change therein and (ii) the Borrower shall provide to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders financial statements and other documents required under this
Agreement or as reasonably requested hereunder setting forth a reconciliation between calculations of such ratio or requirement made before and after giving effect to such change in GAAP. 
SECTION 9.10 Successors and Assigns; Participations. 
(a) Successors and Assigns Generally. The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that, other than as expressly contemplated by Section 5.02(d)(iv), neither the Borrower nor any other Loan Party may assign or otherwise transfer any
of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and each Lender and no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder except (i) to an assignee in
accordance with the provisions of Section 9.10(b), (ii) by way of participation in accordance with the provisions of Section 9.10(d) or (iii) by way of pledge or assignment of a security interest subject to the
restrictions of Section 9.10(f) (and any other attempted assignment or transfer by any party hereto shall be null and void). Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the
parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants to the extent provided in Section 9.10(d) and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent
and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.  (b) Assignments by
Lenders. Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Revolving Credit Commitment and the Advances at the time owing to it);
provided that any such assignment shall be subject to the following conditions:  (i) Minimum Amounts. 
(A) in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lenders Revolving Credit Commitment and
the Advances at the time owing to it or in the case of an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund, no minimum amount need be assigned; and 
  98 


(B) in any case not described in Section 9.10(b)(i)(A), the
aggregate amount of the Revolving Credit Commitment (which for this purpose includes Advances outstanding thereunder) or, if the applicable Revolving Credit Commitment is not then in effect, the principal outstanding balance of the Advances of the
assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if Trade Date is specified in the Assignment and
Assumption, as of the Trade Date) shall not be less than $5,000,000, unless each of the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower otherwise consents (each such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed);  (ii) Proportionate Amounts. Each partial assignment shall be made as an
assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Advances or the Revolving Credit Commitment assigned; 
(iii) Required Consents. No consent shall be required for any assignment except to the extent required by
Section 9.10(b)(i)(B) of this Section and, in addition:  (A) the consent of the Borrower (such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld) shall be required unless (x) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of such assignment or (y) such assignment is to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund; provided,
that the Borrower shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment unless it shall object thereto by written notice to the Administrative Agent within 5 Business Days after having received notice thereof; 
(B) the consent of the Administrative Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required for
assignments if such assignment is to a Person that is not a Lender, an Affiliate of such Lender or an Approved Fund with respect to such Lender; and 
(C) the consents of the Issuing Bank and the Swing Line Bank (such consents not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall
be required for any assignment that increases the obligation of the assignee to participate in exposure under one or more Letters of Credit (whether or not then outstanding) or for any assignment in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility. 
(iv) Assignment and Assumption. The parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an
Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500 for each assignment (provided, that only one such fee will be payable in connection with simultaneous assignments to two or more Approved Funds by a Lender),
and the assignee, if it is not a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire.  (v)
No Assignment to Certain Persons. No such assignment shall be made to (A) the Borrower or any of the Borrowers Affiliates or Subsidiaries or (B) any Defaulting Lender or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Person who, upon
becoming a Lender hereunder, would constitute any of the foregoing Persons described in this clause (B).  (vi) No
Assignment to Natural Persons. No such assignment shall be made to a natural person.

rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments to the
Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with
the consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Advances previously requested, but not funded by, the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby
irrevocably consent), to (A) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank, the Swing Line Bank and each other Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon),
and (B) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro rata share of all Advances and participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Advances in accordance with its Pro Rata Share. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event
that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under Applicable Law without compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a
Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs.  Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative
Agent pursuant to Section 9.10(c), from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment
and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this
Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of
Sections 2.10, 2.12 and 9.03 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment; provided, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no
assignment by a Defaulting Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lenders having been a Defaulting Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this
Agreement that does not comply with this Section 9.10(b) shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with Section 9.10(d). 
(c) Register. The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, shall
maintain at one of its offices in Charlotte, North Carolina, a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Revolving Credit Commitment of, and principal
amounts of (and stated interest on) the Advances owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the Register). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrower, the Administrative
Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for
inspection by the Borrower and any Lender (but only to the extent of entries in the Register that are applicable to such Lender), at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. 
  100 


(d) Participations. Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or
notice to, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural person or the Borrower or any of the Borrowers Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a Participant) in all or a
portion of such Lenders rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Revolving Credit Commitment and/or the Advances owing to it); provided that (i) such Lenders obligations under this
Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, Issuing Bank, Swing Line Bank and the
other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement. 
Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right
to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any
amendment, modification or waiver or modification described in Section 9.02 that directly affects such Participant and could not be affected by a vote of the Required Lenders. Subject to Section 9.10(e), the Borrower agrees
that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.10 and 2.12 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to Section 9.10(b). To the extent permitted by
law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.04 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.13 as though it were a Lender. 
Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it
enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participants interest in the Advances or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the Participant Register);
provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register to any Person (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participants interest in any
commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under
Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the
owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a
Participant Register.  (e) Limitations upon Participant Rights. A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any
greater payment under Section 2.10(a) or (b) or Section 2.12 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the
participation to such Participant is made with the Borrowers prior written consent. No Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.10 and 2.12 unless the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such
Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section 2.12(e) as though it were a Lender. 
(f) Certain Pledges. Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights
under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including without limitation any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of
its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. 
  101 


SECTION 9.11 Confidentiality. Each of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, the Issuing
Bank and the Swing Line Bank agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its Affiliates and to its and its Affiliates respective partners, directors,
officers, employees, agents, advisors and other representatives (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information
confidential), (b) to the extent requested by, or required to be disclosed to, any rating agency, or regulatory or similar authority purporting to have jurisdiction over it (including any self-regulatory authority, such as the National
Association of Insurance Commissioners), (c) to the extent required by Applicable Laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to any other party hereto, (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies
under this Agreement, under any other Loan Document or under any Secured Hedge Agreement or Secured Cash Management Agreement, or any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any Secured Hedge Agreement or Secured
Cash Management Agreement, or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section 9.11, to (i) any assignee of or Participant in,
or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement, Participant or proposed Participant and (ii) any actual or prospective counterparty (or its advisors) to any swap or derivative transaction
relating to the Borrower and its obligations, (g) with the consent of the Borrower, (h) to Gold Sheets and other similar bank trade publications, such information to consist of deal terms and other information customarily found in such
publications, or (i) to the extent such Information (x) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section 9.11 or (y) becomes available to the Administrative Agent, any Lender, the Issuing Bank,
the Swing Line Bank or any of their respective Affiliates on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrower or (j) to Governmental Authorities in connection with any regulatory examination of the Administrative Agent or any
Lender or in accordance with the Administrative Agents or any Lenders regulatory compliance policy if the Administrative Agent or such Lender deems necessary for the mitigation of claims by those authorities against the Administrative
Agent or such Lender or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates. Information means all information received from any Loan Party or any Subsidiary thereof relating to any Loan Party or any Subsidiary thereof or any of their
respective businesses, other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent, any Lender, the Issuing Bank or the Swing Line Bank on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by any Loan Party or any Subsidiary thereof;
provided that, in the case of information received from a Loan Party or any Subsidiary thereof after the Effective Date, such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential. Any Person required to maintain the
confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section 9.11 shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as
such Person would accord to its own confidential information.  SECTION 9.12 Performance of Duties. Each of the Loan Partys
Obligations under this Agreement and each of the other Loan Documents shall be performed by such Loan Party at its sole cost and expense. 
SECTION 9.13 All Powers Coupled with Interest. All powers of attorney and other authorizations granted to the Lenders, the
Administrative Agent and any Persons designated by the Administrative Agent or any Lender pursuant to any provisions of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents shall be deemed coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable so long as
any of the Obligations remain unpaid or unsatisfied, any of the Commitments remain in effect or the Facility has not been terminated. 
  102 


SECTION 9.14 Survival. 
(a) All representations and warranties set forth in Article IV and all representations and warranties contained in any
certificate, or any of the Loan Documents (including, but not limited to, any such representation or warranty made in or in connection with any amendment thereto) shall constitute representations and warranties made under this Agreement. All
representations and warranties made under this Agreement shall be made or deemed to be made at and as of the Effective Date (except those that are expressly made as of a specific date), shall survive the Effective Date and shall not be waived by the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, any investigation made by or on behalf of the Lenders or any borrowing hereunder. 
(b) Notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement, the indemnities to which the Administrative Agent and the Lenders are
entitled under the provisions of this Article IX and any other provision of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall continue in full force and effect and shall protect the Administrative Agent and the Lenders against events arising
after such termination as well as before.  SECTION 9.15 Titles and Captions. Titles and captions of Articles, Sections and
subsections in, and the table of contents of, this Agreement are for convenience only, and neither limit nor amplify the provisions of this Agreement. 
SECTION 9.16 Severability of Provisions. Any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document which is prohibited or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions hereof or thereof or
affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction.  SECTION 9.17 Counterparts; Integration;
Effectiveness; Electronic Execution.  (a) Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be
executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto in different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. Delivery of an executed signature page of this
Agreement by facsimile transmission shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterparty hereof. This Agreement and the other Loan Documents constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and
supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and those of any other Loan Document, the provisions of this
Agreement shall control; provided that the inclusion of supplemental rights or remedies in favor of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders in any other Loan Document shall not be deemed a conflict with this Agreement. Each Loan Document was
drafted with the joint participation of the respective parties thereto and shall be construed neither against nor in favor of any party, but rather in accordance with the fair meaning thereof. Except as provided in Section 3.01, this
Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof that, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties
hereto.  (b) Electronic Execution of Assignments. The words execution, signed,
signature, and words of like import in any Assignment and Assumption shall be deemed to include electronic signatures or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or
enforceability as a manually executed signature or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent and as provided for in any Applicable Law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National
Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act, or any other similar state laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act. 
  103 


SECTION 9.18 Term of Agreement. This Agreement shall remain in effect from the Effective
Date through and including the date upon which all Obligations (other than contingent indemnification obligations not then due) arising hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall have been indefeasibly and irrevocably paid and satisfied in
full, all Letters of Credit have been terminated or expired and the Revolving Credit Commitment has been terminated. No termination of this Agreement shall affect the rights and obligations of the parties hereto arising prior to such termination or
in respect of any provision of this Agreement which survives such termination.  SECTION 9.19 USA PATRIOT Act. The Administrative
Agent and each Lender hereby notifies the Borrower that pursuant to the requirements of the PATRIOT Act, it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Borrower and the Guarantors, which information includes the name and
address of the Borrower and each Guarantor and other information that will allow such Lender to identify the Borrower or such Guarantor in accordance with the PATRIOT Act. 
SECTION 9.20 Independent Effect of Covenants. The Borrower expressly acknowledges and agrees that each covenant contained in Article
V hereof shall be given independent effect. Accordingly, the Borrower shall not engage in any transaction or other act otherwise permitted under any covenant contained in Article V, before or after giving effect to such transaction or
act, the Borrower shall or would be in breach of any other covenant contained in Article V.  SECTION 9.21 Inconsistencies with
Other Documents. In the event there is a conflict or inconsistency between this Agreement and any other Loan Document, the terms of this Agreement shall control; provided that any provision of the Collateral Documents which imposes
additional burdens on the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or further restricts the rights of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or gives the Administrative Agent or Lenders additional rights shall not be deemed to be in conflict or
inconsistent with this Agreement and shall be given full force and effect.  SECTION 9.22 No Advisory or Fiduciary Responsibility.
 (a) In connection with all aspects of each transaction contemplated hereby, each Loan Party acknowledges and agrees, and
acknowledges its Affiliates understanding, that (i) the facilities provided for hereunder and any related arranging or other services in connection therewith (including in connection with any amendment, waiver or other modification hereof
or of any other Loan Document) are an arms-length commercial transaction between the Borrower and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers and the Lenders, on the other hand, and the Borrower is capable of
evaluating and understanding and understands and accepts the terms, risks and conditions of the transactions contemplated hereby and by the other Loan Documents (including any amendment, waiver or other modification hereof or thereof), (ii) in
connection with the process leading to such transaction, each of the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers and the Lenders is and has been acting solely as a principal and is not the financial advisor, agent or fiduciary, for the Borrower or any of
its Affiliates, stockholders, creditors or employees or any other Person, (iii) none of the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers or the Lenders has assumed or will assume an advisory, agency or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Borrower
with respect to any of the transactions contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto, including with respect to any amendment, waiver or other modification hereof or of any other Loan Document (irrespective of whether any Arranger or Lender
has advised or is currently advising the Borrower or any of its Affiliates on other matters) and none of the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers or the Lenders has any obligation to the 
  104 



Borrower or any of its Affiliates with respect to the financing transactions contemplated hereby except those obligations expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, (iv) the
Arrangers and the Lenders and their respective Affiliates may be engaged in a broad range of transactions that involve interests that differ from, and may conflict with, those of the Borrower and its Affiliates, and none of the Administrative Agent,
the Arrangers or the Lenders has any obligation to disclose any of such interests by virtue of any advisory, agency or fiduciary relationship and (v) the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers and the Lenders have not provided and will not provide
any legal, accounting, regulatory or tax advice with respect to any of the transactions contemplated hereby (including any amendment, waiver or other modification hereof or of any other Loan Document) and the Credit Parties have consulted their own
legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent they have deemed appropriate.  (b) Each Loan Party
acknowledges and agrees that each Lender, each Arranger and any Affiliate thereof may lend money to, invest in, and generally engage in any kind of business with, any of the Borrower, any Affiliate thereof or any other person or entity that may do
business with or own securities of any of the foregoing, all as if such Lender, Arranger or Affiliate thereof were not a Lender or Arranger or an Affiliate thereof (or an agent or any other person with any similar role under the Facilities) and
without any duty to account therefor to any other Lender, the Arrangers, the Borrower or any Affiliate of the foregoing. Each Lender, each Arranger and any Affiliate thereof may accept fees and other consideration from the Borrower or any
Affiliate thereof for services in connection with this Agreement, the Facilities or otherwise without having to account for the same to any other Lender, the Arrangers, the Borrower or any Affiliate of the foregoing. 
SECTION 9.23 Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to
be paid under the Loan Documents shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious interest permitted by Applicable Law (the Maximum Rate). If the Administrative Agent or any Lender shall receive interest in an amount that
exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the Advances or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the Borrower. In determining whether the interest contracted for, charged, or received by the
Administrative Agent or a Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather than interest, (b) exclude
voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the Obligations hereunder.

Certificate of Chief Financial Officer 
CRACKER BARREL OLD COUNTRY STORE, INC. 
I,                     , hereby
certify that I am the Chief Financial Officer of CRACKER BARREL OLD COUNTRY STORE, INC., a Tennessee corporation (the Company), and that I am duly authorized to execute this Solvency Certificate on behalf of the Company, which is
being delivered pursuant Section 3.01(a)(viii) of the Credit Agreement dated as of January 8, 2015 (as amended, amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the Credit Agreement)
among the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors party thereto, the Lender Parties party thereto, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (Wells Fargo), as collateral agent (in such capacity, the Collateral Agent),
and Wells Fargo, as Administrative Agent. Unless otherwise defined herein, terms defined in the Credit Agreement are used herein as therein defined. 
I do hereby further certify that I am generally familiar with the prospects, businesses, assets and finances of the Company and have carefully
reviewed the contents of this Solvency Certificate and, in connection herewith, have reviewed such other documentation and information and have made such investigation and inquiries as I deem necessary and prudent therefor. 
I understand that the Agents and the other Lenders are relying on the truth and accuracy of this Solvency Certificate in connection with the
transactions contemplated by the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents.  I do hereby further certify to the Administrative Agent,
in good faith and to the best of my knowledge and belief, as follows:  1. The financial projections delivered to the Lenders pursuant to
Section 3.01(a)(x) of the Credit Agreement (the Projections) were prepared in good faith on the basis of the assumptions stated therein, which assumptions were fair in the light of the conditions then existing and
continue to be fair in light of the conditions existing on the date hereof (it being understood that (x) projections as to future events are not to be viewed as fact; and (y) because certain assumptions may not materialize, either
partially or wholly, and because unanticipated events may occur and circumstances may arise subsequent to the date of the Projections, actual results during the period or periods covered by the Projections may differ materially from the projected
results. I believe the Projections provide reasonable estimation of future performance subject, as stated above, to the uncertainty and approximation inherent in any projections. 
2. I have concluded, in good faith and to the best of my knowledge and belief that, as of the date hereof, immed

and its respective Subsidiaries.  For
purposes of this Solvency Certificate, the fair salable value of the Loan Parties and their Subsidiaries assets has been determined on the basis of the amount that I have concluded, in good faith and to the best of my
knowledge and belief, may be realized within a reasonable time, either through collection or sale of such assets at the regular market value, conceiving the latter as the amount that could be obtained for the assets in question within such period by
a capable and diligent business person from an interested buyer who is willing to purchase under ordinary selling conditions.  Delivery of
an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Solvency Certificate by telecopier or electronic mail shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Solvency Certificate. 
[Signature Page Follows] 


IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned has executed this Solvency Certificate this 8th day of
January, 2015.
