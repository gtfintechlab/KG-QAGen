funds are to be made available to Borrower under the Loan Papers; (iii) to take any action that it properly requests under the Loan Papers (subject to the concurrence of other Lenders as may be required under the Loan Papers); (iv) to

$1,000,000,000 (as shown on its most recently published statement of condition). Upon its acceptance of appointment as successor Administrative Agent, the successor Administrative Agent succeeds to and becomes vested with all of the Rights of the
prior Administrative Agent, and the prior Administrative Agent is discharged from its duties and obligations of Administrative Agent under the Loan Papers (but, when used in connection with LCs issued and outstanding before the appointment of the
successor Administrative Agent, Administrative Agent shall continue to refer solely to Citizens Bank, N.A.), and each Lender shall execute such documents as any Lender, the resigning or removed Administrative Agent, or the successor

Administrative Agent may not be compelled to do any act under the Loan Papers or to take any action toward the execution or enforcement of the powers thereby created or to prosecute or defend any suit in respect of the Loan Papers. If Administrative
Agent requests instructions from Lenders, or Majority Lenders, as the case may be, with respect to any act or action in connection with any Loan Paper, Administrative Agent is entitled to refrain (without incurring any liability to any Person by so
refraining) from that act or action unless and until it has received instructions. In no event, however, may Administrative Agent or any of its Representatives be required to take any action that it or they determine could incur for it or them
criminal or onerous civil liability. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no Lender has any right of action against Administrative Agent as a result of Administrative Agents acting or refraining from acting under this Agreement in
