LOAN AGREEMENT 
THIS LOAN AGREEMENT (this Agreement), dated as of January 5, 2022 (the Effective Date) by
and among COHERUS BIOSCIENCES, INC., a Delaware corporation (as Borrower and a Credit Party), COHERUS INTERMEDIATE CORP., a Delaware corporation (as an additional Credit Party), INTEKRIN THERAPEUTICS INC., a Delaware corporation
(as an additional Credit Party), the other Guarantors signatory hereto or otherwise party hereto from time to time, as additional Credit Parties, BIOPHARMA CREDIT PLC, a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales with
company number 10443190 (as the Collateral Agent), BPCR LIMITED PARTNERSHIP, a limited partnership established under the laws of England and Wales with registration number LP020944 (as a Lender) and BIOPHARMA
CREDIT INVESTMENTS V (MASTER) LP, a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership acting by its general partner, BioPharma Credit Investments V GP LLC (as a Lender), provides the terms on which each Lender shall make, and Borrower
shall repay, the Credit Extensions (as hereinafter defined). The parties hereto agree as follows:  1 ACCOUNTING AND OTHER
TERMS  Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all accounting terms not otherwise defined in this Agreement shall have the
meanings assigned to them in conformity with Applicable Accounting Standards. Calculations and determinations must be made following Applicable Accounting Standards. If at any time any change in Applicable Accounting Standards would affect the
computation of any financial requirement set forth in any Loan Document (including for purposes of measuring compliance with any provision of Section 6), and either Borrower or the Collateral Agent shall so request, the
Collateral Agent and Borrower shall enter into a mutually acceptable amendment to amend such requirement to preserve the original intent thereof in light of such change in Applicable Accounting Standards; provided, that, until so
amended, (x) such requirement shall continue to be computed in accordance with Applicable Accounting Standards prior to such change therein and (y) all financial statements, Compliance Certificates and similar documents provided, delivered
or submitted hereunder shall be provided, delivered or submitted together with a reconciliation between the calculations and amounts set forth therein before and after giving effect to such change in Applicable Accounting Standards. Notwithstanding
any other provision contained herein, all terms of an accounting or financial nature used herein shall be construed, and all computations of amounts referred to herein, including in Section 5 and
Section 6 shall be made, without giving effect to any (a) election under ASC 825-10 (or any other Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification
(ASC) or Financial Accounting Standard having a similar result or effect) to value any Indebtedness or other liabilities of any Credit Party or any Subsidiary of any Credit Party at fair value and (b) any treatment of
Indebtedness in respect of convertible debt instruments under ASC 470-20 (or any other ASC or Financial Accounting Standard having a similar result or effect) to value any such Indebtedness in a reduced or
bifurcated manner as described therein, and such Indebtedness shall at all times be valued at the full stated principal amount thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary above or in the definition of Capital Lease Obligations, all
obligations of any Person that are or would have been treated as operating leases for purposes of Applicable Accounting Standards prior to the effectiveness of ASC 842 shall continue to be accounted for as operating leases for all purposes hereunder
or under any other Loan Documents (whether or not such operating lease obligations were in effect on such date) notwithstanding the fact that such obligations are required in accordance with ASC 842 (on a prospective or retroactive basis or
otherwise) to be treated as Capital Leases. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this Agreement shall have the meanings set forth in Section 13. All other terms contained in this Agreement, unless otherwise indicated,
shall have the meaning provided by the Code to the extent such terms are defined therein. All references to Dollars or $ are United States Dollars, unless otherwise noted. 
For purposes of determining compliance with Section 6 with respect to the amount of any Indebtedness in a currency
other than Dollars, no Default or Event of Default shall be deemed to have occurred solely as a result of changes in rates of currency exchange occurring after the time such Indebtedness is incurred, made or acquired (so long as such Indebtedness,
at the time incurred, made or acquired, was permitted hereunder).

(i) Any prepayment of the Tranche A Loan by Borrower (A) pursuant to Section 2.2(c), or

ANY PRESENT OR FUTURE REQUIREMENTS OF LAW THAT PROHIBITS OR MAY PROHIBIT THE COLLECTION OF ANY MAKEWHOLE AMOUNT OR PREPAYMENT PREMIUM IN CONNECTION WITH ANY SUCH PREPAYMENT OR ACCELERATION OR OTHERWISE. Borrower expressly agrees that (to the fullest
extent it may lawfully do so) that: (i) each Makewhole Amount and Prepayment Premium is reasonable and is the product of an arms-length transaction among sophisticated business people, ably
represented by counsel; (ii) each Makewhole Amount and Prepayment Premium shall be payable notwithstanding the then-prevailing market rates at the time payment thereof is made; (iii) there has been a course of conduct among Lenders and
Borrower giving specific consideration in this transaction for such agreement to pay each Makewhole Amount and Prepayment Premium; and (iv) Borrower shall be estopped hereafter from claiming differently than as agreed to in this
Section 2.2(g). Borrower expressly acknowledges that its agreement to pay the Makewhole Amount and Prepayment Premium, as the case may be, to applicable Lenders as herein described is a material inducement to such Lenders
to make any Credit Extension.  2.3. Payment of Interest on the Term Loans. 
(a) Interest Rate. 
(i) Subject to Section 2.3(b), the principal amount outstanding under each Term Loan shall accrue
interest at a per annum rate equal to the LIBOR Rate (fixed for each Interest Period at the rate determined on the Interest Rate Determination Date for such Interest Period) plus eight and one quarter percent (8.25%) per annum (the Term
Loan Rate), which interest shall be payable quarterly in arrears in accordance with this Section 2.3.

(ii) Interest shall accrue on each Term Loan commencing on, and including,
the day on which such Term Loan is made, and shall accrue on such Term Loan, or any portion thereof, through and including the day on which such Term Loan or such portion is paid. 
(iii) Interest is due and payable quarterly on each Interest Date, as calculated by the Collateral Agent (which calculations
shall be deemed correct absent manifest error), commencing on the Interest Date occurring in the first full calendar quarter immediately following the Tranche A Closing Date; provided, however, that if any such date is not a Business
Day, the applicable interest shall be due and payable on the first Business Day immediately after such date.  (b) Default Rate . In
the event Borrower fails to pay any of the Obligations when due or upon the commencement and during the continuance of an Insolvency Proceeding of Borrower or upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any other Event of Default, immediately
(and without notice or demand by any Lender or the Collateral Agent for payment thereof) to Borrower, such past due Obligations shall accrue interest at a rate per annum which is three percentage points (3.00%) above the rate that is otherwise
applicable thereto (the Default Rate), and such interest shall be payable entirely in cash on demand of any Lender or the Collateral Agent. Payment or acceptance of the increased interest rate provided in this
Section 2.3(b) is not a permitted alternative to timely payment of any Obligations and shall not constitute a waiver of any Event of Default or otherwise prejudice or limit any rights or remedies of the Collateral Agent or
any Lender.  (c) 360-Day Year . Interest payable under each Term Loan shall be computed on
the basis of a year of 360 days and the actual number of days elapsed.  (d) Payments. Except as otherwise expressly provided
herein, all Term Loan payments and any other payments hereunder by (or on behalf of) Borrower shall be made on the date specified herein to such bank account of each applicable Lender as such Lender (or the Collateral Agent) shall have designated in
a written notice to Borrower delivered on or before the Tranche A Closing Date (which such notice may be updated by such Lender (or the Collateral Agent) by written notice to the Borrower from time to time after the Tranche A Closing Date). Except
as otherwise expressly provided herein, interest is payable quarterly on each Interest Date. Payments of principal or interest received after 11:00 a.m. on such date are considered received at the opening of business on the next Business Day. When
any payment is due on a day that is not a Business Day, such payment is due on the next Business Day thereafter and additional fees or interest, as applicable, shall continue to accrue until paid. All payments to be made by Borrower hereunder or
under any other Loan Document, including payments of principal and interest made hereunder and pursuant to any other Loan Document, and all fees, expenses, indemnities and reimbursements, shall be made without
set-off, recoupment or counterclaim, in lawful money of the United States and in immediately available funds. Any payments of principal or interest required to be paid under Sections 2.2(b) or
2.3(a) shall not be considered a prepayment hereunder unless so designated in writing by Borrower in accordance with Section 2.2(c)(i). 
(e) Benchmark Replacement Setting. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document: 
(i) Replacing USD LIBOR. On March 5, 2021 the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the
regulatory supervisor of USD LIBORs administrator (IBA), announced in a public statement the future cessation or loss of representativeness of overnight/Spot Next, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month and 12- month USD LIBOR tenor settings. On the earlier of (A) the date that all Available Tenors of USD LIBOR
have either permanently or indefinitely ceased to be provided by IBA or have been announced by or on behalf of the FCA pursuant to public statement or publication of information to be no longer representative and (B) the Early Opt-in Effective Date, if the then-current Benchmark is USD LIBOR, the Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of any setting of such
Benchmark on such day and all subsequent settings without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document. If the Benchmark Replacement is Daily Simple SOFR, all interest payments will
be payable on a quarterly basis.  (ii) Replacing Future Benchmarks. Upon the occurrence of a Benchmark
Transition Event, the Benchmark Replacement will replace the then-current Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of any Benchmark setting at or after 5:00 p.m. on the fifth (5th) Business

  -5- 





Day after the date notice of such Benchmark Replacement is provided to Borrower and the Lenders without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any
other Loan Document so long as the Collateral Agent has not received, by such time, written notice of objection to such Benchmark Replacement from Lenders comprising the Required Lenders. At any time that the administrator of the then-current
Benchmark has permanently or indefinitely ceased to provide such Benchmark or such Benchmark has been announced by or on behalf of the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark pursuant to public statement or publication of
information to be no longer representative of the underlying market and economic reality that such Benchmark is intended to measure and that representativeness will not be restored, Borrower, with respect to any request (pursuant to
Section 3.7) for a borrowing of Term Loans to be made that would bear interest by reference to such Benchmark, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a borrowing of Term Loans to be made that will
bear interest by reference to the Benchmark Replacement that has replaced such Benchmark.  (iii) Benchmark
Replacement Conforming Changes. In connection with the implementation and administration of a Benchmark Replacement, the Collateral Agent will have the right to make Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement. 
(iv) Notices; Standards for Decisions and Determinations. The Collateral Agent will promptly notify Borrower and
the Lenders of (A) the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement and (ii) the effectiveness of any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes. Any determination, decision or election that may be made by the Collateral Agent or, if
applicable, any Lender (or group of Lenders) pursuant to this Section 2.3(e), including any determination with respect to a tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or
non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action, will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error and may be made in its or their sole discretion
and without consent from any other party to this Agreement.  (v) Unavailability of Tenor of Benchmark. At any
time (including in connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement), (i) if the then-current Benchmark is a term rate (including Term SOFR or USD LIBOR), then the Collateral Agent may remove any tenor of such Benchmark that is
unavailable or non-representative tenor for Benchmark (including Benchmark Replacement) settings and (ii) the Collateral Agent may reinstate any such previously removed tenor for Benchmark (including
Benchmark Replacement) settings.  2.4. Expenses. Borrower shall pay to or reimburse (or pay directly on behalf of) the Collateral
Agent and, as applicable, each Lender, all of such Persons reasonable and documented Lender Expenses incurred through and after the Effective Date, promptly after receipt of a written demand therefor by such Lender or the Collateral Agent
(with, in the case of any Lender, a copy of such demand to the Collateral Agent), setting forth in reasonable detail such Persons Lender Expenses. 
2.5. Requirements of Law; Increased Costs. In the event that any applicable Change in Law: 
(a) Does or shall subject any Lender to any Tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to this Agreement or the Term Loans (except, in each case,
Indemnified Taxes, Taxes described in clause (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes, and Connection Income Taxes); 
(b) Does or shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve, capital requirement, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or
similar requirements against assets held by, or deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, advances or loans by, or other credit extended by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any Lender; or 
(c) Does or shall impose on any Lender any other condition (other than Taxes); and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost
to such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith using calculation methods customary in the industry) of making, renewing or maintaining the Term Loans or to reduce any amount receivable in respect thereof or to reduce the rate of return
on the capital of such Lender or any Person controlling such Lender, 
  -6- 




then, in any such case, Borrower shall promptly pay to the applicable Lender, within thirty (30) days
of its receipt of the certificate described below, any additional amounts necessary to compensate such Lender for such additional cost or reduced amounts receivable or rate of return as reasonably determined by such Lender with respect to this
Agreement or the Term Loans made hereunder. If any Lender becomes entitled to claim any additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.5, it shall promptly notify Borrower in writing of the event by reason of which it has
become so entitled (with a copy of such notice to the Collateral Agent), and a certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to the foregoing sentence containing the calculation thereof in reasonable detail submitted by such Lender to
Borrower (with a copy of such certificate to the Collateral Agent) shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. The provisions hereof shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the outstanding Term Loans and all
other Obligations. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation for any increased costs or reduction in amounts received or receivable or reduction in return on capital under this Section 2.5 shall not
constitute a waiver of such Lenders right to demand such compensation; provided that Borrower shall not be under any obligation to compensate such Lender under this Section 2.5 with respect to increased costs
or reductions with respect to any period prior to the date that is 180 days prior to the date of the delivery of the notice required pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this paragraph; provided, further, that if the Change in Law
giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof. 
2.6. Taxes; Withholding, Etc. 
(a) All sums payable by any Credit Party hereunder and under the other Loan Documents shall (except to the extent required by Requirements of
Law) be paid free and clear of, and without any deduction or withholding on account of, any Tax imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by any Governmental Authority. In addition, Borrower agrees to pay, and shall indemnify and hold each
Lender harmless from, Other Taxes, and as soon as practicable after the date of paying Other Taxes to a Governmental Authority, Borrower shall furnish to each Lender (as applicable, with a copy to the Collateral Agent) the original or a certified
copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof or other evidence reasonably satisfactory to such Lender.  (b) If any Credit Party or any
other Person (Withholding Agent) is required by Requirements of Law to make any deduction or withholding on account of any Tax (as determined in the good faith discretion of such Withholding Agent) from any sum paid or payable by
any Credit Party to any Lender under any of the Loan Documents: (i) such Withholding Agent shall notify such Lender in writing (with a copy to the Collateral Agent) of any such requirement or any change in any such requirement promptly after
such Withholding Agent becomes aware of it; (ii) such Withholding Agent shall make any such withholding or deduction; (iii) such Withholding Agent shall pay any such Tax before the date on which penalties attach thereto, such payment to be
made (if the liability to pay is imposed on any Credit Party) for its own account or (if that liability is imposed on such Lender, as the case may be) on behalf of and in the name of such Lender in accordance with Requirements of Law; (iv) if
the Tax is an Indemnified Tax, the sum payable by such Credit Party in respect of which the relevant deduction, withholding or payment of Indemnified Tax is required shall be increased to the extent necessary to ensure that, after the making of that
deduction, withholding or payment (including any deductions for Indemnified Taxes applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.6(b)), such Lender receives on the due date a net sum equal to what it would have
received had no such deduction, withholding or payment of Indemnified Tax been required or made; and (v) as soon as practicable after paying any sum from which it is required by Requirements of Law to make any deduction or withholding, Borrower
shall (or shall cause such Withholding Agent, if not Borrower, to) deliver to such Lender (with a copy to the Collateral Agent) evidence reasonably satisfactory to such Lender of such deduction, withholding or payment and of the remittance thereof
to the relevant taxing or other Governmental Authority.  (c) The Credit Parties shall jointly and severally indemnify each Lender for the
full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 2.6(c)) paid by such Lender and any liability (including any reasonable
expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. Any indemnification payment pursuant to this
Section 2.6(c) shall be made to the applicable Lender within fifteen (15) days from written demand therefor. 
  -7- 




(d) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with
respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to Borrower, at the time or times reasonably requested by Borrower, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by Borrower as will permit such payments to be
made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, such Lender, if reasonably requested by Borrower, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by Borrower as will enable
Borrower to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such
documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 2.6(d)(i), (ii) or (iv) below) shall not be required if in such Lenders reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission
would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. For avoidance of doubt, for the purposes of this Section 2.6(d), the term
Lender shall include each applicable assignee. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing:  (i) If any
Lender is organized under the laws of the United States of America or any state thereof, such Lender shall deliver, and shall cause each applicable assignee thereof to deliver, to Borrower two (2) executed copies of Internal Revenue Service
(IRS) Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax. 
(ii) If any Lender is a Foreign Lender, such Lender shall deliver, and shall cause each applicable assignee thereof to deliver,
to Borrower, on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement, and at such other times as may be necessary in the determination of Borrower (in the reasonable exercise of its discretion), whichever of the
following is applicable:  (1) in the case that such Lender is a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the
United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document (including any original issue discount), a properly completed and duly executed copy of IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS
Form W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the interest article of such tax treaty and
(y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, a properly completed and duly executed copy of IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the business profits or other income article of such tax treaty; 
(2) a completed and duly executed copy of IRS Form W-8ECI; 
(3) in the case that such Foreign Lender is claiming an exemption from U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the portfolio interest
exemption under Section 881(c) of the IRC, it shall provide Borrower with the applicable executed IRS Form W-8BEN-E or IRS Form
W-8BEN, as applicable, and a certificate reasonably satisfactory to Borrower to the effect that any interest received by such Foreign Lender is not received by a bank on extension of credit
made pursuant to a loan agreement entered into in the ordinary course of its trade or business within the meaning of 881(c)(3)(A) of the IRC, a 10 percent shareholder of Borrower within the meaning of Section 871(h)(3)(B)
of the IRC, or a controlled foreign corporation related to Borrower as described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the IRC, or 
(4) to the extent that such Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, an executed copy of IRS Form
W-8IMY, accompanied by a withholding statement and IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or
W-8BEN, as applicable), IRS Form W-9 or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and
one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a certificate referenced in Section 2.6(d)(ii)(3) above on behalf of each such direct or indirect
partner. 
  -8- 




(iii) If any Lender is a Foreign Lender it shall, to the extent it is
legally entitled to do so, deliver to Borrower (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which it becomes a party to this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of
Borrower), executed copies of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by
applicable law to permit Borrower to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made.  (iv) If a payment made to
any Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b)
of the IRC, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to Borrower at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by Borrower such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section
1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the IRC) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by Borrower as may be necessary for Borrower to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that Lender has complied with its obligations under FATCA
or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (iv), FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. 
(v) Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in
any respect, it shall update such form or certification or notify the Borrower in writing of its legal inability to do so.  (e) If any
party hereto determines, in its discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 2.6 (including by the payment of additional amounts
pursuant to this Section 2.6), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, under this
Section 2.6 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified
party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid
over pursuant to this clause (e) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority and the requirement to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority is not due to the
indemnified partys failure to timely provide complete and accurate Internal Revenue Service forms and other documentation required pursuant to Section 2.6(d) or Section 2.8. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this clause (e), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this clause (e) if the payment of such amount would place the indemnified party
in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or
otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such tax had never been paid. This clause (e) shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any
other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.  2.7.
Additional Consideration. As additional consideration for the obligation of each Lender to fund its Applicable Percentage of the Term Loans and the funding of its Applicable Percentage of the Term Loans pursuant to
Section 2.2(a) and Section 3.7, on the Tranche A Closing Date, Borrower shall pay to each Lender an amount equal to the product of (i) the sum of such Lenders Tranche A Commitment,
Tranche B Commitment, Tranche C Commitment and Tranche D Commitment, multiplied by (ii) 0.02 (such product, the Additional Consideration). Any and all Additional Consideration shall be fully earned when paid and shall not
be refundable for any reason whatsoever and shall be treated as original issue discount with respect to the Tranche A Loan for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Additional Consideration payable hereunder shall be due on the Tranche A Closing
Date and deducted from the proceeds of the Tranche A Loan to be advanced to Borrower pursuant to Section 2.2(a) and Section 3.7. 
  -9- 




2.8. Note Register; Term Loan Notes.   (a) Note Register. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
Borrower hereby designates Collateral Agent to serve as Borrowers agent solely for purposes of maintaining at all times at its principal office a book entry system as described in Treasury Regulations
Section 5f.103-1(c)(1)(ii) that identifies each beneficial owner that is entitled to a payment of principal and stated interest on each Term Loan (the Note Register) and provides for
the registration and transfer of Term Loan Notes so that each Term Loan is at all times in registered form as described in IRC Treasury Regulations Section 5f.103-1(c) or Proposed Section 1.163-5(b) (or, in each case, any amended or successor version). Each Term Loan: (i) shall, pursuant to this clause (a), be also registered as to both principal and any stated interest with
Borrower or its agent, and (ii) may be transferred or exchanged by any Lender only by (1) surrender of the old instrument and either (x) the reissuance by Borrower of the old instrument to the new Lender or (y) the issuance by
Borrower of a new instrument to the new Lender, or (2) confirmation with Borrower that the right to the principal and stated interest on such Term Loan is maintained through the book entry system kept by the Collateral Agent. Each Lender,
severally and not jointly, represents that any interest that may become due and owing under this Agreement qualifies for the portfolio interest exception from withholding on interest payments pursuant to IRC Sections 871(h) and 881(c). 
(b) Term Loan Notes. Each Lender shall issue to Borrower, and Borrower shall execute and deliver to each Lender to evidence such
Lenders Term Loan, (i) on the Tranche A Closing Date, a Tranche A Note, and (ii) on the Tranche B Closing Date, a Tranche B Note. All amounts due under the Term Loan Notes shall be repayable as set forth in this Agreement and
interest shall accrue on the principal amount of the Term Loans represented by the Term Loan Notes, in each case, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. All Term Loan Notes shall rank for all purposes pari passu with each other. 
2.9. Additional Facility Amount. 
(a) Availability. Borrower shall have the right, but not the obligation, to request in writing (the Additional Facility
Amount Request) that the Lenders make one or more term loans to Borrower in an aggregate principal amount up to the Additional Facility Amount by delivering to the Collateral Agent and each Lender, at any time following the Tranche A
Closing Date; provided, however, that such right, and any obligations of the Collateral Agent or any Lender under this Section 2.9, shall terminate automatically without any further action by any party hereto
and be of no further force and effect if any prepayment of the Tranche A Loan, Tranche B Loan, Tranche C Loan or Tranche D Loan, as applicable, is made, on or before the valid delivery by Borrower of the Additional Facility Amount Request. 
(b) Terms and Conditions. Promptly upon confirmation by the Collateral Agent of the receipt of the Additional Facility Amount
Request by each Lender, at the Collateral Agents request, representatives of Borrower and the Required Lenders shall meet (in person or telephonically) to discuss in good faith: (i) the exact Additional Facility Amount that Borrower
intends to borrow, the number of term loans that Borrower intends be made to it with respect to such Additional Facility Amount and the dates on which Borrower intends for such term loans to be advanced to it by Lenders; (ii) the amortization
of such term loans; (iii) the inclusion of additional and amended terms, which would be applicable to all of the Term Loans; and (iv) the date on which all unpaid principal with respect to such term loans (and, for the avoidance of doubt,
all accrued and unpaid interest thereon and any other amounts payable with respect thereto under the Loan Documents) shall be due and payable in full; provided, however, that no Lender is under any obligation to agree to make any such
term loans. The parties hereto agree that, unless otherwise agreed by the Required Lenders in their sole discretion, all other terms and conditions applicable to the term loans proposed to be made to Borrower with respect to the Additional Facility
Amount shall be as set forth in this Agreement (including Sections 2.2(e), (f) and (g) and Section 2.7), except for such deviations thereto as may be reasonably necessary to reflect the terms
described in clauses (i)  (iv) above which are mutually agreed to by Borrower and the Required Lenders and such other changes are as reasonably necessary to incorporate herein the making of such term loans. 
  -10- 




(c) Additional Lenders. In connection with the Additional Facility Amount
Request, the Collateral Agent and the Required Lenders may invite, to become a Lender for purposes of making Credit Extensions relating to the Additional Facility Amount, (i) one or more investment funds managed by Pharmakon Advisors, LP, in
each case without Borrowers consent or the consent of any other Lender, or (ii) one or more prospective third-party lenders identified by Pharmakon Advisors, LP, in each case with Borrowers prior written consent but without the
consent of any other Lender. The Collateral Agent shall endeavor to cause each such Person that agrees to make any term loan with respect to the Additional Facility Amount and makes any such term loan to timely provide complete and accurate Internal
Revenue Service forms and other documentation required pursuant to Section 2.6(d) or Section 2.8 and the Collateral Agent shall update the Register as required to reflect any such term loan made by
such Person.  (d) Lender Approval. Following the mutual agreement of the terms described in Sections 2.9(a)(i)
(iv) above, each Lender shall have the right, but not the obligation, to agree to make the Credit Extensions relating to the Additional Facility Amount in accordance with such terms and otherwise in accordance with the terms and conditions
herein; provided, however, that if such terms are agreed to by the Required Lenders and this Agreement is amended or restated as provided in Section 2.9(e) below, such Lender agrees to execute and deliver a
counterpart of such amendment or restatement to effect such amendment or restatement irrespective of whether such Lender agrees to make any Credit Extensions relating to the Additional Facility Amount (so long as, for the avoidance of doubt, such
amendment or restatement does not commit such Lender to make any such Credit Extension that such Lender declines to make).  (e)
Amendment to Loan Agreement. In the event Borrower and the Required Lenders mutually agree on the terms described in Sections 2.9(a)(i) (iv) above, the parties hereto agree to amend or restate this Agreement to reflect
such terms in this Agreement and to otherwise incorporate in this Agreement the term loans to be made with respect to the Additional Facility Amount, including such amendments or restatements as may be reasonably necessary to confirm that such term
loans are Term Loans for all purposes hereunder.  3 CONDITIONS OF TERM LOANS

Change.  8 RIGHTS AND REMEDIES UPON AN EVENT OF DEFAULT 
8.1. Rights and Remedies. While an Event of Default occurs and continues, the Collateral Agent may, or at the request of the
Required Lenders, will, without notice or demand:  (a) declare all Obligations (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any and all amounts
payable pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and Section 2.2(f), as applicable) immediately due and payable (but if an Event of Default described in Section 7.5 occurs, all
Obligations, including any and all amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and Section 2.2(f), as applicable, are automatically and immediately due and payable without any notice, demand or
other action by the Collateral Agent or any Lender), whereupon all Obligations for principal, interest, premium or otherwise (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any and all amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and
Section 2.2(f), as applicable) shall become due and payable by Borrower without presentment for payment, demand, notice of protest or other demand or notice of any kind, which are all expressly waived by the Credit Parties
hereby; 
  -42- 




(b) stop advancing money or extending credit for Borrowers benefit under this
Agreement;  (c) settle or adjust disputes and claims directly with Account Debtors for amounts on terms and in any order that the
Collateral Agent considers advisable, notify any Person owing Borrower money of the Collateral Agents security interest, for the benefit of the Lenders and the other Secured Parties, in such funds, and verify the amount of the Collateral
Accounts;  (d) make any payments and do any acts it considers necessary or reasonable to protect the Collateral or the Collateral
Agents security interest, for the benefit of Lenders and the other Secured Parties, in the Collateral. Borrower shall assemble the Collateral if the Collateral Agent or the Required Lenders requests and make it available as the Collateral
Agent designates or the Required Lenders designate. The Collateral Agent or its agents or representatives may enter premises where the Collateral is located, take and maintain possession of any part of the Collateral, and pay, purchase, contest, or
compromise any Lien that appears to be prior or superior to its security interest, for the benefit of Lenders and the other Secured Parties, and pay all expenses incurred. Borrower grants the Collateral Agent an irrevocable, royalty-free license or
other right to enter, use, operate and occupy (and for its agents or representatives to enter, use, operate and occupy), without charge, any such premises to exercise any of the Collateral Agents or any Lenders rights or remedies under
this Section 8.1 (including in order to take possession of, collect, receive, assemble, process, appropriate, remove, realize upon, advertise for sale, sell, assign, license out, convey, transfer or grant options to
purchase any Collateral), in each case, exercisable solely while an Event of Default occurs and continues;  (e) apply to the Obligations
(i) any balances and deposits of Borrower it holds, (ii) any amount held by the Collateral Agent owing to or for the credit or the account of Borrower or (iii) any balance from any Collateral Account of any Credit Party (or instruct
the bank at which any such Collateral Account is maintained to pay the balance of any such Collateral Account to the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of Lenders and the other Secured Parties, or to any Lender on behalf of itself and the other
Secured Parties, as the Collateral Agent shall direct;  (f) ship, reclaim, recover, store, finish, maintain, repair, prepare for sale,
advertise for sale, and sell the Collateral. With respect to any and all Intellectual Property owned or held by any Credit Party and included in Collateral, each Credit Party hereby grants to the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of Lenders and the
other Secured Parties, as of the Tranche A Closing Date and exercisable solely while an Event of Default occurs and continues: (i) an irrevocable, non-exclusive, assignable, royalty-free license or other
right to use (and for its agents or representatives to use), without charge, including the right to sublicense, use and practice, any and all such Intellectual Property in order to take possession of, collect, receive, assemble, process,
appropriate, remove, realize upon, advertise for sale, sell, assign, license out, convey, transfer or grant options to purchase any Collateral, and access to all media in which any of the licensed items may be recorded or stored and to all Software
and programs used for the compilation or printout thereof; and (ii) in connection with the Collateral Agents exercise of its rights or remedies under this Section 8.1 (including in order to take possession of,
collect, receive, assemble, process, appropriate, remove, realize upon, sell, assign, license out, convey, transfer or grant options to purchase any Collateral), each Credit Partys rights under all licenses and all franchise Contracts inure to
the benefit of all Secured Parties. Each Credit Party shall retain the right to control the Collateral Agents use of its trade names and Trademarks and such trade names and Trademarks, together with the goodwill associated therewith, are and
remain the exclusive property of the Credit Parties, and any and all use of the same by the Collateral Agent shall inure to the benefit of the Credit Parties; 
(g) place a hold on any account maintained with the Collateral Agent or deliver a notice of exclusive control, any entitlement
order, or other directions or instructions pursuant to any Control Agreement or similar agreements providing control of any Collateral; 
(h) demand and receive possession of the Books of any Credit Party regarding Collateral; and 
(i) exercise all rights and remedies available to the Collateral Agent or any Lender under the Collateral Documents or any other Loan
Documents or at law or equity, including all remedies provided under the Code (including disposal of the Collateral pursuant to the terms thereof). 
Each of the Collateral Agent and Lender agrees that in connection with any foreclosure or other exercise of rights under this Agreement or any
other Loan Document with respect to any Intellectual Property included in the Collateral, the rights of the licensees under any license of such Intellectual Property will not be terminated, limited or

  -43- 





otherwise adversely affected so long as no default exists thereunder in a way that would permit the licensor to terminate such license (commonly termed a
non-disturbance). Without limitation to any other provision herein or in any other Loan Document, while an Event of Default occurs and continues, at the Collateral Agents or the Required Lenders
request, representatives from Borrower and the Collateral Agent shall promptly meet (in person or telephonically) to discuss in good faith how to collect, receive, appropriate and realize upon Borrowers rights and interests in, to and under
any Current Company IP Agreement, including in connection with any foreclosure or other exercise of the Collateral Agents or any Lenders rights with respect thereto. If Borrower and the Collateral Agent do not mutually agree with respect
thereto within ten (10) Business Days after such request by the Collateral Agent (or such later date as agreed by the Collateral Agent), then the Collateral Agent may request Borrower to, and Borrower (promptly following the receipt of such
request) shall, use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the written consent of any counterparty to the exercise by the Collateral Agent or any Lender of any and all rights and remedies under this Agreement or any other Loan Document with
respect to any Current Company IP Agreement, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent.  8.2. Power
of Attorney. Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints the Collateral Agent and any Related Party thereof as its lawful attorney-in-fact, exercisable upon the occurrence
and during the continuance of an Event of Default, to: (a) endorse Borrowers name on any checks or other forms of payment or security; (b) sign Borrowers name on any invoice or bill of lading for any Account or drafts against
Account Debtors; (c) settle and adjust disputes and claims about the Collateral Accounts directly with depository banks where the Collateral Accounts are maintained, for amounts and on terms the Collateral Agent determines reasonable;
(d) make, settle, and adjust all claims under Borrowers products liability or general liability insurance policies maintained in the United States regarding Collateral; (e) pay, contest or settle any Lien, charge, encumbrance,
security interest, and adverse claim in or to the Collateral, or any judgment based thereon, or otherwise take any action to terminate or discharge the same; and (f) transfer the Collateral into the name of the Collateral Agent or a third party
as the Code permits. Borrower hereby appoints the Collateral Agent and any Related Party thereof as its lawful attorney-in-fact to file or record any documents necessary
to perfect or continue the perfection of the Collateral Agents security interest, for the benefit of Lenders and the other Secured Parties, in the Collateral regardless of whether an Event of Default has occurred until all Obligations (other
than contingent indemnification obligations to the extent no claim giving rise thereto has been asserted) have been satisfied in full and no Lender is under any further obligation to make Credit Extensions hereunder. The foregoing appointment of the
Collateral Agent and any Related Party thereof as Borrowers attorney in fact, and all of the Collateral Agents (or such Related Partys) rights and powers, coupled with an interest, are irrevocable until all Obligations (other than
contingent indemnification obligations to the extent no claim giving rise thereto has been asserted) have been fully repaid and performed and each Lenders obligation to provide Credit Extensions terminates. 
8.3. Application of Payments and Proceeds Upon Default. If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Collateral
Agent shall apply any funds in its possession, whether from Borrower account balances, payments, proceeds realized as the result of any collection of Collateral Accounts or disposition of any other Collateral, or otherwise, to the Obligations in
such order as the Collateral Agent shall determine in its sole discretion. Any surplus shall be paid to Borrower or other Persons legally entitled thereto; Borrower shall remain liable to Lenders for any deficiency. If the Collateral Agent or any
Lender directly or indirectly enters into a deferred payment or other credit transaction with any purchaser at any sale of Collateral, the Collateral Agent or such Lender, as applicable, shall have the option, exercisable at any time, of either
reducing the Obligations by the principal amount of the purchase price or deferring the reduction of the Obligations until the actual receipt by the applicable Lender(s) of cash therefor. 
8.4. Collateral Agents Liability for Collateral. So long as the Collateral Agent complies with Requirements
of Law regarding the safekeeping of the Collateral in the possession or under the control of the Collateral Agent, the Collateral Agent shall not be liable or responsible for: (a) the safekeeping of the Collateral; (b) any loss or damage
to the Collateral; or (c) any act or default of any other Person. In no event shall the Collateral Agent or any Lender have any liability for any diminution in the value of the Collateral for any reason. Borrower bears all risk of loss, damage
or destruction of the Collateral.  8.5. No Waiver; Remedies Cumulative. The Collateral Agents or any Lenders
failure, at any time or times, to require strict performance by Borrower or any other Person of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall not waive, affect, or diminish any right of the Collateral Agent or any Lender
thereafter to demand strict performance and compliance herewith or therewith. No waiver hereunder shall be effective unless signed by the party granting the waiver and then is only effective for the specific instance and purpose for which it is

  -44- 





given. Each of the Collateral Agents and Lenders rights and remedies under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents are cumulative. Each of the Collateral Agent and Lenders has all
rights and remedies provided under the Code, by law, or in equity. The exercise by the Collateral Agent or any Lender of one right or remedy is not an election and shall not preclude the Collateral Agent or any Lender from exercising any other
remedy under this Agreement or other remedy available at law or in equity, and the waiver by the Collateral Agent or any Lender of any Event of Default is not a continuing waiver. The Collateral Agents or any Lenders delay in exercising
any remedy is not a waiver, election, or acquiescence.  8.6. Demand Waiver; Makewhole Amount; Prepayment Premium. Borrower
waives demand, notice of default or dishonor, notice of payment and nonpayment, notice of any default, nonpayment at maturity, release, compromise, settlement, extension, or renewal of accounts, documents, instruments, chattel paper, and guarantees
held by the Collateral Agent on which Borrower is liable. Borrower acknowledges and agrees that if the maturity of all Obligations shall be accelerated pursuant to Section 8.1(a) by reason of the occurrence of an Event of
Default, the applicable Makewhole Amount and Prepayment Premium that is payable pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and Section 2.2(f), as applicable, shall become due and payable by Borrower upon such
acceleration, whether such acceleration is automatic or is effected by the Collateral Agents or any Lenders declaration thereof, as provided in Section 8.1(a), and Borrower shall pay the applicable Makewhole
Amount and Prepayment Premium that is payable pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and Section 2.2(f), as applicable, as compensation to Lenders for the loss of its investment opportunity and not as a
penalty, and Borrower waives any right to object thereto in any voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceeding or otherwise.

OF LAW, VENUE, AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER  THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS, AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES
HERETO AND THERETO, SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. Each party hereto submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York sitting in New York

  -46- 





County, and of the United States District Court of the Southern District of New York, and any appellate court from any thereof, and agrees that all claims in respect of any such action,
litigation or proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York State court or, to the fullest extent permitted by Requirements of Law, in such Federal court; provided, however, that nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to
operate to preclude the Collateral Agent or any Lender from bringing suit or taking other legal action in any other jurisdiction to realize on the Collateral or any other security for the Obligations, or to enforce a judgment or other court order in
favor of the Collateral Agent or any Lender. Each Credit Party expressly submits and consents in advance to such jurisdiction in any action or suit commenced in any such court, and each Credit Party hereby waives any objection that it may have based
upon lack of personal jurisdiction, improper venue, or forum non conveniens and hereby consents to the granting of such legal or equitable relief as is deemed appropriate by such court. Each Credit Party hereby waives personal service of the
summons, complaints, and other process issued in such action or suit and agrees that service of such summons, complaints, and other process may be made by registered or certified mail addressed to such party at the address set forth in (or otherwise
provided in accordance with the terms of) Section 9 of this Agreement and that service so made shall be deemed completed upon the earlier to occur of such partys actual receipt thereof or three (3) days after
deposit in the U.S. mails, proper postage prepaid.  TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY REQUIREMENTS OF LAW, EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ITS RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL IN ANY CLAIM, SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING WITH RESPECT TO, OR DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREIN AND THEREIN OR RELATED HERETO OR THERETO (WHETHER FOUNDED IN CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO OTHER PARTY AND NO RELATED PARTY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT
SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS
SECTION 10 AND (C) HAS REVIEWED THIS WAIVER WITH ITS COUNSEL.  11 GENERAL
PROVISIONS  11.1. Successors and Assigns. 
(a) This Agreement binds and is for the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. 
(b) No Credit Party may transfer, pledge or assign this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any rights or obligations hereunder or
thereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender. Subject to Section 11.1(d), any Lender may at any time sell, transfer, assign or pledge this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any of its rights or
obligations hereunder or thereunder, or grant a participation in all or any part of, or any interest in, such Lenders obligations, rights or benefits under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, including with respect to any Term Loan
(or any portion thereof), to any other Lender, any Affiliate of any Lender or any third Person without Borrowers consent (any such sale, transfer, assignment, pledge or grant of a participation, a Lender Transfer);
provided, however, that no Lender may make a Lender Transfer to a Competitor of Borrower without Borrowers prior written consent except after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default.   (c) In the case of a Lender Transfer in the form of a participation granted by any
Lender to any third party, (i) such Lenders obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of its obligations hereunder,
(iii) Borrower shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement and (iv) any agreement or instrument pursuant to which such Lender sells such
participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, restatement, supplement or other modification hereto, in each case subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement. Borrower agrees that each participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.5 and 2.6 (subject to the requirements and limitations therein, including the requirements under Section 2.6(d) (it
being understood that the 
  -47- 





documentation required under Section 2.6(d) shall be delivered to the applicable Lender)) to the same extent as if it were a Person that had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to
clause (b) above; provided that, with respect to any participation, such participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 2.5 or 2.6 than the applicable Lender (i.e., the party that
participated the interest) would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent of any entitlement to receive a greater payment resulting from a Change in Law that occurs after such participant acquired the applicable participation. 
(d) The Collateral Agent shall record any Lender Transfer in the Note Register. Each Lender shall provide Borrower and the Collateral Agent
with written notice of a Lender Transfer delivered no later than five (5) Business Days prior to the date on which such Lender Transfer is consummated. If any Lender sells a participation, such Lender shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each participant and principal amounts (and stated interest) of each participants interest in the Term Loans or
other obligations under the Loan Documents (the Participant Register); provided, however, that such Lender shall have no obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity
of any participant or any information relating to a participants interest in any commitments, loans or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such
commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) or Proposed Section 1.163-5(b) of the
Treasury Regulations (or, in each case, any amended or successor version). The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Collateral Agent and each Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in
the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. 
(e) Any attempted transfer, pledge or assignment of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any rights or obligations hereunder or
thereunder in violation of this Section 11.1 shall be null and void and neither Borrower nor any transfer agent shall give any effect in the Note Register to such attempted transfer. 
11.2. Indemnification. 
(a) Borrower agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each of the Collateral Agent, Lenders and its and their respective Affiliates (and its or
their respective successors and assigns) and each manager, member, partner, controlling Person, director, officer, employee, agent or sub-agent, advisor and affiliate thereof (each such Person, an
Indemnified Person) from and against any and all Indemnified Liabilities; provided, however, that (i) Borrower shall have no obligation to any Indemnified Person hereunder with respect to any Indemnified
Liabilities to the extent such Indemnified Liabilities arise from the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of that Indemnified Person (or its Affiliates or controlling Persons or their respective directors, officers, managers, partners,
members, agents, sub-agents or advisors) , in each case, as determined by a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, (ii) Borrower shall
have no obligation to any Indemnified Person hereunder with respect to any Indemnified Liabilities if and to the extent such Indemnified Liabilities arise from a material breach of any obligation of such Indemnified Person hereunder, and
(iii) Borrower shall have no obligation to any Indemnified Person hereunder with respect to any Indemnified Liabilities if and to the extent such Indemnified Liabilities arise from any claim by one Indemnified Person against another Indemnified
Person that does not relate to any act or omission of Borrower or any other Credit Party, and (iv) no Credit Party shall be liable for any settlement of any claim or proceeding effected by any Indemnified Person without the prior written
consent of such Credit Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), but if settled with such consent or if there shall be a final judgment against an Indemnified Person, each of the Credit Parties shall, jointly
and severally with each other Credit Parties, indemnify and hold harmless such Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment in the manner set forth in this Agreement. This
Section 11.2(a) shall not apply with respect to Taxes other than any Taxes that represent liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, claims, costs, expenses and disbursements arising from any non-Tax claim.  (b) To the extent permitted by Requirements of Law, no party to this Agreement shall
assert, and each party to this Agreement hereby waives, any claim against any other party hereto (and its or their successors and assigns), and each manager, member, partner, controlling Person, director, officer, employee, agent or sub-agent, advisor and affiliate thereof, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) (whether or not the claim therefor is based on
contract, tort or duty imposed by any applicable legal requirement) arising out of, in connection with, arising out of, as a result of, or in any way related 
  -48- 





to, this Agreement or any Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby or referred to herein or therein, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, any Credit
Extension or the use of the proceeds thereof or any act or omission or event occurring in connection therewith, and each party to this Agreement hereby waives, releases and agrees not to sue upon any such claim or any such damages, whether or not
accrued and whether or not known or suspected to exist in its favor.  (c) Any action taken by any Credit Party under or with respect to
any Loan Document, even if required under any Loan Document or at the request of the Collateral Agent or any Lender, shall be at the expense of such Credit Party, and neither the Collateral Agent nor any Secured Party shall be required under any
Loan Document to reimburse any Credit Party or any Subsidiary of any Credit Party therefor except as expressly provided therein. In addition, and without limiting the generality of Section 2.4, Borrower agrees to pay or
reimburse upon demand each of the Collateral Agent and Lenders (and their respective successors and assigns) and each of their respective Related Parties, if applicable, for any and all reasonable and documented fees, expenses and disbursements of
the kind or nature described in clause (ii) of the definition of Lender Expenses incurred by it.  11.3.
Severability of Provisions. In case any provision in or obligation hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining
provisions or obligations, or of such provision or obligation in any other jurisdiction, shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. 
11.4. Correction of Loan Documents. The Collateral Agent or Required Lenders may correct patent errors and fill in any blanks in
the Loan Documents consistent with the agreement of the parties hereto so long as the Collateral Agent or Required Lenders, as applicable, provides the Credit Parties and the other parties hereto with written notice of such correction and allows the
Credit Parties at least ten (10) days to object to such correction in writing delivered to the Collateral Agent and each Lender. In the event of such objection, such correction shall not be made except by an amendment to this Agreement in
accordance with Section 11.5.  11.5. Amendments in Writing; Integration. 
(a) No amendment, restatement or modification of or supplement to any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or waiver,
discharge or termination of any obligation hereunder or thereunder, no approval or consent hereunder or thereunder (including any consent to any departure by Borrower or any other Credit Party herefrom or therefrom), shall in any event be effective
unless the same shall be in writing and signed by Borrower (on its own behalf and on behalf of each other Credit Party) and the Required Lenders; provided, however, that no such amendment, restatement, modification, supplement, waiver,
discharge, termination, approval or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by the Collateral Agent and the Required Lenders, affect the rights or duties of, or any amounts payable to, the Collateral Agent under this Agreement or any other Loan
Document. Any such waiver, approval or consent granted shall be limited to the specific circumstance expressly described in it, and shall not apply to any subsequent or other circumstance, whether similar or dissimilar, or give rise to, or evidence,
any obligation or commitment to grant any further waiver, approval or consent.  (b) This Agreement and the Loan Documents represent the
entire agreement about this subject matter and supersede prior negotiations or agreements. All prior agreements, understandings, representations, warranties, and negotiations among the parties hereto about the subject matter of this Agreement and
the Loan Documents merge into this Agreement and the Loan Documents.  11.6. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in
any number of counterparts and by different parties on separate counterparts, each of which, when executed and delivered, is an original, and all taken together, constitute one Agreement. 
11.7. Survival. Termination Prior to Term Loan Maturity Date. All covenants, representations and warranties made in this
Agreement continue in full force until this Agreement has terminated pursuant to this Section 11.17 and all Obligations (other than contingent indemnification obligations to the extent no claim giving rise thereto has been
asserted and any other obligations which, by their terms, are to survive the termination of this Agreement) have been paid in full and satisfied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The obligation of Borrower or any other the Credit
Parties in Section 11.2 to indemnify Indemnified Persons shall survive until the statute of 
  -49- 





limitations with respect to such claim or cause of action shall have run. So long all Obligations (other than contingent indemnification obligations to the extent no claim giving rise thereto has
been asserted and any other obligations which, by their terms, are to survive the termination of this Agreement and for which no claim has been made) have been paid in full and satisfied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, this Agreement
shall be terminated (a) prior to the Term Loan Maturity Date by Borrower, effective five (5) Business Days after written notice of termination is delivered to the Collateral Agent and the Lenders, or (b) if no such notice is
delivered, automatically on the Term Loan Maturity Date.  11.8. Confidentiality. Any information regarding the Credit
Parties and their Subsidiaries and their businesses provided to the Collateral Agent or any Lender by or on behalf of any Credit Party pursuant to the Loan Documents shall be deemed Confidential Information; provided, however, that
Confidential Information does not include information that is either: (i) in the public domain or in the possession of the Collateral Agent, any Lender or any of their respective Affiliates or when disclosed to the Collateral Agent, any Lender
or any of their respective Affiliates, or becomes part of the public domain after disclosure to the Collateral Agent, any Lender or any of their respective Affiliates, in each case, other than as a result of a breach by the Collateral Agent, any
Lender or any of their respective Affiliates of the obligations under this Section 11.8; or (ii) disclosed to the Collateral Agent, any Lender or any of their respective Affiliates by a third party if the Collateral
Agent, such Lender or such Affiliate, as applicable, does not know (following due and careful enquiry) that the third party is prohibited from disclosing the information. Neither the Collateral Agent nor any Lender shall disclose any Confidential
Information to a third party or use Confidential Information for any purpose other than the exercise of its rights and the performance of its duties or obligations under the Loan Documents. The foregoing in this
Section 11.8 notwithstanding, the Collateral Agent and each Lender may disclose Confidential Information: (a) to any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates; (b) to prospective transferees, purchasers or participants of
any interest in the Term Loans (including, for the avoidance of doubt, in connection with any proposed Lender Transfer), provided that no such disclosure to any Competitors shall be permitted hereunder without Borrowers prior written
consent (which such consent shall not be required after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default; (c) as required by law, regulation, subpoena, or other order, provided, that (x) prior to any disclosure under
this clause (c), the Collateral Agent or such Lender, as applicable, agrees to provide Borrower with prior written notice thereof and with respect to any law, regulation, subpoena or other order, to the extent that the Collateral Agent or
such Lender is permitted to provide such prior notice to Borrower pursuant to the terms hereof, and (y) any disclosure under this clause (c) shall be limited solely to that portion of the Confidential Information as may be
specifically compelled by such law, regulation, subpoena or other order; (d) to the extent requested by regulators having jurisdiction over the Collateral Agent or such Lender or as otherwise required in connection with the Collateral
Agents or such Lenders examination or audit by such regulators; (e) as the Collateral Agent or such Lender considers reasonably necessary in exercising remedies under the Loan Documents in accordance with
Section 8.1; (f) to third-party service providers of the Collateral Agent or such Lender; and (g) to any of the Collateral Agents or such Lenders Related Parties; provided, however, that the
third parties to which Confidential Information is disclosed pursuant to clauses (a), (b), (f) and (g) are bound by obligations of confidentiality and non-use that are no less

Right of Set-Off. In addition to any rights now or hereafter granted under Requirements of Law and not by way of limitation of any such rights, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default and at any time
thereafter during the continuance of any Event of Default, each Lender is hereby authorized by each Credit Party at any time or from time to time, without prior notice to any Credit Party, any such notice being hereby expressly waived by Borrower
(on its own behalf and on behalf of each other Credit Party), to set off and to appropriate and to apply any and all deposits (general or special, including Indebtedness evidenced by certificates of deposit, whether matured or unmatured, but not
including trust accounts) and any other Indebtedness at any time held or owing by such Lender to or for the credit or the account of any Credit Party against and on account of the obligations and liabilities of any Credit Party to such Lender

  -50- 





description arising out of or connected hereto or with any other Loan Document, irrespective of whether or not (a) the Collateral Agent or such Lender shall have made any demand hereunder or
(b) the principal of or the interest on the Term Loans or any other amounts due hereunder shall have become due and payable pursuant to Section 2 and although such obligations and liabilities, or any of them, may be
contingent or unmatured. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify Borrower and the Collateral Agent after any such set off and application made by such Lender; provided, that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set off
and application.  11.11. Marshalling; Payments Set Aside. Neither the Collateral Agent nor any Lender shall be under any
obligation to marshal any assets in favor of any Credit Party or any other Person or against or in payment of any or all of the Obligations. To the extent that any Credit Party makes a payment or payments to any Lender, or the Collateral Agent or

required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party under any bankruptcy law, any other state or federal law, common law or any equitable cause, then, to the extent of such recovery, the obligation or part thereof originally intended to
be satisfied, and all Liens, rights and remedies therefor or related thereto, shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment or payments had not been made or such enforcement or setoff had not occurred.

mutually acknowledge that they and their respective attorneys have participated in the preparation and negotiation of this Agreement. In cases of uncertainty, this Agreement shall be construed without regard to which of the parties hereto caused the
uncertainty to exist.  11.15. Third Parties. Nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied, is intended to:

permitted assigns; (b) relieve or discharge the obligation or liability of any Person not an express party to this Agreement; or (c) give any Person not an express party to this Agreement any right of subrogation or action against any
party to this Agreement.  11.16. No Advisory or Fiduciary Duty. The Collateral Agent and each Lender may have economic
interests that conflict with those of the Credit Parties. Each Credit Party agrees that nothing in the Loan Documents or otherwise will be deemed to create an advisory, fiduciary or agency relationship or fiduciary or other implied duty between any
Lender or the Collateral Agent, on the one hand, and such Credit Party, its Subsidiaries, and any of their respective stockholders or affiliates, on the other hand. Each Credit Party acknowledges and agrees that (i) the transactions
contemplated by the Loan Documents are arms-length commercial transactions between each Lender and the Collateral Agent, on the one hand, and such Credit Party, its Subsidiaries and their respective
affiliates, on the other hand, (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading to such transaction, the Collateral Agent and each Lender is acting solely as a principal and not the advisor, agent or fiduciary of such Credit Party, its
Subsidiaries or their respective affiliates, management, stockholders, creditors or any other Person, (iii) neither the Collateral Agent nor any Lender has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of any Credit Party, its
Subsidiaries or their respective affiliates with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether the Collateral Agent or any Lender or any of their respective affiliates has advised or is
currently advising such Credit Party, its Subsidiaries or their respective affiliates on other matters) or any other obligation to such Credit Party, its Subsidiaries or their respective affiliates except the obligations expressly set forth in the
Loan Documents, and (iv) each Credit Party, its Subsidiaries and their respective affiliates have consulted their own legal and financial advisors to the extent each deemed appropriate. Each Credit Party further acknowledges and agrees that it
is responsible for making its own independent judgment with respect to such transactions and the process leading thereto. Each Credit Party agrees that it will not claim that the Collateral Agent or any Lender has rendered advisory services of any
nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to such Credit Party, its Subsidiaries or their respective affiliates in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.

sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Collateral Agent and any such sub-agent. The Collateral Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of

have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days after the retiring Collateral Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Collateral Agent may, on behalf of the
Lenders, appoint a successor Collateral Agent that is a Related Party of the Collateral Agent or any Lender; provided, that, whether or not a successor has been appointed or has accepted such appointment, such resignation shall become

agreements in connection with the licensing of Intellectual Property permitted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement; and  (e) to enter

items of property, or to release any Guarantor) from its obligations under each Collateral Document pursuant to this Section 12.8.

Section 12.8 and in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Collateral Agent.  Without limiting the generality of
Section 12.10 below, the Collateral Agent shall deliver to the Lenders notice of any action taken by it under this Section 12.8 promptly after the taking thereof; provided that delivery of
or failure to deliver any such notice shall not affect the Collateral Agents rights, powers, privileges and protections under this Section 12. 
12.9. Reimbursement by Lenders. To the extent that Borrower for any reason fails to indefeasibly pay any amount required under
Section 2.4 to be paid by it to the Collateral Agent (or any sub-agent thereof) or any Related Party of any of the foregoing, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Collateral
Agent (or any such sub-agent) or such Related Party, as the case may be, such Lenders pro rata share (based upon the percentages as used in determining the Required Lenders as of the time that the
applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount; provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against
the Collateral Agent (or any such sub-agent) in its capacity as such or against any Related Party of any of the foregoing acting for the Collateral Agent (or any
sub-agent) in connection with such capacity.  12.10. Notices and Items to Lenders.
The Collateral Agent shall deliver to the Lenders each notice, report, statement, approval, direction, consent, exemption, authorization, waiver, certificate, filing or other item received by it pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document
(including any item received by it pursuant to Section 3 or set forth on Schedule 5.14 of the Disclosure Letter); provided, that any delivery of or failure to deliver any such notice, report, statement, approval,
direction, consent, exemption, authorization, waiver, certificate, filing or item shall not otherwise alter or effect the rights of the Lenders or the Collateral Agent under this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the validity of such item. In
addition, to the extent the Collateral Agent or the Required Lenders deliver any notices, approvals, authorizations, directions, consents or waivers to Borrower pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document, the Collateral Agent or the
Required Lenders, as applicable, will also deliver such notice, approval, authorization, direction, consent or waiver to the other Lenders on or about the same time such notice, approval, authorization, direction, consent or waiver is provided to
Borrower; provided, that the delivery of or failure to deliver such notice, approval, authorization, direction, consent or waiver to the other Lenders shall not in any way effect the obligations of Borrower, or the rights of the Collateral Agent or
