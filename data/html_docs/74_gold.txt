(b)           Notice of Borrowing.  Each request for a Borrowing (other than a Continuation or Conversion) shall be made by an Authorized Officer of the Borrower by delivering written notice of such request substantially in the form of Exhibit B-1 hereto (each such notice, a Notice of Borrowing) or by telephone (to be confirmed promptly (and in any event on the day of such telephonic notice) in writing by delivery by an Authorized Officer of the Borrower of a Notice of Borrowing), and in any event each such request shall be irrevocable and shall specify (i) the aggregate principal amount of the Loans to be made pursuant to such Borrowing, (ii) the date of the Borrowing (which shall be a Business Day), (iii) the Type of Loans such Borrowing will consist of, and (iv) if applicable, the initial Interest Period.  Without in any way limiting the obligation of the Borrower to confirm in writing any telephonic notice permitted to be given hereunder, the Administrative Agent may act prior to receipt of written confirmation without liability upon the basis of such telephonic notice believed by the Administrative Agent in good faith to be from an Authorized Officer of the Borrower entitled to give telephonic notices under this Agreement on behalf of the Borrower.  In each such case, the Administrative Agents record of the terms of such telephonic notice shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

Section 2.07                  Funding Obligations; Disbursement of Funds.
 
(a)           Several Nature of Funding Obligations.  The Commitments of each Lender hereunder and the obligation of each Lender to make Loans and acquire and fund LC Participations are several and not joint obligations.  No Lender shall be responsible for any default by any other Lender in its obligation to make Loans or fund any participation hereunder and each Lender shall be obligated to make the Loans provided to be made by it and fund its participations required to be funded by it hereunder, regardless of the failure of any other Lender to fulfill any of its Commitments hereunder.  Nothing herein and no subsequent termination of the Commitments pursuant to Section 2.12 shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill its commitments hereunder and in existence from time to time or to prejudice any rights that the Borrower may have against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder.
 
(b)           Borrowings Pro Rata.  All Loans hereunder shall be made as follows:  (i) all Revolving Loans made, and LC Participations acquired by each Lender, shall be made or acquired, as the case may be, on a pro rata basis based upon each Lenders Revolving Facility Percentage of the amount of such Revolving Borrowing or Letter of Credit in effect on the date the applicable Revolving Borrowing is to be made or the Letter of Credit is to be issued; and (ii) all Term Loans shall be made by the Lenders having Term Commitments pro rata on the basis of their respective Term Commitments.
 
(c)           Notice to Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall promptly give each Lender, as applicable, written notice (or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing) of each proposed Borrowing, or Conversion or Continuation thereof, and LC Issuance, and of such Lenders proportionate
 
60





 
share thereof or participation therein and of the other matters covered by the Notice of Borrowing, Notice of Continuation or Conversion, or LC Request, as the case may be, relating thereto.
 
(d)           Funding of Loans.  No later than 2:00 P.M. (local time at the Payment Office) on the date specified in each Notice of Borrowing, each Lender will make available its amount, if any, of each Borrowing requested to be made on such date to the Administrative Agent at the Payment Office in Dollars and in immediately available funds and the Administrative Agent promptly will make available to the Borrower by depositing to its account at the Payment Office (or such other account as the Borrower shall specify) the aggregate of the amounts so made available in the type of funds received.
 
(e)           Advance Funding.  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified by any Lender prior to the date of Borrowing that such Lender does not intend to make available to the Administrative Agent its portion of the Borrowing or Borrowings to be made on such date, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such amount available to the Administrative Agent on such date of Borrowing, and the Administrative Agent, in reliance upon such assumption, may (in its sole discretion and without any obligation to do so) make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount.  If such corresponding amount is not in fact made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender and the Administrative Agent has made the same available to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such corresponding amount from such Lender.  If such Lender does not pay such corresponding amount forthwith upon the Administrative Agents demand therefor, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower, and the Borrower shall immediately pay such corresponding amount to the Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover from such Lender or the Borrower, as the case may be, interest on such corresponding amount in respect of each day from the date such corresponding amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower to the date such corresponding amount is recovered by the Administrative Agent at a rate per annum equal to (i) if paid by such Lender, the overnight Federal Funds Effective Rate or (ii) if paid by the Borrower, the then applicable rate of interest, calculated in accordance with Section 2.09, for the respective Loans (but without any requirement to pay any amounts in respect thereof pursuant to Section 3.02).
 
Section 2.08                  Evidence of Obligations.
 
(a)           Loan Accounts of Lenders.  Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the Obligations of the Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.
 
(b)           Loan Accounts of Administrative Agent; Lender Register.  The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall record: (i) the amount of each Loan and Borrowing made hereunder, the Type thereof, the currency in which such Loan is denominated, the Interest Period and applicable interest rate; (ii) the amount and other details with respect to each Letter of Credit issued hereunder; (iii) the amount of any principal due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder; (iv) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lenders share thereof; and (v) the other details relating to the Loans, Letters of Credit and other Obligations.  In addition, the Administrative Agent shall maintain a register (the Lender Register) on or in which it will record the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts (and stated interest) of the Loan owing to, each Lender, pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time.  The entries in the Lender Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Lender Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender for
 
61





 
all purposes of this Agreement.  The Administrative Agent will make the Lender Register available to any Lender or the Borrower, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
 
(c)           Effect of Loan Accounts, etc.  The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to Section 2.08(b) shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the Obligations recorded therein; provided, that the failure of the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error (other than manifest error) therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of any Credit Party to repay or prepay the Loans or the other Obligations in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
 
(d)           Notes.  Upon request of any Lender, the Borrower will execute and deliver to such Lender (i) a Revolving Facility Note with blanks appropriately completed in conformity herewith to evidence the Borrowers obligation to pay the principal of, and interest on, the Revolving Loans made to it by such Lender and (ii) a Term Note with blanks appropriately completed in conformity herewith to evidence its obligation to pay the principal of, and interest on, the Term Loan made to it by such Lender; provided, however, that the decision of any Lender to not request a Note shall in no way detract from the Borrowers obligation to repay the Loans and other amounts owing by the Borrower to such Lender.

(a)           Interest on Revolving Loans.  The outstanding principal amount of each Revolving Loan made by each Lender shall bear interest at a fluctuating rate per annum that shall at all times be equal to (i) during such periods as such Revolving Loan is a Base Rate Loan, the Base Rate plus the Applicable Revolving Loan Margin in effect from time to time and (ii) during such periods as such Revolving Loan is a Eurodollar Loan, the relevant Adjusted Eurodollar Rate for such Eurodollar Loan for the applicable Interest Period plus the Applicable Revolving Loan Margin in effect from time to time.

(vii)         Certain Proceeds of an Event of Loss.  If during any fiscal year of the Borrower, any Credit Party has received cumulative Net Cash Proceeds during such fiscal year from one or more Events of Loss (excluding insurance payments in connection with business interruption or delays in construction) of at least $10,000,000, not later than the fifth (5th) Business Day following the date of receipt of any Net Cash Proceeds in excess of such amount, the Borrower will make a prepayment of the Loans with an amount equal to 100% of the Net Cash Proceeds then received in excess of such amount from any Event of Loss in accordance with Section 2.13(d) below.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event any property suffers an Event of Loss and (A) no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and (B) the Borrower notifies the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in writing that it intends to repair, rebuild or restore the affected property, that such repair, rebuilding or restoration can be accomplished within 365 days out of such Net Cash Proceeds and other funds available to the Borrower or, if the Borrower has entered into a legally binding commitment to repair, rebuild or restore the affected property within 365 days of receipt of such Cash Proceeds, that such repair, rebuilding or restoration can be accomplished within 180 days of the date of such legally binding commitment, then no such prepayment of the Loans shall be required.   If by the deadline specified in clause (B) above, any portion of such Net Cash Proceeds from Events of Loss has not been so used to repair, rebuild or restore the affected property, the Borrower will immediately make a prepayment of the Loans, to the extent required above.  Any amounts not so applied to the costs of rebuilding or restoration shall be applied to the prepayment of the Loans as provided in Section 2.13(d) below.
 
68





 
(d)           Applications of Certain Prepayment Proceeds.  Each prepayment required to be made pursuant to Sections Section 2.13(c)(iv), (v), (vi) or (vii) above shall be applied as a mandatory prepayment of principal of first, the outstanding Term Loans, with such amounts being applied to the next eight Scheduled Repayments thereof in direct order and thereafter to the remaining Scheduled Repayments on a pro rata basis, and second, the outstanding Revolving Loans (but without any corresponding reduction in Revolving Commitments), and the LC Outstandings shall be Cash Collateralized to the extent required by Section 2.12(b).
 
(e)           Particular Loans to be Prepaid.  With respect to each repayment or prepayment of Loans made or required by this Section, the Borrower shall designate the Types of Loans that are to be repaid or prepaid and the specific Borrowing(s) pursuant to which such repayment or prepayment is to be made; provided, however, that (i) the Borrower shall first so designate all Loans that are Base Rate Loans and Eurodollar Loans with Interest Periods ending on the date of repayment or prepayment prior to designating any other Eurodollar Loans for repayment or prepayment, and (ii) if the outstanding principal amount of Eurodollar Loans made pursuant to a Borrowing is reduced below the applicable Minimum Borrowing Amount as a result of any such repayment or prepayment, then all the Loans outstanding pursuant to such Borrowing shall, in the case of Eurodollar Loans, be Converted into Base Rate Loans.  In the absence of a designation by the Borrower as described in the preceding sentence, the Administrative Agent shall, subject to the above, make such designation in its sole discretion with a view, but no obligation, to minimize breakage costs owing under Article III.
 
(f)            Constraints on Upstreaming.  The mandatory prepayments of the Borrower pursuant to Sections Section 2.13(c)(iv), (vi) and (vii) of this Agreement shall not be required to the extent and for so long as the repatriation of funds from the Borrowers Non-U.S. Subsidiaries would be required to effect such prepayments and could reasonably be expected to (i) cause the Borrower or its Non-U.S. Subsidiaries to suffer material adverse costs or tax consequences (including the imposition of withholding taxes), (ii) result in a violation of applicable local law or (iii) expose individual directors of the Borrower or any Non-U.S. Subsidiary to the risk of personal liability, in each case as reasonably determined by Borrower in good faith.  The Borrower and its Non-U.S. Subsidiaries, if any, will undertake to take all commercially reasonable actions to overcome or eliminate any such restrictions and/or minimize any such costs of prepayment to make the relevant prepayment.  If at a later date the Borrower or any of its Non-U.S. Subsidiaries is able to repatriate all or any portion of such funds in order to make such mandatory prepayment without incurring a material risk of suffering a material adverse cost or tax consequence, it shall promptly take all such actions necessary to repatriate such funds and make such mandatory prepayment.
 
(g)           Call Protection.  In the event that any Repricing Event occurs on or prior to the six-month anniversary of the Closing Date, the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Term Lenders holding Term Loans advanced on the Closing Date or otherwise entitled to the benefits of this Section 2.13(g), concurrently with such Repricing Event, a premium in an amount equal to 1.00% of the outstanding principal amount of the Term Loans subject to such Repricing Event.
 
(h)           Breakage and Other Compensation.  Any prepayment made pursuant to this Section 2.13 shall be accompanied by any amounts payable in respect thereof under Article III hereof.
 
(i)            Waivable Mandatory Prepayment.  Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, so long as any Term Loans are outstanding, if the Borrower is required to make any mandatory prepayment pursuant to Sections Section 2.13(c)(iv), (v), (vi) or (vii) (a Waivable Mandatory Prepayment), not less than three Business Days prior to the date (the Required Prepayment Date) on which the Borrower is required to make such Waivable Mandatory Prepayment, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of the amount of such prepayment, and the Administrative Agent will promptly
 
69





 
thereafter notify each Lender holding outstanding Term Loans of the amount of such Lenders pro rata share of such Waivable Mandatory Prepayment and such Lenders option to refuse such amount (but in the case of mandatory prepayments under Section 2.13(c)(vi), solely to the extent that such prepayment does not represent a refinancing of the Term Loans).  Each such Lender may exercise such option by giving written notice to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of its election to do so on or before the first Business Day prior to the Required Prepayment Date (it being understood that any Lender which does not notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of its election to exercise such option on or before the first Business Day prior to the Required Prepayment Date shall be deemed to have elected, as of such date, not to exercise such option).  On the Required Prepayment Date, the Borrower shall retain that amount of the Waivable Mandatory Prepayment with respect to which each Lender, if any, shall have exercised its option to refuse (any such amount retained by the Borrower, the Retained Declined Proceeds).
 
Section 2.14                  Method and Place of Payment.
 
(a)           Generally.  All payments made by the Borrower hereunder (including any payments made with respect to the Borrower Guaranteed Obligations under Article X) under any Note or any other Loan Document shall be made without setoff, counterclaim or other defense.
 
(b)           Application of Payments.  Except as specifically set forth elsewhere in this Agreement and subject to Section 8.03, (i) all payments and prepayments of Revolving Loans and Unpaid Drawings with respect to Letters of Credit shall be applied by the Administrative Agent on a pro rata basis based upon each Lenders Revolving Facility Percentage of the amount of such prepayment, and (ii) all payments and prepayments of Term Loans shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reduce the principal amount of the Term Loans made by each Lender with a Term Commitment, pro rata on the basis of their respective Term Commitments.
 
(c)           Payment of Obligations.  Except as specifically set forth elsewhere in this Agreement, all payments under this Agreement with respect to any of the Obligations shall be made to the Administrative Agent on the date when due and shall be made at the Payment Office in immediately available funds and, except as set forth in the next sentence, shall be made in Dollars.
 
(d)           Timing of Payments.  Any payments under this Agreement that are made later than 11:00 A.M. (local time at the Payment Office) shall be deemed to have been made on the next succeeding Business Day.  Whenever any payment to be made hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the due date thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and, with respect to payments of principal, interest shall be payable during such extension at the applicable rate in effect immediately prior to such extension.
 
(e)           Distribution to Lenders.  Upon the Administrative Agents receipt of payments hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall immediately distribute to each Lender or the applicable LC Issuer, as the case may be, its ratable share, if any, of the amount of principal, interest, and Fees received by it for the account of such Lender.  Payments received by the Administrative Agent in Dollars shall be delivered to the Lenders or the applicable LC Issuer, as the case may be, in Dollars in immediately available funds; provided, however, that if at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, Unpaid Drawings, interest and Fees then due hereunder then, except as specifically set forth elsewhere in this Agreement and subject to Section 8.03, such funds shall be applied, first, towards payment of interest and Fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and Fees then due to such parties, and second, towards payment of principal and Unpaid Drawings then due hereunder, ratably
 
70





 
among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and Unpaid Drawings then due to such parties.
 
Section 2.15                  Defaulting Lenders.
 
(a)           Defaulting Lender Adjustments.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as such Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable law:
 
(i)            Waivers and Amendments.  Such Defaulting Lenders right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in the definition of Required Lenders and Required Revolving Lenders.
 
(ii)           Defaulting Lender Waterfall. Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Article VIII or otherwise) or received by the Administrative Agent from a Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 11.03 shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder; second, to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to any LC Issuer hereunder; third, to Cash Collateralize the LC Issuers Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender in accordance with Section 2.16; fourth, as the Borrower may request (so long as no Default or Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent; fifth, if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to be held in a deposit account and released pro rata in order to (x) satisfy such Defaulting Lenders potential future funding obligations with respect to Loans under this Agreement and (y) Cash Collateralize the LC Issuers future Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender with respect to future Letters of Credit issued under this Agreement, in accordance with Section 2.16; sixth, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders or the LC Issuers as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender or the LC Issuers against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement; seventh, so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and eighth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans or reimbursement of any payment on any Letter of Credit in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share, and (y) such Loans or reimbursement of any payment on any Letter of Credit were made or the related Letters of Credit were issued at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of, and LC Outstandings owed to, all Non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of, or LC Outstandings owed to, such Defaulting Lender until such time as all Loans and funded and unfunded participations in LC Outstandings are held by the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the Commitments under the applicable Credit Facilities without giving effect to Section 2.15(a)(iv). Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section 2.15(a)(ii) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.
 
71





 
(iii)          Certain Fees.  (A) No Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive any Commitment Fee for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and the Borrower shall not be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender).
 
(B)          Each Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive LC Fees for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender only to the extent allocable to its Revolving Facility Percentage of the stated amount of Letters of Credit for which it has provided Cash Collateral pursuant to Section 2.16.
 
(C)          With respect to any LC Fee not required to be paid to any Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (B) above, the Borrower shall (x) pay to each Non-Defaulting Lender that portion of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender with respect to such Defaulting Lenders participation in LC Outstandings that has been reallocated to such Non-Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (iv) below, (y) pay to each LC Issuer, as applicable, the amount of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender to the extent allocable to such LC Issuers Fronting Exposure to such Defaulting Lender, and (z) not be required to pay the remaining amount of any such fee.
 
(iv)          Reallocation of Participations to Reduce Fronting Exposure.  All or any part of such Defaulting Lenders participation in LC Outstandings shall be reallocated among the Non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Revolving Facility Percentages (calculated without regard to such Defaulting Lenders Commitment) but only to the extent that (x) the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 are satisfied at the time of such reallocation (and, unless the Borrower shall have otherwise notified the Administrative Agent at such time, the Borrower shall be deemed to have represented and warranted that such conditions are satisfied at such time), and (y) such reallocation does not cause the aggregate Revolving Facility Exposure of any Non-Defaulting Lender to exceed such Non-Defaulting Lenders Revolving Commitment.  No reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a Non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such Non-Defaulting Lenders increased exposure following such reallocation.
 
(v)           Cash Collateral.  If the reallocation described in clause (iv) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrower shall, without prejudice to any right or remedy available to it hereunder or under law, Cash Collateralize the LC Issuers Fronting Exposure in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.16.
 
(b)           Defaulting Lender Cure.  If the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and each LC Issuer agree in writing that a Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any Cash Collateral), that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit to be held pro rata by the Lenders in accordance with the Commitments under the applicable Credit Facility (without giving effect to Section 2.15(a)(a)(iv), whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to
 
72





 
Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lenders having been a Defaulting Lender.
 
(c)           New Letters of Credit.  So long as any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, no LC Issuer shall be required to issue, extend, renew or increase any Letter of Credit unless it is satisfied that it will have no Fronting Exposure after giving effect thereto.
 
Section 2.16                  Cash Collateral.
 
(a)           At any time that there shall exist a Defaulting Lender, within three Business Days following the written request of the Administrative Agent or any LC Issuer (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) the Borrower shall Cash Collateralize the LC Issuers Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender (determined after giving effect to Section 2.15(a)(iv) and any Cash Collateral provided by such Defaulting Lender) in an amount not less than the Minimum Collateral Amount.
 
(b)           Grant of Security Interest.  The Borrower, and to the extent provided by any Defaulting Lender, such Defaulting Lender, hereby grants to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the LC Issuers, and agrees to maintain, a first priority security interest in all such Cash Collateral as security for the Defaulting Lenders obligation to fund participations in respect of LC Outstandings, to be applied pursuant to clause (c) below.  If at any time the Administrative Agent determines that Cash Collateral is subject to any right or claim of any Person other than the Administrative Agent and the LC Issuers as herein provided, or that the total amount of such Cash Collateral is less than the Minimum Collateral Amount, the Borrower will, promptly upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay or provide to the Administrative Agent additional Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to eliminate such deficiency (after giving effect to any Cash Collateral provided by the Defaulting Lender).
 
(c)           Application.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Cash Collateral provided under this Section 2.16 or  Section 2.15  in respect of Letters of Credit shall be applied to the satisfaction of the Defaulting Lenders obligation to fund participations in respect of L/C Outstandings (including, as to Cash Collateral provided by a Defaulting Lender, any interest accrued on such obligation) for which the Cash Collateral was so provided, prior to any other application of such property as may otherwise be provided for herein.
 
(d)           Termination of Requirement.  Cash Collateral (or the appropriate portion thereof) provided to reduce any LC Issuers Fronting Exposure shall no longer be required to be held as Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section 2.16 following (i) the elimination of the applicable Fronting Exposure (including by the termination of Defaulting Lender status of the applicable Lender), or (ii) the determination by the Administrative Agent and each LC Issuer that there exists excess Cash Collateral; provided that, subject to  Section 2.15, the Person providing Cash Collateral and each LC Issuer may agree that Cash Collateral shall be held to support future anticipated Fronting Exposure or other obligations and provided, further that to the extent that such Cash Collateral was provided by the Borrower, such Cash Collateral shall remain subject to the security interest granted pursuant to the Loan Documents.
 
Section 2.17                  Increase in Commitments.
 
(a)           The Borrower may, by written notice to the Administrative Agent at any time after the Closing Date, request on one or more occasions Incremental Term Loan Commitments and/or Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed the Incremental Facility Maximum Amount from one or more Incremental Term Lenders or Incremental

Revolving Credit Lenders, as applicable, which may include any existing Lender (each of which shall be entitled to agree or decline to participate in its sole discretion, provided, that if any such existing Lender does not respond to such written notice within five (5) Business Days, such Lender shall be deemed to have declined to participate therein); provided, that each Incremental Term Lender and Incremental Revolving Credit Lender, if not already a Lender hereunder, shall be subject to the approval of (i) the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), to the extent the Administrative Agent would be required to consent to the assignment of any Loans or Commitments to such Incremental Term Lender and Incremental Revolving Credit Lender pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) in connection with Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments only, each LC Issuer, to the extent such consent would have been required for assignments of any Revolving Loans or Revolving Commitments pursuant to this Agreement.  Such notice shall set forth (i) the amount of the Incremental Term Loan Commitments or the Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments being requested (which shall be in minimum increments of $1,000,000 and a minimum amount of $10,000,000), (ii) the date on which such Incremental Term Loan Commitments or Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments are requested to become effective (which shall not be less than 15 days nor more than 60 days after the date of such notice, unless otherwise agreed to by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion) and (iii) whether such Incremental Term Loan Commitments are to be Term Commitments or commitments to make term loans with terms different from the Term Loans (Other Term Loans).  Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, it is acknowledged and agreed that all Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments are to be Revolving Commitments and based on the terms and conditions set forth herein for Revolving Commitments and Revolving Loans.
 
(b)           The Borrower may seek Incremental Term Loan Commitments and Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments from existing Lenders (each of which shall be entitled to agree or decline to participate in its sole discretion, provided, that if any such existing Lender does not respond to any request for Incremental Term Loan Commitments and/or Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments within five (5) Business Days of request therefor, such Lender shall be deemed to have declined to participate therein) and additional banks, financial institutions and other institutional lenders who will become Incremental Term Lenders and/or Incremental Revolving Credit Lenders, as applicable, in connection therewith.  The Borrower and each Incremental Term Lender shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Incremental Term Loan Assumption Agreement and such other documentation as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably specify to evidence the Incremental Term Loan Commitment of such Incremental Term Lender.  The Borrower and each Incremental Revolving Credit Lender shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Incremental Revolving Credit Assumption Agreement and such other documentation as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably specify to evidence the Incremental Revolving Credit Commitment of such Incremental Revolving Credit Lender.  Each Incremental Term Loan Assumption Agreement and Incremental Revolving Credit Assumption Agreement shall specify the terms of the Incremental Term Loans or Incremental Revolving Loans, as applicable, to be made thereunder; provided, that (i) the final maturity date of any Other Term Loans shall be no earlier than the later of (X) the maturity date of the Term Loans made on the Closing Date or (Y) the latest maturity date of any outstanding Incremental Term Loans, (ii) the weighted average life to maturity of any Other Term Loans shall be no shorter than the weighted average life to maturity of the Term Loans made on the Closing Date and any outstanding Incremental Term Loans and (iii) if the Initial Yield on such Other Term Loans exceeds by more than 50 basis points the sum of (A) the margin then in effect for Term Loans that are Eurodollar Loans plus (B) one-quarter of the amount of such upfront fee initially paid in respect of the Term Loans (the amount of such excess above 50 basis points being referred to herein as the Yield Differential), then the Applicable Margin then in effect for each such affected Type of Term Loans shall automatically be increased by the Yield Differential, effective upon the making of the Other Term Loans.  As used in the prior sentence, Initial Yield shall, as determined by the Administrative Agent, be equal to the sum of (x) the margin above the Adjusted 
 
74





 
Eurodollar Rate on such Other Term Loans (which shall be increased by the amount any LIBOR floor applicable to such Other Term Loans on the date such Other Term Loans are made exceeds the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate) plus (y) if the Lenders making such Other Term Loans receive any upfront fee or similar fees (including original issue discount where the amount of such discount is equated to interest based on an assumed four year life to maturity or, if the actual maturity date falls earlier than four years, the lesser number of years, but excluding any arrangement, underwriting, structuring or similar fees) directly or indirectly from the Borrower or any Subsidiary, the amount of such upfront fee or similar divided by the lesser of (A) the average life to maturity of such Other Term Loans and (B) four.  The other terms of the Incremental Term Loans and the Incremental Term Loan Assumption Agreement to the extent not inconsistent with the terms specified in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above shall otherwise be as agreed among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Incremental Term Lenders and reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender as to the effectiveness of each Incremental Term Loan Assumption Agreement and Incremental Revolving Credit Assumption Agreement.  Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that, upon the effectiveness of any Incremental Term Loan Assumption Agreement or Incremental Revolving Credit Assumption Agreement, this Agreement shall be amended to the extent necessary and appropriate to reflect the existence and terms of the Incremental Term Loan Commitment or Incremental Revolving Credit Commitment, as applicable, evidenced thereby.  Any such deemed amendment may be memorialized in writing by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower (any such amendment, an Incremental Amendment) and furnished to the other parties hereto, without requiring the consent of any other Lender, other than the Lenders providing such Incremental Term Loan Commitments or Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments.
 
(c)           All Incremental Term Loans shall rank pari passu in right of payment and security with the initial Term Loans and shall be guaranteed by the Subsidiary Guarantors.
 
(d)           No Incremental Term Loan Commitment or Incremental Revolving Credit Commitment shall become effective under this Section 2.17 unless (i) on the date of such effectiveness, the Administrative Agent shall have received a certificate certifying that the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 shall be satisfied immediately after giving effect to such Incremental Term Loan Commitment or Incremental Revolving Credit Commitment (but such certification shall not be required to the extent such Incremental Term Loan Commitment or Incremental Revolving Credit Commitment is being used to consummate a Limited Condition Acquisition) and that, if utilizing the amounts provided for in clause (B) of the definition of Incremental Facility Maximum Amount, the Borrower is in compliance on a Pro Forma Basis (including with respect to any Permitted Acquisition or permitted Investment to be made in whole or in part, with the proceeds of the relevant Incremental Term Loan (including any Incremental Term Loan Commitment becoming effective contemporaneously with any Incremental Revolving Credit Commitment)) with the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio required therein and (ii) the Administrative Agent shall have received legal opinions, board resolutions and other closing certificates and documentation consistent with those delivered on the Closing Date.  Any additional conditions to the entry into or the making of any Loans pursuant to any Incremental Term Loan Commitment and/or Incremental Revolving Credit Commitment shall be as agreed to between the Borrower and the Lenders providing such Incremental Term Loans and/or Incremental Revolving Credit Loans (including the scope of any representations and warranties to be made at the time the transaction is consummated).
 
(e)           Immediately after giving effect to any Incremental Term Loan Commitment and/or Incremental Revolving Credit Commitment, the borrowings thereunder and the application of proceeds therefrom, (A) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, provided, that to the extent any Incremental Term Loans shall be applied to consummate a Limited Condition Acquisition, then no Specified Event of Default shall exist and be continuing (1) at the time the definitive agreement in respect of such Limited Condition Acquisition is entered into and (2) at the time such Limited Condition
 
75





 
Acquisition is consummated and (B) the representations and warranties contained herein and in the other Loan Documents shall be true and correct in all material respects (exc

s of that date, except to the extent such representations and warranties specifically relate to an earlier date, in which case such representations and warranties shall have been true and correct in all material respects (except for those representations and warranties that are conditioned by materiality or material adverse effect, which shall have been true and correct in all respects) on and as of such earlier date, provided, that to the extent that the proceeds of Loans under any Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments and/or Incremental Term Loan Commitments are to be used to finance a Limited Condition Acquisition, then (1) accuracy of representations and warranties as described in clause (B) hereof shall be required as of the time the definitive agreement in respect of Limited Condition Acquisition is entered into and (2) the availability thereof shall be subject to customary SunGard limitations to the extent agreed by the Lenders providing such Loans.  If applicable, the Administrative Agent shall have received a Notice of Borrowing in respect of any Incremental Term Loans or Incremental Revolving Loans by the date and time required hereunder with respect to the applicable Type of Loan.
 
(f)            Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that the Administrative Agent may take any and all action as may be reasonably necessary to ensure that all Incremental Term Loans (other than Other Term Loans), when originally made, are included in each Borrowing of outstanding Term Loans on a pro rata basis, and the Borrower agrees that Section 3.02 shall apply to any conversion of Eurodollar Loans which are Term Loans to Base Rate Loans reasonably required by the Administrative Agent to effect the foregoing.  In addition, to the extent any Incremental Term Loans are not Other Term Loans, the scheduled amortization payments set forth in Section 2.13(b) required to be made after the making of such Incremental Term Loans shall be ratably increased by the aggregate principal amount of such Incremental Term Loans.
 
Section 2.18                  Revolving Loan Maturity Extension.
 
(a)           At least 30 days prior to, but not more than 90 days prior to, any anniversary of the Closing Date (or such later date as may be agreed to by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion), the Borrower, by written notice to the Administrative Agent, may request an extension of the Revolving Facility Termination Date to the date that is one year after the then existing Revolving Facility Termination Date (such existing Revolving Facility Termination Date, the Existing Revolving Facility Termination Date).  The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of such request, and each Lender shall, in turn, in its sole discretion, not later than 10 days after delivery of such notice by the Administrative Agent to the Lenders, notify the Administrative Agent in writing as to whether such Lender consents to such extension.  If any Lender shall fail to notify the Administrative Agent in writing of its consent to any such request for extension of the Revolving Facility Termination Date not later than 10 days after the delivery of such notice by the Administrative Agent to the Lenders, such Lender shall be deemed to have not consented to such extension.  The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower of the consents received with respect to the Borrowers request for an extension of the Revolving Facility Termination Date.  The Revolving Facility Termination Date may be extended pursuant to this Section 2.18 on not more than one occasion during the term of this Agreement.
 
(b)           If Lenders constituting the Required Revolving Lenders consent in writing to any such request in accordance with Section 2.18(a), the Revolving Facility Termination Date shall be extended to the date which is one year after the Existing Revolving Facility Termination Date as to those Lenders that so consented (each, an Extending Lender) but shall not be extended as to any Non-Extending Lender; provided that no extension of the Revolving Facility Termination Date pursuant to this Section shall become effective unless the Administrative Agent shall have received a certificate signed by the chief

financial officer of the Borrower, dated as of the effective date of such extension, certifying that (i) as of and on such date, no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and (ii) the representations and warranties of each Credit Party set forth in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents are true and correct in all material respects (or in the case of any representation and warranty that is already subject to a materiality qualifier, true and correct) on and as of such date, except to the extent any such representations and warranties are expressly limited to an earlier date, in which case such representations and warranties continue to be true and correct in all material respects (or in the case of any representation and warranty that is already subject to a materiality qualifier, true and correct) as of such specified earlier date.  To the extent that the Revolving Facility Termination Date is not extended as to any Non-Extending Lender pursuant to this Section 2.18 and the Commitment of such Non-Extending Lender is not assigned in accordance with Section 2.18(c) on or prior to the applicable Existing Revolving Facility Termination Date, (A) the Commitment of such Non-Extending Lender shall automatically terminate in whole on such Existing Revolving Facility Termination Date without any further notice or other action by the Borrower, such Lender or any other Person and (B) the principal amount of any outstanding Loans made by Non-Extending Lenders, together with any accrued interest thereon and any accrued fees and other amounts payable to or for the account of such Non-Extending Lenders hereunder, shall be due and payable on such Existing Revolving Facility Termination Date, and on such Existing Revolving Facility Termination Date the Borrower shall also make such other prepayments of the Loans pursuant to Section 2.12 as shall be required in order that, after giving effect to the termination of the Commitments of, and all payments to, Non-Extending Lenders pursuant to this sentence, the Aggregate Credit Facility Exposure would not exceed the Total Revolving Commitment; provided that such Non-Extending Lenders rights under Sections 3.01, 3.02, 3.03, 11.01 and 11.02, shall survive such Existing Revolving Facility Termination Date for such Lender as to matters occurring prior to such date.  It is understood and agreed that no Lender shall have any obligation whatsoever to agree to any request made by the Borrower for any requested extension of the Revolving Facility Termination Date.
 
(c)           If, pursuant to Section 2.18(a), the Borrower requests an extension of the Revolving Facility Termination Date and Lenders constituting the Required Revolving Lenders consent to such request, then the Borrower may, at any time after the day that is 27 months prior to the Revolving Facility Termination Date in effect at such time, at its sole expense and effort (including payment of any applicable processing and recordation fees), require any Non-Extending Lender, promptly following notice to such Non-Extending Lender and the Administrative Agent, to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 11.06), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to a willing assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee must be an Eligible Assignee and may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment) and will agree to the applicable request for extension; provided that (i) unless the assignee is already a Lender, the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and the LC Issuers and, so long as no Specified Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, shall have provided its consent to such assignment, in each case, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, conditioned or delayed, (ii) such Non-Extending Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in LC Outstandings, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) such assignment does not conflict with applicable law.
 
(d)           If Lenders constituting the Required Revolving Lenders consent in writing to a requested extension of the Revolving Facility Termination Date, not later than 15 days following the Borrowers delivery of written notice pursuant to Section 2.18(a), the Administrative Agent shall so notify the Borrower, and the Existing Revolving Facility Termination Date then in effect shall, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the proviso in the first sentence of Section 2.18(b), be extended for the additional one-year period as described in Section 2.18(b), and all references in the Loan

Documents to the Revolving Facility Termination Date shall, solely with respect to the Commitments and Credit Facility Exposure of each Extending Lender and each assignee pursuant to Section 2.18(c) for such extension, refer to the Revolving Facility Termination Date as so extended.  Promptly following the applicable Existing Revolving Facility Termination Date, the Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders (including each assignee pursuant to Section 2.18(c)) of such extension of the applicable Existing Revolving Facility Termination Date and shall thereupon record in the Register the relevant information with respect to each such Extending Lender and each such assignee.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Revolving Facility Availability Period and the Revolving Facility Termination Date (without taking into consideration any extension pursuant to this Section), as such terms are used in reference to any LC Issuer or any Letters of Credit issued by such LC Issuers, may not be extended without the prior written consent of such LC Issuer (it being understood and agreed that, in the event any LC Issuer shall not have consented to any such extension, (i) such LC Issuer shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an LC Issuer hereunder through the applicable Existing Revolving Facility Termination Date (or the Revolving Facility Availability Period determined on the basis thereof, as applicable), and thereafter shall have no obligation to issue, amend, extend or renew any Letter of Credit (but shall, in each case, continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections Section 2.03, Section 3.01,  Section 11.01 and Section 11.02, as applicable, as to Letters of Credit issued or made prior to such time, as applicable), and (ii) the Borrower shall cause the LC Outstandings attributable to Letters of Credit issued by such LC Issuer to be zero (or, in the case of LC Outstandings, Cash Collateralized or subject to a back-to-back letter of credit in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the applicable LC Issuer) no later than the day on which such LC Outstandings would have been required to have been reduced to zero in accordance with the terms hereof without giving effect to any effectiveness of the extension of the applicable Existing Revolving Facility Termination Date pursuant to this Section (and, in any event, no later than the applicable Existing Revolving Facility Termination Date)).
 
Section 2.19                  Term Loan Amend and Extend Transactions.
 
(a)           At any time after the Closing Date, Borrower and any Term Lender (any such Term Lender that agrees to participate in such Extension, an Extending Lender) may agree, by notice to the Administrative Agent for further distribution to the Term Lenders (each such notice, an Extension Notice), to extend (an Extension) the maturity date of such Lenders Term Loans (which term, for purposes of this provision, shall also include any Term Loans outstanding hereunder pursuant to a previous amend and extend transaction pursuant to the terms of this Section 2.19 or any Incremental Term Loans) (the Existing Term Loans) to the extended maturity date specified in such Extension Notice and Extension Amendment (each tranche of Term Loans so extended, in each case as well as the original Term Loans not so extended, being deemed a separate class; any Extended Term Loans shall constitute a separate class of Term Loans from the Term Loans from which they were converted; any class of Term Loans the maturity of which shall have been extended pursuant to this Section 2.19, Extended Term Loans); provided, that (i) Borrower shall have offered to all Term Lenders under the applicable Term Loan facility that is the subject of the proposed Extension the opportunity to participate in such Extension on a pro rata basis and on the same terms and conditions to each such Term Lender (each such offer, an Extension Offer), provided, that each Term Lender shall be entitled to agree or decline to participate in any such Extension in its sole discretion and if any such Term Lender does not respond to such Extension Offer within five (5) Business Days, such Term Lender shall be deemed to have declined to participate therein), (ii) subject to clauses (iv) and (v), the Extended Term Loans shall have the same terms as the class of Term Loans that was the subject of the Extension Notice; provided that the Extension Offer and/or Extension Amendment may provide for other covenants and terms that apply to any period after the Term Loan Maturity Date then in effect, (iii) any Extended Term Loans may participate on a pro rata basis or on a less than pro rata basis (but not on a greater than pro rata basis) in any mandatory prepayments or commitment reductions hereunder, as specified in the applicable Extension Offer, (iv) the
 
78





 
interest rates, rate floors, fees, original issue discounts, premiums, final maturity date, and scheduled amortization (subject to the limitations set forth in clause (v) of this Section 2.19(a)) applicable to any Extended Term Loans shall be determined by Borrower and the Extending Lenders, (v) before the Term Loan Maturity Date then in effect, the amortization of any Extended Term Loans shall not exceed equal quarterly installments in an aggregate annual amount equal to 1% of the original principal amount of the Extended Term Loans and (vi)  all documentation in respect of such Extension Offer (including any Extension Notice and any amendment to this Agreement implementing the terms of such Extension Offer (each such amendment, an Extension Amendment)) shall be consistent with the foregoing.  In connection with any such Extension, Borrower and the Administrative Agent, with the approval of the Extending Lenders of the applicable Extension Series, may effect such amendments (including any Extension Amendment) to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent and Borrower, to implement the terms of any such Extension Offer, including any amendments necessary to establish new classes, tranches or sub-tranches in respect of the Extended Term Loans and such technical amendments as may be necessary or appropriate in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent and Borrower in connection with the establishment of such new tranches or sub-tranches (including to preserve the pro rata treatment of the extended and non-extended tranches), in each case on terms not inconsistent with this Section 2.19.
 
(b)           Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, on any date on which any Existing Term Loan is converted to extend the related scheduled maturity date(s) in accordance with Section 2.19(a) (an Extension Date), the aggregate principal amount of the existing Term Loans shall be deemed reduced by an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of Extended Term Loans so converted by such Lender on such date, and the Extended Term Loans shall be established as a separate class of Term Loans (together with any other Extended Term Loans so established on such date).  If the aggregate principal amount of Term Loans (calculated on the face amount thereof) in respect of which Extending Lenders shall have accepted the relevant Extension Offer shall exceed the maximum aggregate principal amount of Term Loans offered to be extended by Borrower pursuant to such Extension Offer, then the Term Loans of such Extending Lenders shall be extended ratably up to such maximum amount based on the respective principal amounts (but not to exceed actual holdings of record) with respect to which such Extending Lenders have accepted such Extension Offer.
 
(c)           With respect to all Extensions consummated by Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.19, (i) such Extensions shall not constitute voluntary or mandatory payments or prepayments for purposes of Section 2.13 and (ii) any Extension Offer is required to be in a minimum amount of $30,000,000. Borrower may at its election specify as a condition to consummating any such Extension that a minimum amount (to be determined and specified in the relevant Extension Offer in Borrowers sole discretion and may be waived by Borrower) of Term Loans of any or all applicable tranches accept the applicable Extension Offer.
 
(d)           In connection with any Extension, Borrower shall provide the Administrative Agent at least ten (10) Business Days (or such shorter period as may be agreed by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion) prior written notice thereof, and shall agree to such procedures, if any, as may be established by, or acceptable to, the Administrative Agent, in each case acting reasonably, to accomplish the purposes of this Section 2.19.
 
(e)           In connection with any Extension Amendment, Borrower shall deliver (i) an opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent as to the enforceability of such Extension Amendment and the Loan Documents as amended thereby, that such Extension Amendment, including the Extended Term Loans provided for therein, does not breach or cause a Default or Event of Default under the terms and provisions of Section 11.12 of this Agreement and such other opinions reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent, (ii) customary reaffirmations and/or such amendments to the
 
79





 
Collateral Documents as may be reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent in order to ensure that such Extended Term Loans are provided with the benefit of the applicable Loan Documents and (iii) board resolutions and other closing certificates and documentation to the extent reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent.
 
(f)            In the event that the Administrative Agent determines in its sole discretion that the allocation of Extended Term Loans of a given Extension Series to a given Lender was incorrectly determined as a result of manifest administrative error, then the Administrative Agent, Borrower and such affected Lender may (and hereby are authorized to), in their sole discretion and without the consent of any other Lender, enter into an amendment to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (each, a Corrective Extension Amendment) within 15 days following the effective date of the applicable Extension Amendment, as the case may be, which Corrective Extension Amendment shall (i) provide for the conversion and extension of Term Loans under the Existing Term Loan Class in such amount as is required to cause such Lender to hold Extended Term Loans of the applicable Extension Series into which such other Term Loans were initially converted in the amount such Lender would have held had such administrative error not occurred and had such Lender received the minimum allocation of the applicable Extended Term Loans to which it was entitled under the terms of such Extension Amendment, in the absence of such error, (ii) be subject to the satisfaction of such conditions as the Administrative Agent, Borrower and such Lender may agree (including conditions of the type required to be satisfied for the effectiveness of an Extension Amendment described in Section 2.19(a)), and (iii) effect such other amendments of the type (with appropriate reference and nomenclature changes) described in the penultimate sentence of Section 2.19(a).
 
(g)           This Section 2.19 shall supersede any provisions in Section 11.12  to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, any of the provisions of this Section 2.19 may be amended with the consent of the Required Lenders; provided that no such amendment shall require any Lender to provide any Extended Term Loans without such Lenders consent.
 
ARTICLE III.
 
INCREASED COSTS, ILLEGALITY AND TAXES
 
Section 3.01                  Increased Costs, Illegality, etc.
 
(a)           In the event that (y) in the case of clause (i) below, the Administrative Agent or (z) in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) below, any Lender or other Recipient, shall have determined on a reasonable basis (which determination shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto):
 
(i)            on any date for determining the interest rate applicable to any Eurodollar Loan for any Interest Period that, by reason of any changes arising after the Closing Date, adequate and fair means do not exist for ascertaining the applicable interest rate on the basis provided for in this Agreement for such Eurodollar Loan; or
 
(ii)           at any time, that such Lender or other Recipient shall incur increased costs or reductions in the amounts received or receivable by it hereunder in an amount that such Lender or other Recipient deems material with respect to any Eurodollar Loans (other than any increased cost or reduction in the amount received or receivable resulting from the imposition of or a change in the rate of any (A) Indemni

ny compulsory loan requirement, insurance charge or other assessment) against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender or other Recipient, but, in all events, excluding reserves already includable in the interest rate applicable to such Eurodollar Loan pursuant to this Agreement) or (y) other circumstances adversely affecting the London interbank market or the position of such Lender or other Recipient in any such market; or
 
(iii)          at any time, that the making or continuance of any Eurodollar Loan has become unlawful by compliance by such Lender in good faith with any Change in Law since the Closing Date, or would conflict with any thereof not having the force of law but with which such Lender customarily complies, or has become impracticable as a result of a contingency occurring after the Closing Date that materially adversely affects the London interbank market;
 
then, and in each such event, such Lender or other Recipient (or the Administrative Agent in the case of clause (i) above) shall (1) on or promptly following such date or time and (2) within 10 Business Days of the date on which such event no longer exists give notice (by telephone confirmed in writing) to the Borrower and to the Administrative Agent of such determination (which notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to each of the other Lenders or other Recipients).  Thereafter (x) in the case of clause (i) above, the affected Type of Eurodollar Loans shall no longer be available until such time as the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders or other Recipients that the circumstances giving rise to such notice by the Administrative Agent no longer exist, and any Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Continuation or Conversion given by the Borrower with respect to such Type of Eurodollar Loans that have not yet been incurred, Converted or Continued shall be deemed rescinded by the Borrower or, in the case of a Notice of Borrowing, shall, at the option of the Borrower, be deemed converted into a Notice of Borrowing for Base Rate Loans to be made on the date of Borrowing contained in such Notice of Borrowing, (y) in the case of clause (ii) above, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender or other Recipient, upon written demand therefor, such additional amounts (in the form of an increased rate of, or a different method of calculating, interest or otherwise as such Lender or other Recipient shall determine) as shall be required to compensate such Lender or other Recipient for such increased costs or reductions in amounts receivable hereunder (a written notice as to the additional amounts owed to such Lender or other Recipient, showing the basis for the calculation thereof, which basis must be reasonable, submitted to the Borrower by such Lender or other Recipient shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto) and (z) in the case of clause (iii) above, the Borrower shall take one of the actions specified in Section 3.01(b) as promptly as possible and, in any event, within the time period required by law.
 
(b)           At any time that any Eurodollar Loan is affected by the circumstances described in Section 3.01(a)(ii) or iii, the Borrower may (and in the case of a Eurodollar Loan affected pursuant to Section 3.01(a)(iii) the Borrower shall) either (i) if the affected Eurodollar Loan is then being made pursuant to a Borrowing, by giving the Administrative Agent telephonic notice (confirmed promptly in writing) thereof on the same date that the Borrower was notified by a Lender or other Recipient pursuant to Section 3.01(a)(ii) or iii, cancel said Borrowing, or, in the case of any Borrowing, convert the related Notice of Borrowing into one requesting a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans or require the affected Lender or other Recipient to make its requested Loan as a Base Rate Loan, or (ii) if the affected Eurodollar Loan is then outstanding, upon at least one Business Days notice to the Administrative Agent, require the affected Lender or other Recipient to Convert each such Eurodollar Loan into a Base Rate Loan; provided, however, that if more than one Lender or other Recipient is affected at any time, then all affected Lenders or other Recipients must be treated the same pursuant to this Section 3.01(b).
 
(c)           If any Lender shall have determined that after the Closing Date, any Change in Law regarding capital adequacy or liquidity by any Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable 
 
81





 
agency charged by law with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by such Lender or its parent corporation with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy or liquidity (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank, or comparable agency, in each case made subsequent to the Closing Date, has or would have the effect of reducing by an amount reasonably deemed by such Lender to be material to the rate of return on such Lenders or its parent corporations capital or assets as a consequence of such Lenders commitments or obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Lender or its parent corporation would have achieved but for such adoption, effectiveness, change or compliance (taking into consideration such Lenders or its parent corporations policies with respect to capital adequacy and liquidity), then from time to time, within 15 days after demand by such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or its parent corporation for such reduction.  Each Lender, upon determining in good faith that any additional amounts will be payable pursuant to this Section 3.01(c), will give prompt written notice thereof to the Borrower, which notice shall set forth, in reasonable detail, the basis of the calculation of such additional amounts, which basis must be reasonable, although the failure to give any such notice shall not release or diminish any of the Borrowers obligations to pay additional amounts pursuant to this Section 3.01(c) upon the subsequent receipt of such notice.
 
(d)           Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) no Lender shall be entitled to compensation or payment or reimbursement of other amounts under Section 3.01 or Section 3.04 for any amounts incurred or accruing more than 180 days prior to the giving of notice to the Borrower of additional costs or other amounts of the nature described in such Sections (provided that if such additional costs or other amounts arose as a result of a Change in Law that was retroactive, then such 180 day period shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof), and (ii) no Lender shall demand compensation for any reduction referred to in Section 3.01(c) or payment or reimbursement of other amounts under Section 3.04 if it shall not at the time be the general policy or practice of such Lender to demand such compensation, payment or reimbursement in similar circumstances under comparable provisions of other credit agreements.
 
Section 3.02                  Breakage Compensation.  The Borrower shall compensate each Lender, upon its written request (which request shall set forth the detailed basis for requesting and the method of calculating such compensation), for all reasonable losses, costs, expenses and liabilities (including, without limitation, any loss, cost, expense or liability incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds required by such Lender to fund its Eurodollar Loans) which such Lender may sustain in connection with any of the following: (i) if for any reason (other than a default by such Lender or the Administrative Agent) a Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans does not occur on a date specified therefor in a Notice of Borrowing or a Notice of Continuation or Conversion (other than a Notice of Borrowing deemed withdrawn pursuant to Section 3.01(a)); (ii) if any repayment, prepayment, Conversion or Continuation of any Eurodollar Loan occurs on a date that is not the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto; (iii) if any prepayment of any of its Eurodollar Loans is not made on any date specified in a notice of prepayment given by the Borrower; (iv) as a result of an assignment by a Lender of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto pursuant to a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 3.05(b); or (v) as a consequence of (y) any other default by the Borrower to repay or prepay any Eurodollar Loans when required by the terms of this Agreement or (z) an election made pursuant to Section 3.05(b).  The written request of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such request within 10 days after receipt thereof.

Section 3.03                  Net Payments.
 
(a)           Defined Terms.  For purposes of this Section 3.03, the term Lender includes any LC Issuer and the term applicable law includes FATCA.
 
(b)           Payments Free of Taxes.  Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Credit Party under any Loan Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable law.  If any applicable law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable Withholding Agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a Withholding Agent, then the applicable Withholding Agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the applicable Credit Party shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made.
 
(c)           Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower.  The Credit Parties shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes.
 
(d)           Indemnification by the Credit Parties.  The Credit Parties shall jointly and severally indemnify each Recipient, within 10 days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
 
(e)           Indemnification by the Lenders.  Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Credit Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Credit Parties to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lenders failure to comply with the provisions of Section 11.06(b) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this paragraph (e).
 
(f)            Evidence of Payments.  As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by any Credit Party to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section 3.03, such Credit Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
 
83





 
(g)           Status of Lenders.  (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent and at the time or times prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent or prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding.  In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 3.03(g)(ii)(A),  (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lenders reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.
 
(ii)           Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that the Borrower is a U.S. Borrower,
 
(A)          any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding Tax;
 
(B)          any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:
 
(1)           in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the interest article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the business profits or other income article of such tax treaty;
 
(2)           executed originals of IRS Form W-8ECI;
 
(3)           in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit J-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a bank within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a 10 percent shareholder of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a controlled foreign corporation described in
 
84





 
Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate) and (y) executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN-E; or
 
(4)           to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed originals of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8 BEN-E, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit J-2 or Exhibit J-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit J-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner;

h indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (h), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph (h) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid.  This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.

(c)           Nothing in this Section 3.05 shall affect or postpone any of the obligations of the Borrower or the right of any Lender provided in Sections 3.01, 3.03 or 3.04.

Section 9.01                                                     Appointment.
 
(a)                                 Each Lender hereby irrevocably designates and appoints the Administrative Agent to act as specified herein and in the other Loan Documents, and each such Lender hereby irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent for such Lender, to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.  The Administrative Agent agrees to act as such upon the express conditions contained in this Article.  Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein or in the other Loan Documents, nor any fiduciary relationship with any Lender or LC Issuer, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or otherwise exist against the 
 
130





 
Administrative Agent. The provisions of this Article IX are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and no Credit Party shall have any rights as a third-party beneficiary of any of the provisions hereof.  In performing its functions and duties under this Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall act solely as agent of the Lenders and does not assume and shall not be deemed to have assumed any obligation or relationship of agency or trust with or for the Credit Parties or any of their respective Subsidiaries.
 
(b)                                 Each Lender hereby further irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent on behalf of and for the benefit of the Lenders, to be the agent for and representative of the Lenders with respect to the Guaranty Agreements, the Security Documents, the Collateral and any other Loan Document.  Each Lender irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent to accept, for and on behalf of the Lender, any parallel debt obligations with the Credit Parties pursuant to which the Administrative Agent shall have its own, independent right to demand payment of the amounts payable by each Credit Party in connection with the Obligations.  Subject to Section 11.12, without further written consent or authorization from Lenders, the Administrative Agent may execute any documents or instruments necessary to (i) release any Lien (x) encumbering any item of Collateral that is the subject of a sale or other disposition of assets permitted hereby or to which the Required Lenders (or such other Lenders as may be required to give such consent under Section 11.12) have otherwise consented or (y) upon the termination of the Commitments and the payment in full (other than contingent indemnification obligations and unasserted expense reimbursement obligations) of all Obligations and the expiration or termination of all Letters of Credit (other than those that have been Cash Collateralized or backstopped), (ii) subordinate any Lien (x) to the extent such subordination is expressly permitted under this Agreement or (y) to which the Required Lenders (or such other Lenders as may be required to give such consent under Section 11.12) have otherwise consented, or (iii) release any Subsidiary Guarantor from a Guaranty Agreement (w) if all of the Equity Interests of such Subsidiary Guarantor owned by any Credit Party are sold in a sale permitted under the Loan Documents (including pursuant to a waiver or consent), (x) if such Subsidiary Guarantor becomes an Excluded Subsidiary in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, (y) upon the termination of the Commitments and the payment in full (other than contingent indemnification obligations and unasserted expense reimbursement obligations) of all Obligations and the expiration or termination of all Letters of Credit (other than those that have been Cash Collateralized or backstopped) or (z) with respect to which the Required Lenders (or such other Lenders as may be required to give such consent under Section 11.12) have otherwise consented.
 
(c)                                  Solely for the purposes of English law, the Administrative Agent declares that pursuant to the terms of the UK Security Documents it shall hold the UK Security Property as security trustee for the UK Secured Parties on the terms contained in this Agreement and the UK Security Documents.  Each of the parties to this Agreement acknowledges and agrees to such appointment of the Administrative Agent as security trustee and agrees that the Administrative Agent shall have only those duties, obligations and responsibilities expressly specified in this Agreement or in the UK Security Documents (and no others shall be implied).
 
(d)                                 Solely for the purposes of Irish law, the Administrative Agent declares that pursuant to the terms of the Irish Security Documents it shall hold the Irish Security Property as security trustee for the Irish Secured Parties on the terms contained in this Agreement and the Irish Security Documents.  Each of the parties to this Agreement acknowledges and agrees to such appointment of the Administrative Agent as security trustee and agrees that the Administrative Agent shall have only those duties, obligations and responsibilities expressly specified in this Agreement or in the Irish Security Documents (and no others shall be implied).
 
(e)                                  Anything contained in any of the Loan Documents to the contrary notwithstanding, the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and each Lender hereby agree that (i) no Lender shall have any right 
 
131





 
individually to realize upon any of the Collateral or to enforce any Guaranty Agreement, it being understood and agreed that all powers, rights and remedies hereunder may be exercised solely by the Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Lenders in accordance with the terms hereof and all powers, rights and remedies under the Loan Documents may be exercised solely by the Administrative Agent, and (ii) in the event of a foreclosure by the Administrative Agent on any of the Collateral pursuant to a public or private sale, the Administrative Agent or any Lender may be the purchaser of any or all of such Collateral at any such sale and the Administrative Agent, as agent for and representative of the Secured Creditors (but not any Lender or Lenders in its or their respective individual capacities unless the Required Lenders shall otherwise agree in writing) shall be entitled, for the purpose of bidding and making settlement or payment of the purchase price for all or any portion of the Collateral sold at any such public sale, to use and apply any of the Obligations as a credit on account of the purchase price for any collateral payable by the Administrative Agent at such sale.
 
(f)                                   For greater certainty, and without limiting the powers of the Administrative Agent, each Lender, on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates, hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent to act as the hypothecary representative of the Secured Creditors (as contemplated in Article 2692 of the Civil Code of Québec) in order to enter into, to take and to hold, on their behalf and for their benefit, hypothecs granted by any Credit Party on property pursuant to the laws of the Province of Québec in order to secure obligations of any Credit Party hereunder or under any other Loan Document or Designated Hedge Agreement and to exercise such powers and duties that are conferred upon the Administrative Agent thereunder.  The execution by the Administrative Agent, acting as such hypothecary representative, prior to this Agreement of any deeds of hypothec is hereby ratified and confirmed.  The constitution of the Administrative Agent as hypothecary representative shall be deemed to have been ratified and confirmed by (on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates) each Person accepting an assignment of, a participation in or an arrangement in respect of, all or any portion of any Secured Creditors rights and obligations under this Agreement, the other Loan Documents or a Designated Hedge Agreement by the execution of an assignment, including an Assignment Agreement, or other agreement pursuant to which it becomes such assignee or participant.  The Administrative Agent, acting as hypothecary representative shall have the same rights, powers, immunities, indemnities and exclusions from liability as are prescribed in favor of the Administrative Agent in this Agreement, which shall apply mutatis mutandis to the Administrative Agent acting as hypothecary representative.
 
Section 9.02                                                     Delegation of Duties.  The Administrative Agent may execute any of its duties under this Agreement or any other Loan Document by or through agents, sub-agents, delegates, co-security trustees (in the case of the UK Security Documents, the Irish Security Documents or the Northern Irish Security Documents) or attorneys-in-fact, and shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agents, sub-agents, delegates, co-security trustees (in the case of the UK Security Documents, the Irish Security Documents or the Northern Irish Security Documents) or attorneys-in-fact selected by it with reasonable care except to the extent otherwise required by Section 9.03.  All of the rights, benefits and privileges (including the exculpatory and indemnification provisions) of Section 9.03 shall apply to any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities as sub-agent as if such sub-agent and Affiliates were named herein.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, with respect to each sub-agent appointed by the Administrative Agent, (i) such sub-agent shall be a third party beneficiary under this Agreement with respect to all such rights, benefits and privileges (including exculpatory and rights to indemnification) and shall have all of the rights, benefits and privileges of a third party beneficiary, including an independent right of action to enforce such rights, benefits and privileges (including exculpatory rights and rights to indemnification) directly, without the consent or joinder of any other Person, against any or all of the Credit Parties and the Lenders, (ii) such rights, benefits and privileges (including exculpatory rights and rights to indemnification) shall not be modified or amended without the consent of such sub-agent, and (iii) such sub-agent shall only have obligations to
 
132





 
the Administrative Agent and not to any Credit Party, any Lender or any other Person and no Credit Party, Lender or any other Person shall have the rights, directly or indirectly, as a third party beneficiary or otherwise, against such sub-agent.
 
Section 9.03                                                     Exculpatory Provisions.  Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its Related Parties nor any Receiver shall be (a) liable for any action lawfully taken or omitted to be taken by it or such Person under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document (except for its or such Related Parties own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a final non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction) or (b) responsible in any manner to any of the Lenders for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by the Credit Parties or any of their respective Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers contained in this Agreement, any other Loan Document or in any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by the Administrative Agent under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other Loan Document or for any failure of any Credit Party or any of its officers to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder.  The Administrative Agent shall not be under any obligation to any Lender to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or to inspect the properties, books or records of the Credit Parties or any of their respective Subsidiaries.  The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible to any Lender for the effectiveness, genuineness, validity, enforceability, collectability or sufficiency of this Agreement or any Loan Document or for any representations, warranties, recitals or statements made herein or therein or made in any written or oral statement or in any financial or other statements, instruments, reports, certificates or any other documents in connection herewith or therewith furnished or made by the Administrative Agent to the Lenders or by or on behalf of the Credit Parties or any of their respective Subsidiaries to the Administrative Agent or any Lender or be required to ascertain or inquire as to the performance or observance of any of the terms, conditions, provisions, covenants or agreements contained herein or therein or as to the use of the proceeds of the Loans or of the existence or possible existence of any Default or Event of Default.
 
Section 9.04                                                     Reliance by Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any note, writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, cablegram, telegram, e-mail or other electronic transmission, facsimile transmission, telex or teletype message, statement, order or other document or conversation believed by it, in good faith, to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including, without limitation, counsel to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries), independent accountants and other experts selected by the Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement or any other Loan Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders as it deems appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense that may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action.  The Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents in accordance with a request of the Required Lenders or all of the Lenders, as applicable, as to any matter that, pursuant to Section 11.12, can only be effectuated with the consent of all Required Lenders or all applicable Lenders, as the case may be), and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Lenders.
 
Section 9.05                                                     Notice of Default.  The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default hereunder unless the Administrative Agent has received notice from a Lender or the Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a notice of default.  If the Administrative Agent receives such a notice, the Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to 
 
133





 
the Lenders.  The Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be reasonably directed by the Required Lenders (or the Required Revolving Lenders with respect to any Event of Default under Section 7.07); provided, however, that unless and until the Administrative Agent shall have received such directions, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall reasonably deem advisable in the best interests of the Lenders.
 
Section 9.06                                                     Non-Reliance.  Each Lender expressly acknowledges that neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its Related Parties has made any representations or warranties to it and that no act by the Administrative Agent hereinafter taken, including, without limitation, any review of the affairs of the Credit Parties or their respective Subsidiaries, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by the Administrative Agent to any Lender.  Each Lender represents to the Administrative Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of, and investigation into, the business, assets, operations, property, financial and other conditions, prospects and creditworthiness of the Credit Parties and their Subsidiaries and made its own decision to make its Loans hereunder and enter into this Agreement.  Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement, and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, assets, operations, property, financial and other conditions, prospects and creditworthiness of the Credit Parties and their Subsidiaries.  The Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, operations, assets, property, financial and other conditions, prospects or creditworthiness of the Credit Parties and their Subsidiaries that may come into the possession of the Administrative Agent or any of its Related Parties.
 
Section 9.07                                                     No Reliance on Administrative Agents Customer Identification Program.  Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that neither such Lender, nor any of its Affiliates, participants or assignees, may rely on the Administrative Agent to carry out such Lenders, Affiliates, participants or assignees customer identification program, or other obligations required or imposed under or pursuant to the USA Patriot Act or the regulations thereunder, including the regulations contained in 31 CFR 103.121 (as hereafter amended or replaced, the CIP Regulations), or any other Anti-Terrorism Law, including any programs involving any of the following items relating to or in connection with the Credit Parties or their respective Subsidiaries, any of their respective Affiliates or agents, the Loan Documents or the transactions hereunder:  (a) any identity verification procedures, (b) any record keeping, (c) any comparisons with government lists, (d) any customer notices or (e) any other procedures required under the CIP Regulations or such other laws.
 
Section 9.08                                                     USA Patriot Act.  Each Lender or assignee or participant of a Lender that is not organized under the laws of the United States of America or a state thereof (and is not excepted from the certification requirement contained in Section 313 of the USA Patriot Act and the applicable regulations because it is both (a) an affiliate of a depository institution or foreign bank that maintains a physical presence in the United States or foreign country, and (b) subject to supervision by a banking authority regulating such affiliated depository institution or foreign bank) shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the certification, or, if applicable, recertification, certifying that such Lender is not a shell and certifying to other matters as required by Section 313 of the USA Patriot Act and the applicable regulations:  (i) within 10 days after the Closing Date, and (ii) at such other times as are required under the USA Patriot Act.
 
134





 
Section 9.09                                                     Indemnification.  The Lenders agree to indemnify the Administrative Agent and its Related Parties, ratably according to their pro rata share of the Aggregate Credit Facility Exposure, from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, reasonable expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever that may at any time (including, without limitation, at any time following the payment of the Obligations) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent or such Related Parties in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or the transactions contemplated hereby or any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Administrative Agent or such Related Parties under or in connection with any of the foregoing, but only to the extent that any of the foregoing is not paid by the Borrower, but without limitation of the Borrowers obligation to do so; provided, however, that no Lender shall be liable to the Administrative Agent or any of its Related Parties for the payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements to the extent resulting solely from the Administrative Agents or such Related Parties gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a final non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.  If any indemnity furnished to the Administrative Agent or any such Related Parties for any purpose shall, in the opinion of the Administrative Agent, be insufficient or become impaired, the Administrative Agent may call for additional indemnity and cease, or not commence, to do the acts indemnified against until such additional indemnity is furnished.  The agreements in this Section shall survive the payment of all Obligations.
 
Section 9.10                                                     The Administrative Agent in Individual Capacity.  The Administrative Agent and its Affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from and generally engage in any kind of business with the Credit Parties, their respective Subsidiaries and their Affiliates as though not acting as Administrative Agent hereunder.  With respect to the Loans made by it and all Obligations owing to it, the Administrative Agent shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and the terms Lender and Lenders shall include the Administrative Agent in its individual capacity.
 
Section 9.11                                                     Successor Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent may resign at any time upon not less than 30 days written notice to the Lenders, each LC Issuer and the Borrower.  Such resignation shall take effect upon the earlier of (i) the appointment of a successor Administrative Agent pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the 30th Business Day following receipt by the Borrower, the Lenders and each LC Issuer of the written resignation notice.  Upon receipt of any such written notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, with the consent of the Borrower, to appoint a successor, which consent of the Borrower shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned and which shall not be required during the continuance of a Specified Event of Default.  If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may on behalf of the Lenders and each LC Issuer, with the consent of the Borrower, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned and which shall not be required during the continuance of a Specified Event of Default, appoint a successor Administrative Agent; provided, however, that if the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that no such successor is willing to accept such appointment, then such resignation shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice and the terms hereof.  Upon the effective time of the resignation of the Administrative Agent, (i) the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (except that in the case of any collateral security held by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders or any LC Issuer under any of the Loan Documents, the retiring Administrative Agent shall continue to hold such collateral security until such time as a successor Administrative Agent is appointed) and (ii) all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender and LC Issuer directly, until such time
 
135





 
as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided for above in this paragraph.  Upon the acceptance of a successors appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or retired) Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this paragraph).  The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed in writing between the Borrower and such successor.  After the retiring Administrative Agents resignation hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article and Section 11.02 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring Administrative Agent was acting as Administrative Agent.
 
For purposes of any Security Document expressed to be governed by the laws of the Netherlands, any resignation by the Administrative Agent is not effective with respect to its rights under any parallel debt obligations until all rights and obligations with respect to such parallel debt obligations have been assigned to and assumed by the successor agent. The Administrative Agent will reasonably cooperate in assigning its right under the parallel debt obligations to any such successor agent and will reasonably cooperate in transferring all rights under any Security Document expressed to be governed by the laws of the Netherlands (as the case may be) to such successor agent.
 
Section 9.12                                                     Other Agents.  Any Lender identified herein as a Co-Agent, Syndication Agent, Documentation Agent, Managing Agent, Manager, Lead Arranger, Arranger or any other corresponding title, other than Administrative Agent, shall have no right, power, obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this Agreement or any other Loan Document except those applicable to all Lenders as such.  Each Lender acknowledges that it has not relied, and will not rely, on any Lender so identified in deciding to enter into this Agreement or in taking or not taking any action hereunder.

In the event that any Lender sells participations in a Loan, such Lender shall, acting for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name of all participants in such Loan and the principal amount of (and stated interest on) the portion of such Loan that is the subject of the participation (the Participant Register); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participants interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations.  The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of the participation in question for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.  A Loan (and the registered note, if any, evidencing the same) may be participated in whole or in part only by registration of such participation on the Participant Register (and each registered note shall expressly so provide).  Any participation of a Loan (and the registered note, if any, evidencing the same) may be effected only by the registration of such participation on the Participant Register.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.
 
(c)                                  Assignments by Lenders.
 
(i)                                     Any Lender may assign all, or if less than all, a fixed portion, of its Loans, LC Participations and/or Commitments and its rights and obligations hereunder to one or more Eligible Assignees, each of which shall become a party to this Agreement as a Lender by execution of an Assignment Agreement; provided, however, that
 
(A)                               except in the case of (x) an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lenders Loans and/or Commitments or (y) an assignment to another Lender, an Affiliate of such Lender or an Approved Fund with respect to such Lender, the aggregate amount of the Commitment so assigned (which for this purpose includes the Loans outstanding thereunder) shall not be less than $1,000,000 in the case of any assignment in respect of the Revolving Facility and $1,000,000 in the case of any assignment in respect of the Term Loans;
 
(B)                               in the case of any assignment to an Eligible Assignee at the time of any such assignment the Lender Register shall be deemed modified to reflect the Commitments of such new Lender and of the existing Lenders;
 
(C)                               upon surrender of the old Notes, if any, upon request of the new Lender, new Notes will be issued, at the Borrowers expense, to such new Lender and to the assigning Lender, to the extent needed to reflect the revised Commitments; and
 
(D)                               unless waived by the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent shall receive at the time of each such assignment, from the assigning or assignee Lender, the payment of a non-refundable assignment fee of $3,500.
 
(ii)                                  To the extent of any assignment pursuant to this subpart (c), the assigning Lender shall be relieved of its obligations hereunder with respect to its assigned Commitments provided, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no assignment by a Defaulting Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lenders having been a Defaulting Lender.
 
147





 
(iii)                               At the time of each assignment pursuant to this subpart (c), to a Person that is not already a Lender hereunder, the respective assignee Lender shall provide to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent the applicable Internal Revenue Service Forms and all other documentation described in Section 3.03(g)(i).
 
(iv)                              With respect to any Lender, the transfer of any Commitment of such Lender and the rights to the principal of, and interest on, any Loan made pursuant to such Commitment shall not be effective until such transfer is recorded on the Lender Register maintained by the Administrative Agent (on behalf of and acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower) with respect to ownership of such Commitment and Loans, including the name and address of the Lenders and the principal amount of the Loans (and stated interest thereon).  Prior to such recordation, all amounts owing to the transferor with respect to such Commitment and Loans shall remain owing to the transferor.  The registration of assignment or transfer of all or part of any Commitments and Loans shall be recorded by the Administrative Agent on the Lender Register only upon the acceptance by the Administrative Agent of a properly executed and delivered Assignment Agreement pursuant to this subpart (c).
 
(v)                                 Nothing in this Section shall prevent or prohibit (A) any Lender that is a bank, trust company or other financial institution from pledging its Notes or Loans to a Federal Reserve Bank, central banking authority or to any Person that extends credit to such Lender in support of borrowings made by such Lender from such Federal Reserve Bank, central banking authority or such other Person, or (B) any Lender that is a trust, limited liability company, partnership or other investment company from pledging its Notes or Loans to a trustee or agent for the benefit of holders of certificates or debt securities issued by it.  No such pledge, or any assignment pursuant to or in lieu of an enforcement of such a pledge, shall relieve the transferor Lender from its obligations hereunder.
 
(vi)                              In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments to the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with the consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Loans previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent, each LC Issuer and each other Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon), and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro rata share of all Loans and participations in Letters of Credit in accordance with its Revolving Facility Percentage.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under applicable law without compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs.
 
(d)                                 No SEC Registration or Blue Sky Compliance.  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section, no transfer or assignment of the interests or obligations of any Lender hereunder or any grant of participation therein shall be permitted if such transfer, assignment or grant would require the Borrower to file a registration statement with the SEC or to qualify the Loans under the Blue Sky laws of any State.
 
148





 
(e)                                  Representations of Lenders.  Each Lender initially party to this Agreement hereby represents, and each Person that becomes a Lender pursuant to an assignment permitted by this Section will, upon its becoming party to this Agreement, represents that it is a commercial lender, other financial institution or other accredited investor (as defined in SEC Regulation D) that makes or acquires loans in the ordinary course of its business and that it will make or acquire Loans for its own account in the ordinary course of such business; provided, however, that subject to Section 11.06(b), (c) and (f), the disposition of any promissory notes or other evidences of or interests in Indebtedness held by such Lender shall at all times be within its exclusive control.
 
(f)                                   Special Purpose Funding Vehicles.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender (Granting Lender) may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle (a SPC), identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Lender to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, the option to provide to the Borrower all or any part of any Loan that such Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to make to the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement; provided that (x) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPC to make any Loans and (y) if an SPC elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to provide all or any part of such Loan, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to make such Loan pursuant to the terms hereof.  The making of a Loan by an SPC hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting Lender to the same extent, and as if, such Loan were made by such Granting Lender.  Each party hereto hereby agrees that no SPC shall be liable for any indemnity or similar payment obligation under this Agreement (all liability for which shall remain with the Granting Lender).  In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby agrees (which agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement) that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding commercial paper or other senior indebtedness of any SPC, it will not institute against, or join any other person in instituting against, such SPC any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings under the laws of the United States or any State thereof.  In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this clause, any SPC may (i) with notice to, but without the prior written consent of, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent and without paying any processing fee therefor, assign all or a portion of its interests in any Loans to the Granting Lender or to any financial institutions (consented to by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent) providing liquidity and/or credit support to or for the account of such SPC to support the funding or maintenance of Loans and (ii) disclose on a confidential basis any non-public information relating to its Loans to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety, guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancement to such SPC.  This Section may not be amended without the written consent of the SPC.  The Borrower acknowledges and agrees that, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, each SPC, for purposes of Sections 2.10, 2.14, 3.01, 3.03, 11.01, 11.02 and 11.03, shall be considered a Lender.
 
Section 11.07                                              No Waiver; Remedies Cumulative.  No failure or delay on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any other Loan Document and no course of dealing between the Borrower and the Administrative Agent or any Lender shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any other Loan Document preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder or thereunder.  No notice to or demand on the Borrower in any case shall entitle the Borrower to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances or constitute a waiver of the rights of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders to any other or further action in any circumstances without notice or demand.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or any LC Issuance shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default or Event of Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any LC Issuer may have had notice or knowledge of such Default or Event of Default at the time.  The rights and remedies herein expressly provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies that the Administrative Agent or any Lender would otherwise have.

(C)                               release all or any substantial portion of the Collateral, except in connection with a transaction permitted under this Agreement;
 
(D)                               amend, modify or waive any provision of this Section 11.12, Section 8.03, or any other provision of any of the Loan Documents pursuant to which the consent or approval of all Lenders, or a number or specified percentage or other required grouping of Lenders or Lenders having Commitments, is by the terms of such provision explicitly required;

152





 
(iii)                               any amendment, change, waiver or other modification to the Fee Letter shall, in each case, be effective if in writing and signed by each of the parties thereto.
 
Any waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement given or made in accordance with this Section shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which it was given or made.
 
(b)                                 No provision of Section 2.05 or any other provision in this Agreement specifically relating to Letters of Credit may be amended without the consent of any LC Issuer adversely affected thereby.
 
(c)                                  No provision of Article IX may be amended without the consent of the Administrative Agent.
 
(d)                                 To the extent the Required Lenders (or all of the Lenders, as applicable, as shall be required by this Section) waive the provisions of Section 7.02 with respect to the sale, transfer or other disposition of any Collateral, or any Collateral is sold, transferred or disposed of as permitted by Section 7.02, (i) such Collateral (but not any proceeds thereof) shall be sold, transferred or disposed of free and clear of the Liens created by the respective Security Documents; (ii) if such Collateral includes all of the capital stock of a Subsidiary Guarantor or whose stock is pledged pursuant to any Security Document, such capital stock (but not any proceeds thereof) shall be released from the applicable Security Documents and such Subsidiary shall be released from the applicable Guaranty Agreement; and (iii) the Administrative Agent shall be authorized to take actions deemed appropriate by it in order to effectuate the foregoing.
 
(e)                                  In no event shall the Required Lenders, without the prior written consent of each Lender, direct the Administrative Agent to accelerate and demand payment of the Loans held by one Lender without accelerating and demanding payment of all other Loans or to terminate the Commitments of one or more Lenders without terminating the Commitments of all Lenders.  Each Lender agrees that, except as otherwise provided in any of the Loan Documents and without the prior written consent of the Required Lenders, it will not take any legal action or institute any action or proceeding against any Credit Party with respect to any of the Obligations or Collateral, or accelerate or otherwise enforce its portion of the Obligations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, none of Lenders may exercise any right that it might otherwise have under applicable law to credit bid at foreclosure sales, uniform commercial code sales or other similar sales or dispositions of any of the Collateral except as authorized by the Required Lenders. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 11.12(e) or elsewhere herein, each Lender shall be authorized to take such action to preserve or enforce its rights against any Credit Party where a deadline or limitation period is otherwise applicable and would, absent the taking of specified action, bar the enforcement of Obligations held by such Lender against such Credit Party, including the filing of proofs of claim in any insolvency proceeding.
 
(f)                                   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 11.11, (x) Security Documents (including any Additional Security Documents) and related documents executed by Subsidiaries of the Borrower in connection with this Agreement may be in a form reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent and may be amended, supplemented and waived with the consent of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower without the need to obtain the consent of any other Person if such amendment, supplement or waiver is delivered in order (i) to comply with local law or advice of local counsel, (ii) to cure ambiguities, omissions, mistakes or defects or (iii) to cause such Security Document or other document to be consistent with this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, (y) if following the Closing Date, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall have jointly identified an ambiguity, inconsistency, obvious error or any error or omission of a technical or immaterial nature, in each case, in any provision of the Loan Documents, then the Administrative Agent and the Credit Parties shall be 
 
153





 
permitted to amend such provision and such amendment shall become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to any Loan Documents if the same is not objected to in writing by the Required Lenders within five (5) Business Days following receipt of notice thereof, and (z) the Required Revolving Lenders or the Administrative Agent or by the Administrative Agent acting at the written direction of the Required Revolving Lenders, on the one hand, and the Borrower, on the other hand, may amend, supplement or otherwise modify or waive any of the terms and provisions (and related definitions) of Section 7.07.
 
(g)                                  Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 11.12(a), this Agreement may be amended (or amended and restated) with the written consent of the Required Lenders, the Administrative Agent and the Credit Parties (i) to add one or more additional credit facilities to this Agreement and to permit the extensions of credit from time to time thereunder and the accrued interest and fees in respect thereof to share ratably in the benefits of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents with the Term Loans and the Revolving Loans and the accrued interest and fees in respect thereof, and (ii) to include appropriately the Lenders holding such credit facilities in any determination of the Required Lenders.
 
(h)                                 If, in connection with any proposed amendment, modification, termination, waiver or consent with respect to any provisions hereof as contemplated by this Section 11.11 that requires the consent of a greater percentage of the Lenders than the Required Lenders, the consent of the Required Lenders shall have been obtained but the consent of a Lender whose consent is required shall not have been obtained (each a Non-Consenting Lender), then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with the restrictions contained in Section 11.04(c)), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an Eligible Assignee that shall assume such obligations; provided that (A) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts, including any breakage compensation under Section 3.02 and any amounts accrued and owing to such Lender under Section 3.01(a)(i), Section 3.01(c), Section 3.03 or Section 3.04), and (B) such Eligible Assignee shall consent at the time of such assignment to each matter in respect of which such Non-Consenting Lender did not consent.  Each Lender agrees that, if it becomes a Non-Consenting Lender and is being replaced in accordance with this Section 11.12(f), it shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment Agreement to evidence such assignment and shall deliver to the Administrative Agent any Notes previously delivered to such Non-Consenting Lender.
 
(i)                                     Any Defaulting Lenders right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent hereunder shall be restricted as set forth in the definition of Required Lenders, except that (i) the Commitment of any Defaulting Lender may not be increased or extended without the consent of such Lender and (ii) any waiver, amendment or modification requiring the consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender that (A) by its terms affects any Defaulting Lender more adversely than other affected Lenders, (B) increases or extends the Commitment of any such Defaulting Lender, (C) reduces the principal of or the rate of interest for Loans of such Defaulting Lender, or fees or other amounts payable hereunder or under any other Loan Document to such Defaulting Lender or (D) amends or modifies any provision of this paragraph shall require the consent of such Defaulting Lender.
 
(j)                                    No Lender consent shall be required to effect an Incremental Amendment except as expressly provided in Section 2.17.  In connection therewith, the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders providing the Incremental Term Loan Commitments or Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments, as applicable, may effect such other amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent 
 
154





 
and the Borrower, to effect the provisions of this Section 11.12(j) and this Section 11.12(j) shall supersede any provisions of this Agreement to the contrary.
 
Section 11.13                                              Survival of Indemnities.  All indemnities set forth herein including, without limitation, in Article III, Section 9.09 or Section 11.02 shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the making and repayment of the Obligations.
 
Section 11.14                                              Domicile of Loans.  Each Lender may transfer and carry its Loans at, to or for the account of any branch office, subsidiary or affiliate of such Lender; provided, however, that the Borrower shall not be responsible for costs arising under Section 3.01 resulting from any such transfer (other than a transfer pursuant to Section 3.05) to the extent not otherwise applicable to such Lender prior to such transfer.
 
Section 11.15                                              Confidentiality.
 
(a)                                 Each of the Administrative Agent, each LC Issuer and the Lenders agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information, except that Confidential Information may be disclosed (1) to its and its Affiliates directors, officers, employees and agents, including accountants, legal counsel and other advisors (it being understood that the persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Confidential Information and instructed to keep such Confidential Information confidential), (2) to any direct or indirect contractual counterparty in any Hedge Agreement (or to any such contractual counterpartys professional advisor), so long as such contractual counterparty (or such professional advisor) agrees to be bound by the provisions of this Section, (3) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority, (4) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process (provided that the Administrative Agent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to notify the Borrower prior to such disclosure, to the extent legally permitted to do so), (5) to any other party to this Agreement, (6) to any other creditor of any Credit Party that is a direct or intended beneficiary of any of the Loan Documents, (7) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents, or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, (8) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section, to any assignee of or participant in any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement, or in connection with transactions permitted pursuant to Section 11.06(c)(v) or Section 11.06(f), (9) with the consent of the Borrower, or (10) to the extent such Confidential Information (i) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section 11.15, or (ii) becomes available to the Administrative Agent, any LC Issuer or any Lender on a non-confidential basis from a source other than a Credit Party and not otherwise in violation of this Section 11.15.
 
(b)                                 As used in this Section, Confidential Information shall mean all information received from the Borrower relating to the Borrower or its business, other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent, any LC Issuer or any Lender on a non-confidential basis prior to disclosure by the Borrower; provided, however, that, in the case of information received from the Borrower after the Closing Date, such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential.
 
(c)                                  Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Confidential Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Confidential Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information. The Borrower hereby agrees that the failure of the Administrative Agent, any LC Issuer or any Lender to comply with the provisions of this

Section shall not relieve the Borrower, or any other Credit Party, of any of its obligations under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents.
 
Section 11.16                                              Limitations on Liability of the LC Issuers.  The Borrower assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee of any Letter of Credit with respect to its use of such Letters of Credit.  Neither any LC Issuer nor any of its officers or directors shall be liable or responsible for: (a) the use that may be made of any Letter of Credit or any acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee in connection therewith; (b) the validity, sufficiency or genuineness of documents, or of any endorsement thereon, even if such documents should prove to be in any or all respects invalid, insufficient, fraudulent or forged; (c) payment by an LC Issuer against presentation of documents that do not comply with the terms of a Letter of Credit, including failure of any documents to bear any reference or adequate reference to such Letter of Credit; or (d) any other circumstances whatsoever in making or failing to make payment under any Letter of Credit, except that the LC Obligor shall have a claim against an LC Issuer, and an LC Issuer shall be liable to such LC Obligor, to the extent of any direct, but not consequential, damages suffered by such LC Obligor that such LC Obligor proves were caused by (i) such LC Issuers willful misconduct or gross negligence in determining whether documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit or (ii) such LC Issuers willful failure to make lawful payment under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it of documentation strictly complying with the terms and conditions of such Letter of Credit.  In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, an LC Issuer may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation.
 
Section 11.17                                              General Limitation of Liability.  No claim may be made by any Credit Party, any Lender, the Administrative Agent, any LC Issuer or any other Person against the Administrative Agent, any LC Issuer, or any other Lender or the Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, attorneys or agents of any of them for any damages other than actual compensatory damages in respect of any claim for breach of contract or any other theory of liability arising out of or related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, or any act, omission or event occurring in connection therewith; and the Borrower, each Lender, the Administrative Agent and each LC Issuer hereby, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, waive, release and agree not to sue or counterclaim upon any such claim for any special, consequential or punitive damages, whether or not accrued and whether or not known or suspected to exist in their favor.
 
Section 11.18                                              No Duty.  All attorneys, accountants, appraisers, consultants and other professional persons (including the firms or other entities on behalf of which any such Person may act) retained by the Administrative Agent or any Lender with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents shall have the right to act exclusively in the interest of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, and shall have no duty of disclosure, duty of loyalty, duty of care, or other duty or obligation of any type or nature whatsoever to the Borrower, to any of its Subsidiaries, or to any other Person, with respect to any matters within the scope of such representation or related to their activities in connection with such representation.  The Borrower agrees, on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries, not to assert any claim or counterclaim against any such persons with regard to such matters.
 
Section 11.19                                              Lenders and Agent Not Fiduciary to Borrower, etc.  The relationship among the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent, each LC Issuer and the Lenders, on the other hand, is solely that of debtor and creditor, and the Administrative Agent, each LC Issuer and the Lenders have no fiduciary or other special relationship with the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, and no term or provision of any Loan Document, no course of dealing, no written or oral communication, or other action, shall be construed so as to deem such relationship to be other than that of debtor and creditor.

Section 11.20                                              Survival of Representations and Warranties.  All representations and warranties herein shall survive the making of Loans and all LC Issuances hereunder, the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Notes and the other documents the forms of which are attached as Exhibits hereto, the issue and delivery of the Notes, any disposition thereof by any holder thereof, and any investigation made by the Administrative Agent or any Lender or any other holder of any of the Notes or on its behalf.
 
Section 11.21                                              Severability.  Any provision of this Agreement held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction.
 
Section 11.22                                              Intentionally Omitted.
 
Section 11.23                                              Interest Rate Limitation.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if at any time the interest rate applicable to any Loan, together with all fees, charges and other amounts that are treated as interest on such Loan under applicable law (collectively, the Charges), shall exceed the maximum lawful rate (the Maximum Rate) that may be contracted for, charged, taken, received or reserved by the Lender holding such Loan in accordance with applicable law, the rate of interest payable in respect of such Loan hereunder, together with all Charges payable in respect thereof, shall be limited to the Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful, the interest and Charges that would have been payable in respect of such Loan but were not payable as a result of the operation of this Section shall be cumulated and the interest and Charges payable to such Lender in respect of other Loans or periods shall be increased (but not above the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount, together with interest thereon at the Base Rate to the date of repayment, shall have been received by such Lender.
 
Section 11.24                                              USA Patriot Act.  Each Lender subject to the USA Patriot Act hereby notifies the Borrower that pursuant to the requirements of the USA Patriot Act, it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Borrower, which information includes the name and address of the Borrower and other information that will allow such Lender to identify the Borrower in accordance with the USA Patriot Act.
 
Section 11.25                                              Advertising and Publicity.  No Credit Party shall issue or disseminate to the public (by advertisement, including without limitation any tombstone advertisement, press release or otherwise), submit for publication or otherwise cause or seek to publish any information describing the credit or other financial accommodations made available by the Lenders pursuant to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent.  Nothing in the foregoing shall be construed to prohibit any Credit Party from making any submission or filing which it is required to make by applicable law or pursuant to judicial process; provided, that, (i) such filing or submission shall contain only such information as is necessary to comply with applicable law or judicial process and (ii) unless specifically prohibited by applicable law or court order, the Borrower shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent of the requirement to make such submission or filing and provide the Administrative Agent with a copy thereof.
 
Section 11.26                                              Release of Guarantees and Liens.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any other Loan Document, the Administrative Agent is hereby irrevocably authorized by each Lender (without requirement of notice to or consent of any Lender) to take any action requested by the Borrower having the effect of releasing any Collateral or guarantee obligations (i) to the extent necessary to permit consummation of any transaction permitted by any Loan Document or that has been consented to in accordance with the terms hereof or (ii) under the circumstances described in the 
 
157





 
next succeeding sentence.  When this Agreement has been terminated and all of the Obligations have been fully and finally discharged (other than obligations in respect of Designated Hedge Agreements, contingent indemnity obligations and obligations in respect of Letters of Credit that have been Cash Collateralized) and the obligations of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders to provide additional credit under the Loan Documents have been terminated irrevocably, the Administrative Agent will, at the Borrowers sole expense, execute and deliver any termination statements, lien releases, mortgage releases, re-assignments of intellectual property, discharges of security interests, and other similar discharge or release documents (and, if applicable, in recordable form) as are necessary or advisable to release, as of record, the Administrative Agents Liens and all notices of security interests and liens previously filed by the Administrative Agent with respect to the Obligations.
 
Section 11.27                                              Payments Set Aside.  To the extent that any Secured Creditor receives a payment from or on behalf of the Borrower or any other Credit Party, from the proceeds of any Collateral, from the exercise of its rights of setoff, any enforcement action or otherwise, and such payment is subsequently, in whole or in part, invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, then to the extent of such recovery, the obligations or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied, and all Liens, rights and remedies therefor, shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not occurred.
 
Section 11.28                                              Hedging Liability.  Notwithstanding any provision hereof or in any other Loan Document to the contrary, in the event that any Credit Party is not an eligible contract participant as such term is defined in Section 1(a)(18) of the Commodity Exchange Act, as amended, at the time (i) any transaction is entered into under any Hedging Obligation or (ii) such Person becomes a Borrower or Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder, and the effect of the foregoing would be to render any Guaranty Obligations of such Person violative of the Commodity Exchange Act, the Obligations of such Person shall not include (x) in the case of clause (i) above, such transaction and (y) in the case of clause (ii) above, any transactions outstanding under any Hedging Obligations as of the date such Person becomes a Borrower or Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder.
 
Section 11.29                                              Acknowledgement and Consent to Bail-In of EEA Financial Institutions.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Loan Document or in any other agreement, arrangement or understanding among any such parties, each party hereto acknowledges that any liability of any EEA Financial Institution arising under any Loan Document, to the extent such liability is unsecured, may be subject to the Write-Down and Conversion Powers of an EEA Resolution Authority and agrees and consents to, and acknowledges and agrees to be bound by:
 
(a)                                 the application of any Write-Down and Conversion Powers by an EEA Resolution Authority to any such liabilities arising hereunder which may be payable to it by any party hereto that is an EEA Financial Institution; and
 
(b)                                 the effects of any Bail-in Action on any such liability, including, if applicab

                                   a reduction in full or in part or cancellation of any such liability;
 
(ii)                                  a conversion of all, or a portion of, such liability into shares or other instruments of ownership in such EEA Financial Institution, its parent undertaking, or a bridge institution that may be issued to it or otherwise conferred on it, and that such shares or other instruments of ownership will be accepted by it in lieu of any rights with respect to any such liability under this Agreement or any other Loan Document; or
 
158





 
(iii)                               the variation of the terms of such liability in connection with the exercise of the write-down and conversion powers of any EEA Resolution Authority.
