SALIX PHARMACEUTICALS, LTD., a Delaware corporation (the <b>Borrower</b>), the Lenders (such term and each other capitalized term used but not defined in this introductory statement having the meaning given it in <u>Article I</u>), PNC
BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, as Issuing Bank, PNC BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, as Swingline Lender, and JEFFERIES FINANCE LLC, as administrative agent (in such capacity, including any successor thereto, the <b>Administrative Agent</b>) and

Borrower has requested the Lenders to extend credit in the form of (a) Term Loans to the Borrower on the Closing Date, in an aggregate principal amount of $1,200,000,000, and (b) Revolving Loans at any time after the Closing Date and from
time to time prior to the Revolving Credit Maturity Date, in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not in excess of $150,000,000. The Borrower has requested the Swingline Lender to extend credit, at any time and from time to time
prior to the Revolving Credit Maturity Date, in the form of Swingline Loans, in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not in excess of $10,000,000. The Borrower has requested the Issuing Banks to issue Letters of Credit, in an
aggregate face amount at any time outstanding not in excess of $25,000,000, to support payment obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business by the Borrower and the Wholly Owned Subsidiaries. The proceeds of the Term Loans are to be used
on the Closing Date, together with at least $820,000,000 of unrestricted cash on the balance sheet of the Borrower (the <b>Existing Acquiror Cash</b>) and the proceeds of the Senior Unsecured Notes, to finance the Acquisition, to
refinance the Existing Target Debt and to pay certain fees and expenses in connection with the Transactions. The proceeds of the Revolving Loans and the Swingline Loans are to be used after the Closing Date solely for working capital and general
corporate purposes of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries (including for a Specified Transaction and other investments and acquisitions permitted by this Agreement). </p>

days after the last day of each fiscal quarter (or within 90 days after the last day of the fourth fiscal quarter). The Quarterly Pricing Certificate shall set forth the calculation of the Total Leverage Ratio as at the last day of the period of
four consecutive fiscal quarters of the Borrower ended immediately prior to the relevant Start Date and the Applicable Margins that shall be thereafter applicable (until such Applicable Margins are changed in accordance with the following
sentences). The Applicable Margins so determined shall apply, except to the extent set forth in the succeeding sentence, from the relevant Start Date to the earlier of (x) the date on which the next Quarterly Pricing Certificate is delivered to

(such earlier date, the <u>End Date</u>), at which time, if no Quarterly Pricing Certificate has been delivered to the Administrative Agent indicating an entitlement to new Applicable Margins (and thus commencing a new Start Date), the
Applicable Margins for such Term Loans shall be those set forth in the table above corresponding to a Total Leverage Ratio of greater than or equal to 3.75:1.00 (such Applicable Margins as so determined, the <u>Highest Applicable

exist any Default or Event of Default and (y) at all times prior to the date of delivery of the financial statements and related Quarterly Pricing Certificate pursuant to <u>Section 5.04(b)</u> for the fiscal quarter ending June 30,
2014, and (B) the Applicable Margins for such Term Loans shall be increased as, and to the extent, necessary to comply with <u>Section 2.24(b)</u>. </p>

that is less than that which would have been applicable had the Total Leverage Ratio been accurately determined, then, for all purposes of this Agreement, the Applicable Margin for any day occurring within the period covered by such
Quarterly Pricing Certificate shall retroactively be deemed to be the relevant percentage as based upon the accurately determined Total Leverage Ratio for such period, and any shortfall in the interest theretofore paid by the Borrower for the
