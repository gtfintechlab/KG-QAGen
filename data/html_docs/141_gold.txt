SECTION 2.05  Prepayment and Repayment of Loans.
 
(a)          Voluntary Prepayments.  The Borrower may, upon notice to the Administrative Agent, at any time and from time to time voluntarily prepay Loans in whole or in part without premium or penalty; provided that (i) such notice must be in a form reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. (A) three Business Days prior to any date of prepayment of LIBOR Rate Loans and (B) on the date of prepayment of Base Rate Loans; and (ii) any partial prepayment of shall be in a principal amount of $5,000,000 (or, if less, the total amount of the Loans outstanding) or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof.  Each such notice shall specify the date and amount of such prepayment and the Type(s) of Loans to be prepaid and, if LIBOR Loans are to be prepaid, the Interest Period(s) of such Loans.  The Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Lender of its receipt of each such notice, and of the amount of such Lender’s ratable portion of such prepayment (based on such Lender’s Commitment Percentage).  If such notice is given by the Borrower, the Borrower shall make such prepayment and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein.  Subject to Section 2.15, each prepayment of the outstanding Loans pursuant to this Section 2.05(a) shall be paid to the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitment Percentages and shall be applied first to Base Rate Loans until paid in full and second to LIBOR Rate Loans, in direct order of Interest Period maturities until paid in full.

21




 
(b)          Repayment.  The Borrower shall repay to the Lenders on the Maturity Date the aggregate principal amount of Loans outstanding on such date, together with accrued interest to the date of such payment on the principal amount repaid.
 
SECTION 2.06  Incremental Facilities.
 
(a)          Request for Incremental Facility.  Upon notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly notify the Lenders), at any time after the Closing Date, the Borrower may request the additional Borrowing of a new tranche of term loans (each tranche, an “Incremental Facility”); provided that (i) after giving effect to any such additional Borrowing, the aggregate principal amount of Incremental Facilities that have been added pursuant to this Section 2.06 shall not exceed $200,000,000, (ii) any such additional Borrowing shall be in an aggregate principal amount of not less than $25,000,000 or any whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof (or, in either case, such lesser amount as may be acceptable to the Administrative Agent), and (iii) there shall be no more than three such requested additional Borrowings during the term of this Agreement.

(c)          Notices; Lender Elections.  Each notice from the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.06 shall set forth the requested amount and proposed terms of the Incremental Facility.  Loans with respect to any Incremental Facility may be made by any existing Lender or by any other bank or financial institution selected by the Borrower that is reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent (any such existing Lender or other bank or other financial institution providing such loans, an “Incremental Lender”), in each case on terms permitted in this Section 2.06.  At the time of the sending of such notice, the Borrower (in consultation with the Administrative Agent) shall specify the time period within which each Lender is requested to respond (which shall in no event be less than twenty Business Days from the date of delivery of such notice to the Lenders).  No Lender shall be obligated to provide any portion of any Incremental Facility.  Each Lender shall notify the Administrative Agent within such time period whether it agrees to provide a portion of such Incremental Facility and, if so, the amount thereof.  Any Lender not responding within such time period shall be deemed to have declined to provide any portion of such Incremental Facility.  The Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and each Lender of the Lenders’ responses to each request made hereunder.  To achieve the full amount of a requested Incremental Facility, the Borrower may also invite any other bank or financial institution that is reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent to become a Lender thereunder.
 
(d)          Incremental Facility Amendment.  Each Incremental Facility shall become a facility under this Agreement pursuant to an amendment (each, an “Incremental Facility Amendment”) to this Agreement and, as appropriate, the other Loan Documents, executed by the Borrower, each Incremental Lender and the Administrative Agent.  An Incremental Facility Amendment may, without the consent of any other Lenders, effect such amendments to the Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the opinion of the Administrative Agent, to effect the provisions of this Section 2.06 (including, without limitation, to incorporate the loans and commitments under any Incremental Facility into the calculation of the “Required Lenders” and “Commitment Percentages” and provisions related to the sharing of payments, prepayments and voting).  Upon execution, the Administrative Agent shall provide a copy of any Incremental Facility Amendment to all Lenders.
 

22




 
(e)          Effective Date and Allocations.  If any Incremental Facility is added in accordance with this Section 2.06, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall determine the effective date (each, an “Incremental Facility Effective Date”) and the final allocation thereof.  The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower, the existing Lenders and the Incremental Lenders of the final allocation of such Incremental Facility and the Incremental Facility Effective Date.
 
(f)          Conditions to Effectiveness.  The effectiveness of any Incremental Facility Amendment shall, unless otherwise agreed to by the Administrative Agent and each Incremental Lender, be subject to the satisfaction on the Incremental Facility Effective Date of each of the following conditions:
 
(i)           the Administrative Agent shall have received on or prior to the Incremental Facility Effective Date each of the following, each dated the applicable Incremental Facility Effective Date and each in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent:  (A) the applicable Incremental Facility Amendment; (B) a certificate of a duly authorized office of the Borrower dated as of the Incremental Facility Effective Date certifying (1) as to true and correct copies of the resolutions adopted by the board of directors of the Borrower approving or consenting to the Incremental Facility Amendment and the Incremental Facility provided thereby, (2) that all necessary Governmental Approvals with respect to the Incremental Facility Amendment and the Incremental Facility provided thereby have been received and, if applicable, as to true and correct copies thereof and (3) that, before and after giving effect to the Incremental Facility Amendment and the Incremental Facility provided thereby, the representations and warranties are true and correct in all material respects (except for representations and warranties qualified by materiality or Material Adverse Effect, which shall be true and correct in all respects) on and as of the Incremental Facility Effective Date, and, on and as of the Incremental Facility Effective Date, no Default or Event of Default exists or will result from the Incremental Facility or from the application of the proceeds thereof; and (C) such opinions of counsel for the Borrower with respect to the Incremental Facility Amendment and the Incremental Facility provided thereby as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request; and
 
(ii)          there shall have been paid to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders (including any Person becoming a Lender as part of such Incremental Facility Amendment), as applicable, all fees and expenses (including reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees, charges and disbursements of counsel) that are due and payable on or before the Incremental Facility Effective Date.
 
(g)          Conflicting Provisions.  This Section 2.06 shall supersede any provisions in Section 8.01 to the contrary.
 
SECTION 2.07  Evidence of Debt; Notes.
 
(a)          Evidence of Debt.  The date, amount, type, interest rate and duration of Interest Period (if applicable) of each Loan made by each Lender to the Borrower, and each payment made on account of the principal thereof, shall be recorded by such Lender and by the Administrative Agent on its books; provided that the failure of such Lender or the Administrative Agent to make any such recordation or endorsement shall not affect the obligations of the Borrower to make a payment when due of any amount owing hereunder or under any Note with respect of the Loans to be evidenced by such Note, and each such recordation or endorsement shall be conclusive and binding, absent manifest error.  In any legal action or proceeding in respect of this Agreement, the entries made in such account or accounts shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive evidence of the existence and amounts of the Obligations of the Borrower therein recorded.  In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error.
 

23




 
(b)          Notes.  Upon the request of any Lender to the Borrower made through the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative Agent) a Note, which shall evidence such Lender’s Loans to the Borrower in addition to such accounts or records.  Each Lender may attach schedules to a Note and endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount, and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto.
 
SECTION 2.08  Interest Rates.
 
(a)          Interest Rates.  Subject to the provisions of this Section, at the election of the Borrower, Loans shall bear interest at (i) the Base Rate plus the Applicable Base Rate Margin or (ii) the LIBOR Rate plus the Applicable LIBOR Margin (provided that the LIBOR Rate shall not be available until three (3) Business Days after the Closing Date unless the Borrower has delivered to the Administrative Agent a letter in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent indemnifying the Lenders in the manner set forth in Section 2.09(e)).  The Borrower shall select the Type of Loan and Interest Period, if any, applicable to any Borrowing at the time a Notice of Borrowing is given or at the time a Notice of Conversion/Continuation is given pursuant to Section 2.10.  Any Borrowing as to which the Borrower has not duly specified the Type of Loans in a Notice of Borrowing, or as to which the Borrower has not given a timely Notice of Conversion/Continuation, in each case as provided herein, shall be made as, or Converted to, a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans.
 
(b)          Interest Periods.  As used herein, “Interest Period” means, as to each LIBOR Rate Loan, the period commencing on the date of such LIBOR Rate Loan is disbursed or Converted to a LIBOR Rate Loan and ending on the date that is one, two, three or six months thereafter (in each case subject to availability), as the Borrower may select by notice to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 2.02(a)(ii) or 2.10; provided, however, that:
 
(i)           the Borrower may not select any Interest Period with respect to any Borrowing that ends after the Maturity Date, and in no event shall an Interest Period of any Borrowing extend beyond the Maturity Date;
 
(ii)          whenever the last day of any Interest Period would otherwise occur on a day other than a Business Day, the last day of such Interest Period shall be extended to occur on the next succeeding Business Day; provided that if such extension would cause the last day of such Interest Period to occur in the next following calendar month, the last day of such Interest Period shall occur on the next preceding Business Day; and
 
(iii)          any Interest Period for a LIBOR Rate Loan which begins on the last Business Day of a calendar month (or on a day for which there is no numerically corresponding day in the appropriate subsequent calendar month) shall end on the last Business Day of the appropriate subsequent calendar month; and
 

24




 
(iv)          no more than eight (8) Interest Periods may be in effect at any time.
 
(c)          Default Rate.  Subject to Section 6.02, immediately upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, (i) the Borrower shall no longer have the option to request LIBOR Rate Loans, (ii) all outstanding LIBOR Rate Loans shall bear interest at a rate per annum of two percent (2%) in excess of the rate (including the Applicable LIBOR Margin) then applicable to such LIBOR Rate Loans until the end of the applicable Interest Period and thereafter shall be automatically converted to Base Rate Loans and shall bear interest at a rate equal to two percent (2%) in excess of the rate (including the Applicable Base Rate Margin) then applicable to Base Rate Loans, and (iii) all outstanding Base Rate Loans and other Obligations arising hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to two percent (2%) in excess of the rate (including the Applicable Base Rate Margin) then applicable to Base Rate Loans or such other Obligations arising hereunder or under any other Loan Document.  Interest shall continue to accrue on the Obligations after the filing by or against the Borrower of any petition seeking any relief in bankruptcy or under any act or law pertaining to insolvency or debtor relief, whether state, federal or foreign.
 
(d)          Interest Payment and Computation.  In addition to such other times as may be specified herein, (i) interest on each Base Rate Loan shall be due and payable in arrears on the last Business Day of each calendar quarter commencing March 31, 2017; and (ii) interest on each LIBOR Rate Loan shall be due and payable on the last day of each Interest Period applicable thereto, and if such Interest Period extends over three (3) months, at the end of each three (3)-month interval during such Interest Period.  All computations of interest for Base Rate Loans shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed.  All other computations of fees and interest provided hereunder shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed (which results in more fees or interest, as applicable, being paid than if computed on the basis of a 365/366-day year).
 
(e)          Payments.  Each payment by the Borrower on account of the principal of or interest on the Loans or of any fee, commission or other amounts payable to the Administrative Agent or the Lenders under this Agreement (or any of them) shall be made not later than 1:00 p.m. (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania time) on the date specified for payment under this Agreement to the Administrative Agent at the office of the Administrative Agent as set forth in Section 8.02 (the “Administrative Agent’s Office”) for the account of the Lenders entitled to such payment in Dollars, in immediately available funds and shall be made without any set off, counterclaim or deduction whatsoever.  Any payment received after such time but before 2:00 p.m. on such day shall be deemed a payment on such date for the purposes of Section 6.01, but for all other purposes shall be deemed to have been made on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue.  Any payment received after 2:00 p.m. shall be deemed to have been made on the next succeeding Business Day for all purposes and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue.  Upon receipt by the Administrative Agent of each such payment, the Administrative Agent shall distribute to each Lender at its address for notices set forth herein its pro rata share of such payment in accordance with the amounts then due and payable to such Lender (except as specified below), and shall wire advice of the amount of such credit to each Lender.  Each payment to the Administrative Agent of the Administrative Agent’s fees or expenses shall be made for the account of the Administrative Agent and any amount payable to any Lender under Sections 2.09(e), 2.11, 2.13, 8.05 or 8.06 shall be paid to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Lender.  If any payment under this Agreement shall be specified to be made upon a day which is not a Business Day, it shall be made on the next succeeding day which is a Business Day and such extension of time shall in such case be included in computing any interest if payable along with such payment.
 

25




 
(f)          Maximum Rate.  In no contingency or event whatsoever shall the aggregate amount of all amounts deemed interest hereunder or under any of the Notes charged or collected pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or pursuant to any of the Notes exceed the highest rate permissible under any Applicable Law which a court of competent jurisdiction shall, in a final determination, deem applicable hereto.  In the event that such a court determines that the Lenders have charged or received interest hereunder in excess of the highest applicable rate, the rate in effect hereunder shall automatically be reduced to the maximum rate permitted by Applicable Law and the Lenders shall, at the Administrative Agent’s option, promptly refund to the Borrower any interest received by the Lenders in excess of the maximum lawful rate or shall apply such excess to the principal balance of the Obligations.  It is the intent hereof that the Borrower not pay or contract to pay, and that neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender receive or contract to receive, directly or indirectly in any manner whatsoever, interest in excess of that which may be paid by the Borrower under Applicable Law.
 
SECTION 2.09  Interest Rate Determination; Changed Circumstances.
 
(a)          Interest Rate Determination.  The Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice to the Borrower and the Lenders of the applicable interest rate determined by the Administrative Agent for purposes of Section 2.08.
 
(b)          Automatic Conversion.  If the Borrower shall fail to (i) select the duration of any Interest Period for any LIBOR Rate Loans in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.08(b), (ii) provide a Notice of Conversion/Continuation with respect to any LIBOR Rate Loans on or prior to 11:00 a.m., Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania time, on the third Business Day prior to the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, in the case of a Conversion to LIBOR Rate Loans or (iii) satisfy the conditions set forth in Section 2.10 with respect to a Conversion, the Administrative Agent will forthwith so notify the Borrower and the Lenders and such LIBOR Rate Loans will automatically, on the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into Base Rate Loans.
 
(c)          Circumstances Affecting LIBOR Rate Availability.  If, with respect to any LIBOR Rate Loans (or a conversion to or continuation thereof), (i) the Administrative Agent shall determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding, absent manifest error) that Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in the London interbank Eurodollar market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such LIBOR Rate Loan, (ii) the Required Lenders notify the Administrative Agent or the Administrative Agent shall determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding, absent manifest error) that reasonable and adequate means do not exist for ascertaining the LIBOR Rate for such Interest Period with respect to such LIBOR Rate Loan or (iii) the Required Lenders shall determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding, absent manifest error) and notify the Administrative Agent that the LIBOR Rate for any Interest Period for such LIBOR Rate Loans will not adequately reflect the cost to such Required Lenders of making, funding or maintaining such LIBOR Rate Loans for such Interest Period, then the Administrative Agent shall forthwith so notify the Borrower and the Lenders, whereupon:
 
(i)            each LIBOR Rate Loan will automatically, on the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into a Base Rate Loan, and
 
(ii)           the obligation of the Lenders to make, or to Convert Loans into, LIBOR Rate Loans shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent (based on notice from the Required Lenders) shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist.
 

26




 
(d)          Laws Affecting LIBOR Rate Availability.  If, after the date hereof, the introduction of, or any change in, any Applicable Law or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any of the Lenders (or any of their respective Lending Offices) with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency, shall make it unlawful or impossible for any of the Lenders (or any of their respective Lending Offices) to honor its obligations hereunder to make or maintain any LIBOR Rate Loan or to determine interest by reference to LIBOR, such Lender shall promptly give notice thereof to the Administrative Agent and the Administrative Agent shall promptly give notice to the Borrower and the other Lenders.  Thereafter, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower that such circumstances no longer exist, which notification shall be sent by the Administrative Agent within five Business Days after the Administrative Agent receives written notification from such Lender that such circumstances no longer exist, (i) the obligations of the Lenders to make LIBOR Rate Loans or Convert any Loan to a LIBOR Rate Loan, and the right of the Borrower to borrow any LIBOR Rate Loan or Convert any Loan to a LIBOR Rate Loan, shall be suspended and (ii) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or maintaining Base Rate Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the LIBOR component of the Base Rate, the interest rate on Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the LIBOR component of the Base Rate.  Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), Convert all LIBOR Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the LIBOR Rate component of the Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such LIBOR Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such LIBOR Rate Loans.
 
(e)          Indemnity.  The Borrower hereby indemnifies each of the Lenders against any loss or expense which may arise or be attributable to such Lender’s obtaining, liquidating or employing deposits or other funds acquired to effect, fund or maintain any Loan (i) as a consequence of any failure by the Borrower to make any payment when due of any amount due hereunder in connection with a LIBOR Rate Loan, (ii) due to any failure of the Borrower to borrow or Convert on a date specified therefor in a Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation or (iii) due to any payment, prepayment or Conversion of any LIBOR Rate Loan on a date other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor.  The amount of such loss or expense shall be determined, in the applicable Lender’s reasonable discretion, based upon the assumption that such Lender funded its LIBOR Rate Loans in the London interbank market and using any reasonable attribution or averaging methods which such Lender deems appropriate and practical.  A certificate of such Lender setting forth the basis for determining such amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender shall be forwarded to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent and shall be conclusively presumed to be correct, absent manifest error.  Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of the Borrower hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders contained in this Section shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of the Aggregate Commitments.
 

27




 
SECTION 2.10  Voluntary Conversion of Loans.
 
The Borrower may on any Business Day, by delivering an irrevocable Notice of Conversion/Continuation (a “Notice of Conversion/Continuation”) in the form of Exhibit D hereto to the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m., Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania time, on the third Business Day prior to the date of the proposed Conversion, and subject to the provisions of Section 2.08, Convert Loans of one Type into Loans of the other Type or Convert LIBOR Rate Loans as LIBOR Rate Loans; provided that (a) any Conversion of any LIBOR Rate Loans into Base Rate Loans or as LIBOR Rate Loans shall be made on, and only on, the last day of an Interest Period for such LIBOR Rate Loans and (b) each Conversion shall be in an aggregate principal amount of $5,000,000 (or, if less, the total amount of the Loans outstanding) or any multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof.
 
SECTION 2.11  Increased Costs.
 
(a)          Increased Costs Generally.  If any Change in Law shall:
 
(i)           impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or advances, loans or other credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement reflected in the LIBOR Rate);
 
(ii)          subject any Lender to any Tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to this Agreement or any Loan made by it, or change the basis of taxation of payments to such Lender in respect thereof (except for Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes covered by Section 2.13 and the imposition of, or any change in the rate of any Excluded Tax payable by such Lender); or
 
(iii)          impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or LIBOR Rate Loans made by such Lender;
 
and the result of the foregoing shall be in the aggregate to increase the cost to such Lender of making, converting into or maintaining any Loan the interest on which is determined by reference to the LIBOR Rate or the Daily LIBOR Rate (or, in the case of clause (ii) above, any Loan), or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon written request of such Lender, the Borrower shall promptly pay to any such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.  Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of the Borrower hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders contained in this Section shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of the Aggregate Commitments.
 
(b)          Capital Requirements.  If any Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or any lending office of such Lender or such Lender’s holding company, if any, regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s capital or on the capital of such Lender’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitment of such Lender or the Loans made by such Lender to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender’s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s policies and the policies of such Lender’s holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time upon written request of such Lender the Borrower shall promptly pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender’s holding company for any such reduction suffered.  Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of the Borrower hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders contained in this Section shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of the Aggregate Commitments.
 

28




 
(c)          Certificates for Reimbursement.  A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsections (a) or (b) of this Section and delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.  The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within ten (10) days after receipt thereof.
 
(d)          Delay in Requests.  Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine (9) months prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender’s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).
 
SECTION 2.12  Nature of Obligations of Lenders Regarding Extensions of Credit; Assumption by the Administrative Agent.
 
The obligations of the Lenders under this Agreement to make Loans and to make payments pursuant to Section 8.07(b) are several and are not joint or joint and several.  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to a proposed date of any Borrowing of LIBOR Rate Loans (or, in the case of any Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, prior to 12:00 noon, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania time, on the date of such Borrowing) that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender’s ratable portion of such Borrowing (which notice shall not release such Lender of its obligations hereunder), the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such portion available to the Administrative Agent on the proposed date of such Borrowing in accordance with this Agreement and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, but shall not be required to, make available to the Borrower on such date a corresponding amount.  If the Administrative Agent elects to make such amount available to the Borrower on such date, and such amount is made available to the Administrative Agent on a date after such borrowing date, such Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent on demand an amount, until paid, equal to the product of (a) the amount not made available by such Lender in accordance with the terms hereof, times (b) the daily average Federal Funds Rate (or, if such amount is not made available for a period of three (3) Business Days after the borrowing date, the Base Rate) during such period as determined by the Administrative Agent, times (c) a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days that elapse from and including such borrowing date to the date on which such amount not made available by such Lender in accordance with the terms hereof shall have become immediately available to the Administrative Agent and the denominator of which is 360.  A certificate of the Administrative Agent with respect to any amounts owing under this Section 2.12 shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.  If such Lender’s Commitment Percentage of such Borrowing is not made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender within three (3) Business Days of such borrowing date, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such amount made available by the Administrative Agent with interest thereon at the rate per annum applicable to the Loan hereunder, on demand, from the Borrower.  The failure of any Lender to make any Loan or make any payment pursuant to Section 8.07(b) on any date required hereunder shall not relieve such Lender or any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan or to make its payment under Section 8.07(b).
 

29




 
SECTION 2.13  Taxes; Foreign Lenders.
 
(a)          Payments Free of Taxes.  Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without reduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by Applicable Law; provided that if the Borrower shall be required by Applicable Law to deduct any Taxes (including any Other Taxes) from such payments, then (i) the Borrower shall make such deductions, (ii) the Borrower shall timely pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with Applicable Law and (iii) if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent, the applicable Lender or Issuing Lender, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made.
 
(b)          Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower.  Without limiting the provisions of subsection (a) above, the Borrower shall timely pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with Applicable Law.
 
(c)          Indemnification by the Borrower.  The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) paid by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.
 
(d)          Evidence of Payments.  As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
 
(e)          Status of Lenders.  Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the Borrower is resident for tax purposes, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by Applicable Law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by Applicable Law as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding.  In addition, any Lender, if requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by Applicable Law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that the Borrower is a resident for tax purposes in the United States, any Foreign Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, but only if such Foreign Lender is legally entitled to do so), any or all of the following which is applicable:
 

30




 
(i)           duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Forms W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, as applicable, claiming eligibility for benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party and/or allowing for payments to be made without withholding due to the applicability of FATCA,
 
(ii)          duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI,
 
(iii)          in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under section 881(c) of the Code, (A) a certificate to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not (I) a “bank” within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (II) a “10 percent shareholder” of the Borrower within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or (III) a “controlled foreign corporation” described in section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code and (B) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, as applicable, or
 
(iv)          any other form prescribed by Applicable Law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in United States Federal withholding tax duly completed together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by Applicable Law to permit the Borrower to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made.
 
If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.  Solely for purposes of this subsection (e), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.


Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered pursuant to this subsection (e) expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.
 

31




 
(f)          Treatment of Certain Refunds.  If the Administrative Agent or a Lender determines, in its reasonable discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section, it shall promptly after the receipt of such refund pay to the Borrower an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); provided that the Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is finally required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.  This subsection shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.
 
(g)          Survival.  Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of the Borrower hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders contained in this Section shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of the Aggregate Commitments.
 
(h)          USA Patriot Act Notice; Compliance.  In order for the Administrative Agent to comply with the Patriot Act, prior to any Lender or Participant that is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside of the United States of America becoming a party hereto, the Administrative Agent may request, and such Lender or Participant shall provide to the Administrative Agent, its name, address, tax identification number and/or such other identification information as shall be necessary for the Administrative Agent to comply with federal law.
 
SECTION 2.14  Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.
 
(a)          Designation of a Different Applicable Lending Office.  If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.11, or requires the Borrower to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.13, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.11 or Section 2.13, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender.  The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
 
(b)          Replacement of Lenders.  If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.11, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.13 and, in each case, such Lender has declined or is unable to designate a different lending office in accordance with Section 2.14(a) to eliminate amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.11 or Section 2.13, as the case may be, in the future, or if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender or a Non-Consenting Lender, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 8.08), all of its interests, rights (other than its rights under Section 2.11, Section 2.13, Section 8.05 and Section 8.06 that may be applicable prior to such assignment) and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment provided that such Lender is not a Defaulting Lender at the time of such assignment); provided that:
 

32




 
(i)           the Borrower shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the assignment fee specified in Section 8.08;
 
(ii)          such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under Section 2.09(e) as if such assignment was a payment) from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts);
 
(iii)          in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.11 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.13, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter;
 
(iv)          such assignment does not conflict with Applicable Law; and
 
(v)          in the case of any assignment resulting from a Lender becoming a Non-Consenting Lender, the applicable assignee shall have consented to the applicable amendment, waiver or consent.
 
A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.
 
SECTION 2.15  Defaulting Lenders.
 
(a)          Defaulting Lender Adjustments.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as such Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law:
 
(i)           Waivers and Amendments.  Such Defaulting Lender’s right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in Section 8.01 and in the definition of Required Lenders.
 

33




 
(ii)           Defaulting Lender Waterfall.  Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Article VI or otherwise) or received by the Administrative Agent from a Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 8.04 shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder; second, as the Borrower may request (so long as no Default or Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent; third, if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to be held in a deposit account and released pro rata in order to satisfy such Defaulting Lender’s potential future funding obligations with respect to Loans under this Agreement; fourth, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; fifth, so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and sixth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if (A) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share, and (B) such Loans were made at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 3.02 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of all Non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of such Defaulting Lender until such time as all Loans are held by the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the Commitments.  Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender pursuant to this Section 2.15(a)(ii) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents thereto.
 
(iii)          Unused Fee. Such Defaulting Lender shall not be entitled to receive any Unused  Fee for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and the Borrower shall not be required to pay any such Unused Fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender).
 
(b)          Defaulting Lender Cure.  If the Borrower and the Administrative Agent agree in writing that a Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein, that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans to be held pro rata by the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitment Percentages, whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender’s having been a Defaulting Lender.
 
(c)          Termination of Defaulting Lender.  The Borrower may terminate the unused amount of the Commitment of any Lender that is a Defaulting Lender upon not less than five (5) Business Days’ prior notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly notify the Lenders thereof), and in such event the provisions of Section 2.15(a)(ii) will apply to all amounts thereafter paid by the Borrower for the account of such Defaulting Lender under this Agreement (whether on account of principal, interest, fees, indemnity or other amounts); provided that (i) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, and (ii) such termination shall not be deemed to be a waiver or release of any claim the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have against such Defaulting Lender.

SECTION 6.04  Rights and Remedies Cumulative; Non-Waiver; Etc.
 
The enumeration of the rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders set forth in this Agreement is not intended to be exhaustive, and the exercise by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders of any right or remedy shall not preclude the exercise of any other rights or remedies, all of which shall be cumulative, and shall be in addition to any other right or remedy given hereunder or that may now or hereafter exist in law or in equity or by suit or otherwise.  No delay or failure to take action on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender in exercising any right, power or privilege shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege preclude other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege or shall be construed to be a waiver of any Event of Default.  No course of dealing between the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders or their respective agents or employees shall be effective to change, modify or discharge any provision of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or to constitute a waiver of any Default or Event of Default.
 
ARTICLE VII

 THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT
 
SECTION 7.01  Appointment and Authority.
 
Each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably designates and appoints PNC to act on its behalf as the Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.  The provisions of this Article are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary thereof shall have rights as a third party beneficiary of any of such provisions.
 
SECTION 7.02  Rights as a Lender.
 
The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent and the term “Lender” or “Lenders” shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity.  Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.
 
SECTION 7.03  Exculpatory Provisions.
 
The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent:
 
(a)          shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing;
 

52




 
(b)          shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents), provided that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law, including for the avoidance of doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any Debtor Relief Law or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any Debtor Relief Law; and
 
(c)          shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.
 
The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Section 8.01) or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final nonappealable judgment.  The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default or Event of Default unless and until notice describing such Default or Event of Default is given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower or a Lender.
 
The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article III or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.
 
SECTION 7.04  Reliance by Administrative Agent.
 
The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person.  The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon.  In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender prior to the making of such Loan.  The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
 

53




 
SECTION 7.05  Delegation of Duties.
 
The Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties.  The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the facilities created under this Agreement as well as activities as Agent.
 
SECTION 7.06  Resignation of Administrative Agent.
 
The Administrative Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders and the Borrower.  Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the Borrower, to appoint a successor, which shall be (a) a bank with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States and (b) a U.S. Person within the meaning of the Code.  If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above, provided that if the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that no qualifying Person has accepted such appointment, then such resignation shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice and (a) the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (except that in the case of any collateral security held by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders under any of the Loan Documents, the retiring Administrative Agent shall continue to hold such collateral security until such time as a successor Administrative Agent is appointed) and (b) all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender directly, until such time as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided for above in this Section.  Upon the acceptance of a successor’s appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or retired) Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this Section).  The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor.  After the retiring Administrative Agent’s resignation hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article and Sections 8.05, 8.06 and 8.07 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring Administrative Agent was acting as Administrative Agent.
 
SECTION 7.07  Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Lenders.
 
Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement.  Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.
 

54




 
SECTION 7.08  No Other Duties, Etc.
 
Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none of the syndication agents, documentation agents, co-agents, book runners, lead arrangers, or co-arrangers listed on the cover page or signature pages hereof shall have any powers, duties or responsibilities under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, except in its capacity, as applicable, as the Administrative Agent or a Lender hereunder.
 
SECTION 7.09  No Reliance on Administrative Agent’s Customer Identification Program.
 
Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that neither such Lender, nor any of its Affiliates, participants or assignees, may rely on the Administrative Agent to carry out such Lender’s, Affiliate’s, participant’s or assignee’s customer identification program, or other obligations required or imposed under or pursuant to the Patriot Act or the regulations thereunder, including the regulations contained in 31 CFR 103.121 (as hereafter amended or replaced, the “CIP Regulations”), or any other AML and Anti-Terrorist Acts, including any programs involving any of the following items relating to or in connection with any of the Borrower, its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or their respective agents, the Loan Documents or the transactions hereunder or contemplated hereby: (a) any identity verification procedures, (b) any recordkeeping, (c) comparisons with government lists, (d) customer notices or (e) other procedures required under the CIP Regulations or such other AML and Anti-Terrorist Acts.

SECTION 8.01  Amendments, Etc.

57




 
SECTION 8.04  Set-off; Sharing of Payments by Lenders.
 
(a)          Set-off.  If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Administrative Agent, each Lender and each of their respective Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, in whatever currency) at any time held and other obligations (in whatever currency) at any time owing by the Administrative Agent, such Lender or any such Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower against any and all of the Obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Agreement or any other Loan Document to the Administrative Agent, such Lender or any such Affiliate, irrespective of whether or not the Administrative Agent, such Lender or any such Affiliate shall have made any demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and although such Obligations of the Borrower may be contingent or unmatured or are owed to a branch, office or Affiliate of the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Affiliate different from the branch, office or Affiliate holding such deposit or obligated on such indebtedness; provided that in the event that any Defaulting Lender shall exercise any such right of setoff, (i) all amounts so set off shall be paid over immediately to the Administrative Agent for further application in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.15 and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and (ii) the Defaulting Lender shall provide promptly to the Administrative Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the Obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as to which it exercised such right of setoff.  The rights of each Lender and its Affiliates under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that such Lender or its Affiliates may have.  Each Lender agrees to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent promptly after any such setoff and application; provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application.     
 
(b)          Sharing of Payments by Lenders.  If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans or other obligations hereunder resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and accrued interest thereon or other such obligations greater than its pro rata share thereof as provided herein, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (i) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (ii) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and such other obligations of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and other amounts owing them; provided that:
 
(i)           if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and
 
(ii)          the provisions of this subsection (b) shall not be construed to apply to (A) any payment made by or on behalf of the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender), or (B) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply).
 

58




 
The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.
 
SECTION 8.05  Indemnification.
 
The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent (and any sub-agent thereof), each Arranger, each Lender and each Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an “Indemnitee”) against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, and shall pay or reimburse any such Indemnitee for, any and all losses, claims (including, without limitation, any Environmental Claims or civil penalties or fines assessed by OFAC), damages, liabilities and related reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee), incurred by any Indemnitee or asserted against any Indemnitee by any third party or by the Borrower arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (a) the execution or delivery of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby, the performance by the parties hereto of their respective obligations hereunder or thereunder or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, (b) any Loan or the use or proposed use of the proceeds therefrom, (c) any actual or alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials (including any Environmental Release) on or from any property owned or operated by the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof, or any Environmental Claim related in any way to the Borrower or any Subsidiary, (d) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory, whether brought by a third party or by the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof, and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto, or (e) any claim (including, without limitation, any Environmental Claims or civil penalties or fines assessed by the U.S.  Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control), investigation, litigation or other proceeding (whether or not the Administrative Agent or any Lender is a party thereto) and the prosecution and defense thereof, arising out of or in any way connected with the Loans, this Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including without limitation, reasonable attorneys and consultant’s fees, provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses (i) are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of an Indemnitee or (ii) result from a claim brought by the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof against an Indemnitee for breach in bad faith of such Indemnitee’s obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document, if the Borrower or such Subsidiary has obtained a final and nonappealable judgment in its favor on such claim as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction.  An Indemnitee shall not, without the prior written consent of the Borrower (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), effect any settlement of any pending or threatened claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding in respect of which indemnity is sought under this Section 8.05 by such Indemnitee unless such settlement (x) does not require the Borrower to make any payments or assume any liabilities (including related to any claims for indemnification under this Agreement), (y) includes an unconditional release of the Borrower in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding and (z) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of the Borrower.
 

59




 
Nothing in this Section 8.05 is intended to limit the Borrower’s obligations contained in Article II.  Without prejudice to the survival of any other obligation of the Borrower hereunder, the indemnities and obligations of the Borrower contained in this Section 8.05 shall survive the payment in full of amounts payable pursuant to Article II and the termination of the Aggregate Commitments.
 
SECTION 8.06  Costs, Expenses and Taxes.
 
The Borrower agrees to pay on demand all reasonable costs and expenses in connection with the preparation, issuance, delivery, filing, recording, and administration of this Agreement, the Loans and any other documents which may be delivered in connection with this Agreement, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and out-of-pocket expenses of counsel for the Administrative Agent incurred in connection with the preparation and negotiation of this Agreement, the Loans and any document delivered in connection therewith and all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent (and, in the case of clause (c) or (d) below, any Lender) (including reasonable fees and out of pocket expenses of counsel) in connection with (a) with the use of Intralinks Inc., SyndTrak or other similar information transmission systems in connection with the Loan Documents, (b) the transfer, drawing upon, change in terms, maintenance, renewal or cancellation of this Agreement and the Loans, (c) any and all amounts which the Administrative Agent or any Lender has paid relative to the Administrative Agent’s or such Lender’s curing of any Event of Default resulting from the acts or omissions of the Borrower under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (d) the enforcement of, or protection of rights under, this Agreement or any other Loan Document (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) or (e) any waivers or consents or amendments to or in respect of this Agreement, the other Loan Documents or the Loans requested by the Borrower.  In addition, the Borrower shall pay any and all stamp and other taxes and fees payable or determined to be payable in connection with the execution, delivery, filing and recording of this Agreement, the Loans or any of such other documents, and agree to save the Administrative Agent and the Lenders harmless from and against any and all liabilities with respect to or resulting from any delay in paying or omission to pay such taxes and fees.
 
Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of the Borrower hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the Borrower contained in this Section shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of the Aggregate Commitments.
 
SECTION 8.07  Waiver of Consequential Damages; Reimbursement by Lenders.
 
(a)          Waiver of Consequential Damages, Etc.  To the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, the Borrower shall not assert, and hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, and no Indemnitee shall assert, and each Indemnitee hereby waives, any claim against the Borrower, in each case on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, any Loan or the use of the proceeds thereof.  No Indemnitee shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by unintended recipients of any information or other materials distributed by it through telecommunications, electronic or other information transmission systems in connection with this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.
 

60




 
(b)          Reimbursement by Lenders.  To the extent that the Borrower for any reason fails to indefeasibly pay any amount required under Sections 8.05 or 8.06 to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent (or any sub-agent thereof) or any Related Party thereof, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent) or such Related Party, as the case may be, such Lender’s Commitment Percentage (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount, provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent) in its capacity as such, or against any such Related Party acting for the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent) in connection with such capacity.  All amounts due under this Section 8.07(b) shall be payable not later than ten (10) days after demand therefor.
 
(c)          Survival.  The agreements and obligations of the Borrower and the Lenders contained in this Section 8.07 shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of the Aggregate Commitments.
 
SECTION 8.08  Benefit of Agreement.
 
(a)          Successors and Assigns Generally.  The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and each Lender and no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder except (i) to an assignee in accordance with the provisions of subsection (b) of this Section, (ii) by way of participation in accordance with the provisions of subsection (d) of this Section or (iii) by way of pledge or assignment of a security interest subject to the restrictions of subsection (d) of this Section (and any other attempted assignment or transfer by any party hereto shall be null and void).  Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants to the extent provided in paragraph (d) of this Section and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

Minimum Amounts.




 




(A)

in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender’s Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it or in the case of an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund, no minimum amount need be assigned; and




 




(B)

in any case not described in subsection (b)(i)(A) of this Section, the aggregate amount of the Commitment (which for this purpose includes Loans outstanding thereunder) or, if the applicable Commitment is not then in effect, the principal outstanding balance of the Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if “Trade Date” is specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade Date) shall not be less than $5,000,000, unless each of the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower otherwise consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided that the Borrower shall be deemed to have given its consent five (5) Business Days after the date written notice thereof has been delivered by the assigning Lender (through the Administrative Agent) unless such consent is expressly refused by the Borrower prior to such fifth (5th) Business Day;




 

61




 
(ii)           Proportionate Amounts.  Each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Loans or the Commitment assigned;
 
(iii)          Required Consents.  No consent shall be required for any assignment except to the extent required by subsection (b)(i)(B) of this Section and, in addition:
 




(A)

the consent of the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld) shall be required unless (I) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of such assignment or (II) such assignment is to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund; provided that the Borrower shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment unless it shall object thereto by written notice to the Administrative Agent within five (5) Business Days after having received notice thereof; and




 




(B)

the consent of the Administrative Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required for assignments if such assignment is to a Person that is not a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund.




 
(iv)          Assignment and Assumption.  The parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500 for each assignment (provided that only one such fee will be payable in connection with simultaneous assignments to two or more Approved Funds by a Lender), and the assignee, if it is not a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire.
 
(v)          No Assignment to Certain Persons.  No such assignment shall be made to (A) the Borrower or any of the Borrower’s Affiliates or Subsidiaries or (B) to any Defaulting Lender or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Person who, upon becoming a Lender hereunder, would constitute any of the foregoing Persons described in this clause (B).
 
(vi)          No Assignment to Natural Persons.  No such assignment shall be made to a natural person.
 

62




 
(vii)         Certain Additional Payments.  In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments to the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with the consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Loans previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (A) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent and each other Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon), and (B) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro rata share of all Loans in accordance with its Commitment Percentage.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under applicable law without compliance with the provisions of this subsection, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs.
 
Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection (c) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.09, 2.11, 2.13, 2.14, 8.05 and 8.06 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment; provided that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no assignment by a Defaulting Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender’s having been a Defaulting Lender.  Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this paragraph shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with subsection (d) of this Section.
 
(c)          Register.  The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it (or the equivalent thereof in electronic form) and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of, and principal amounts (and stated interest) of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the “Register”).  The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement.  The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and any Lender (but only to the extent of entries in the Register that are applicable to such Lender), at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
 
(d)          Participations.  Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural person or the Borrower or any of the Borrower’s Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a “Participant”) in all or a portion of such Lender’s rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement.  For the avoidance of doubt, each Lender shall be responsible for the indemnity under Section 8.07(b) without regard to the existence of any participation.
 

63




 
Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver or modification described in Section 8.01 that directly affects such Participant and could not be effected by a vote of the Required Lenders.  The Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.09, 2.11 and 2.13 (subject to the requirements and limitations therein, including the requirements under Section 2.13(e) (it being understood that the documentation required under Section 2.13(e) shall be delivered to the participating Lender)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to Section 8.08(b); provided that such Participant (A) agrees to be subject to the provisions of Section 2.14(b) and Section 2.14(a) as if it were an assignee under Section 8.08(b); and (B) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.09 or 2.13, with respect to any participation, than its participating Lender would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation.  Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at the Borrower’s request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrower to effectuate the provisions of Section 2.14(b) and Section 2.14(a) with respect to any Participant.  To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 8.04(a) as though it were a Lender; provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 8.04(b) as though it were a Lender.  Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant’s interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the “Participant Register”); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant’s interest in any commitments, loans or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations.  The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive, absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.
 
(e)          Certain Pledges.  Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including without limitation any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.
 

64

Any provision of this Agreement which is prohibited, unenforceable or not authorized in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition, unenforceability or non-authorization without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof or affecting the validity, enforceability or legality of such provision in any other jurisdiction.

(d)          agrees that nothing herein shall affect the right to effect service of process in any other manner permitted by law or shall limit the right to sue in any other jurisdiction.

_____________________, 20__
 
For value received, South Jersey Gas Company, a New Jersey corporation (the “Borrower”), promises to pay to the order of _________________ (the “Lender”), for the account of its Applicable Lending Office, the principal amount of each Loan made from time to time by the Lender to the Borrower pursuant to the Credit Agreement referred to below, on the dates provided in the Credit Agreement.  The Borrower promises to pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of this Note on the dates and at the rate or rates provided for in the Credit Agreement.  Following the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, principal of and, to the extent permitted by law, overdue interest on the principal amount hereof shall bear interest at the Default Rate.  All payments of principal and interest under this Note shall be made in Dollars in immediately available funds to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Lender, as set forth in the Credit Agreement.
 
The date, amount, Type, interest rate and duration of each Interest Period (if applicable) of each Loan made by the Lender to the Borrower, and each payment made on account of the principal thereof, shall be recorded by the Lender on its books; provided that the failure of the Lender to make any such recordation or endorsement shall not affect the obligations of the Borrower to make a payment when due of any amount owing under this Note with respect to the Loans to be evidenced by this Note, and each such recordation or endorsement shall be conclusive and binding, absent manifest error.
 
This Note is one of the Notes referred to in the Term Loan Credit Agreement, dated as of January 26, 2017 (as the same may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified in accordance with its terms at any time and from time to time, the “Credit Agreement”), by and among the Borrower, the lenders party thereto (including the Lender) and PNC Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent.  Capitalized terms used and not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Credit Agreement.

The Borrower agrees, in the event that this Note or any portion hereof is collected by law or through an attorney at law, to pay all reasonable costs of collection, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees, to the extent expressly provided for in the Credit Agreement.
 
This Note shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the law of the State of New York.
