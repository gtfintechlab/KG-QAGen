 Maturity Date
  
Remaining unpaid principal amount of the Initial Loans.
 The remaining unpaid principal amount of the Initial Loans shall be due and payable in full, if not earlier in accordance with
this Agreement, on the Maturity Date applicable to the Initial 
  33 



Loans. The principal amount of Refinancing Loans of each Refinancing Lender shall be repaid by the Borrower as provided in the Refinancing Amendment, subject to the requirements of
Section 3.4 (which installments shall, to the extent applicable, be reduced as a result of the application of prepayments in accordance with the order of priority set forth in Section 4.8). To the extent not previously paid, each
Refinancing Loan shall be due and payable on the Maturity Date applicable to such Refinancing Loans.  SECTION 3. FEES; DEFAULTING
LENDERS; EXTENSIONS OF MATURITY  3.1 Fees. 
(a) Closing Fees. The Borrower agrees to pay closing fees to each Lender that is party to this Agreement as a Lender on the Closing
Date, as a yield enhancement fee for the funding of such Lenders Initial Loans, in an amount equal to 2.00% of the stated principal amount of such Lenders Initial Loans, payable to such Lender on the Closing Date out of the proceeds of
such Lenders Initial Loans as and when funded on the Closing Date. Such closing yield enhancement fee will be in all respects fully earned, due and payable on the Closing Date and shall not be refundable under any circumstances. 
(b) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own account, the administrative fees payable in the amounts and at the
times separately agreed upon among the Borrower and the Administrative Agent or any Affiliate thereof. All such fees shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent. Once paid, none of such fees shall be
refundable under any circumstances.  3.2 Defaulting Lenders. If the Borrower and the Administrative Agent agree in writing in their
discretion that a Lender that is a Defaulting Lender should no longer be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto; provided, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the
affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to a Lender that is not a Defaulting Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from such Lenders having been a Defaulting Lender. Any
payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of a Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Section 9 or otherwise), shall be applied at such time
or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by that Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder; second, if so determined by the Administrative
Agent and the Borrower, to be held in a non-interest bearing deposit account and released in order to satisfy obligations of that Defaulting Lender to fund Loans under this Agreement; third, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders
as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender, against that Defaulting Lender as a result of that Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement; fourth, so long as no Default
or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against that Defaulting Lender as a result of that Defaulting Lenders
breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and fifth, to that Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction. Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are
applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender pursuant to this Section 3.2 shall be deemed paid to and redirected by that Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto 
  34 


3.3 Extensions of Maturity. 
(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, pursuant to one or more offers (each, an Extension Offer)
made from time to time (provided such offers are made not less than 90 days prior to the Maturity Date of the applicable Loans), by the Borrower to all Lenders of Loans with a like maturity date on a pro rata basis (based on the aggregate
outstanding principal amount of the respective Loans with the same maturity date) and on the same terms to each such Lender, the Borrower may from time to time with the consent of any Lender that shall have accepted such offer (each such Lender, an
Extending Lender) extend the maturity date of any Loans of such Lender only and otherwise modify the terms of such Loans of such Lender only, pursuant to the terms of the relevant Extension Offer (including, without limitation, by
increasing or decreasing the interest rate or fees payable in respect of such Loans and/or modifying the amortization schedule in respect of such Loans) (each, an Extension, and each group of Loans as so extended, as well as the
original Loans not so extended, being an Extension Tranche; it being understood that any Extended Loans shall constitute a separate Tranche of Loans from the Tranche of Loans from which they were converted), so long as the
following terms are satisfied: (i) no Specified Event of Default shall exist at the time the notice in respect of an Extension Offer is delivered to the Lenders, and no Specified Event of Default shall exist immediately prior to or after giving
effect to the effectiveness of any Extended Loans, (ii) except as to interest rates, fees, amortization, final maturity date, premium, required prepayment dates and participation in prepayments (which shall, subject to the immediately
succeeding clauses (iii), (iv) and (v), be determined by the Borrower and set forth in the relevant Extension Offer), the Loans of any Extending Lender extended pursuant to any Extension (Extended Loans) shall have the same
terms as the Tranche of Loans subject to such Extension Offer (except for covenants or other provisions contained therein applicable only to periods after the then Latest Maturity Date of such non-extended Loans); provided, that if the
effective yield applicable to a given tranche of Extended Loans (which, for such purposes only, shall be deemed to take account any then applicable interest rate margin, interest rate benchmark floors, recurring fees and all upfront or
similar fees or original issue discount (amortized over the shorter of (x) the life of such loans and (y) four years) payable to all Extending Lenders providing such Extended Loans but exclusive of any arrangement, structuring or other
fees payable in connection therewith that are not shared with all Extending Lenders providing such Extended Loans) determined as of the initial extension date for such Extended Loans exceeds the effective yield of any Initial Loans or
any other tranche of Loans (unless the terms of such tranche provide that such tranche is not subject to this provision) (determined on the same basis as provided above, with the comparative determination to be made in the reasonable judgment of the
Administrative Agent consistent with generally accepted financial practice) by more than 0.50% (the amount of such excess over 0.50% being the Yield Differential), the Applicable Margin for such Initial Loans or such other tranche
of Loans subject to a Yield Differential shall automatically be increased by the Yield Differential effective upon the making or extension of the applicable Extended Loans, (iii) the final maturity date of any Extended Loans shall be no earlier
than the then Latest Maturity Date of any Loan under this Agreement at the time of extension and the amortization schedule applicable to Loans pursuant to Section 2.3 for periods prior to the Maturity Date of the Loans may not be increased with
respect to such Extended 
  35 



Loans, (iv) the weighted average life to maturity of any Extended Loans shall be no shorter than the remaining weighted average life to maturity of the Loans extended thereby, (v) any
Extended Loans may participate on a pro rata basis or on a less than pro rata basis (but not on a greater than pro rata basis) in any voluntary or mandatory prepayments hereunder, as specified in the applicable Extension Offer, (vi) if the
aggregate principal amount of Loans in respect of which Lenders shall have accepted the relevant Extension Offer shall exceed the maximum aggregate principal amount of Loans offered to be extended by the Borrower pursuant to such Extension Offer,
then the Loans of such Lenders shall be extended ratably up to such maximum amount based on the respective principal amounts with respect to which such Lenders have accepted such Extension Offer, (vii) all documentation in respect of such
Extension shall be consistent with the foregoing, (viii) to the extent reasonably necessary to maintain the continuing priority of the Lien of the Mortgages as security for the Obligations, as determined by the Administrative Agent in its
reasonable discretion: (1) the applicable Loan Party to any Mortgages shall have entered into, and delivered to the Collateral Agent, at the direction and in the sole discretion of the Administrative Agent a mortgage modification or new
Mortgage in proper form for recording in the relevant jurisdiction and in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, and (2) the Borrower shall have caused to be delivered to the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Secured
Parties an endorsement to the title insurance policy, date down(s) or other evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent insuring that the priority of the Lien of the Mortgages as security for the Obligations has not changed and
confirming and/or insuring that since the issuance of the title insurance policy there has been no change in the condition of title and there are no intervening liens or encumbrances which may then or thereafter take priority over the Lien of the
Mortgages, (ix) any Extension Offer is required to be in a minimum amount of at least $10,000,000 and (x) in connection with such Extension, the Administrative Agent shall have received legal opinions, board resolutions, secretarys
certificates and other customary closing documents reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Lender shall be obligated to consent to any Extension Offer. 
(b) Extensions consummated by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 3.3 shall not constitute voluntary or mandatory payments or
prepayments for purposes of Section 4.1 or Section 4.2.  (c) The Lenders hereby irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent
and the Collateral Agent to enter into amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents with the Borrower as may be necessary in order to establish new Extension Tranches or sub-Extension Tranches in respect of Extended Loans and such
technical amendments as may be necessary or appropriate in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower in connection with the establishment of such new Extension Tranches or sub-Extension Tranches, in each case on terms
consistent with this Section 3.3.  (d) In connection with any Extension, the Borrower shall provide the Administrative Agent at least
five Business Days (or such shorter period as may be agreed by the Administrative Agent) prior written notice thereof, and shall agree to such procedures, if any, as may be established by, or acceptable to, the Administrative Agent, in
each case acting reasonably, to accomplish the purposes of this Section 3.3. 
  36 


(e) This Section 3.3 shall supersede any provisions in Section 4.8(b) or 11.1 to the
contrary.  (f) If, in connection with any proposed Extension, any Lender declines to consent to the applicable extension on the terms and
by the deadline set forth in the applicable Extension Offer (each such Lender, a Non-Extending Lender) then the Borrower may, on notice to the Administrative Agent and the Non-Extending Lender, replace such Non-Extending Lender by
causing such Lender to (and such Lender shall be obligated to) assign pursuant to Section 11.6 (with the assignment fee and any other costs and expenses to be paid by the Borrower in such instance) all of its rights and obligations under this
Agreement to one or more assignees; provided that neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall have any obligation to the Borrower to find a replacement Lender; provided, further, that the applicable assignee shall have
agreed to provide Extended Loans on the terms set forth in such Extension; and provided, further, that all obligations of the Borrower owing to the Non-Extending Lender relating to the Loans so assigned shall be paid in full by the
assignee Lender to such Non-Extending Lender concurrently with such Assignment and Assumption and the Borrower shall pay to such Non-Extending Lender any premium required to be paid by Section 4.1(b). Each Lender hereby grants to the
Administrative Agent an irrevocable power of attorney (which power is coupled with an interest) to execute and deliver, on behalf of such Lender, as assignor, any Assignment and Assumption necessary to effectuate any assignment of such Lenders
interests hereunder in the circumstances contemplated by this Section 3.3(f).  Following any Extension, with the written consent of
the Borrower, any Non-Extending Lender may elect to have all or a portion of its Loans not so extended deemed to be an Extended Loan under the applicable Extension Tranche on any date (each date a Designation Date) prior to the
maturity date of such Extension Tranche; provided that (i) such Lender shall have provided written notice to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at least 10 Business Days prior to such Designation Date (or such shorter period
as the Administrative Agent may agree in its reasonable discretion) and (ii) no more than three Designation Dates may occur in any one year period without the written consent of the Administrative Agent. Following a Designation Date, the Loans
held by such Lender so elected to be extended will be deemed to be Extended Loans of the applicable Extension Tranche, and any existing Loans held by such Lender not elected to be extended, if any, shall continue to be Loans of the applicable
Extension Tranche.  3.4 Refinancing Facilities. 
(a) The Borrower may, at any time or from time to time after the Closing Date, upon written notice to Administrative Agent (a
Refinancing Loan Request), request the establishment of one or more new Classes of term loans under this Agreement (any such new Class, Refinancing Commitments) established in exchange for, or to replace,
repurchase, retire or refinance, in whole or in part, as selected by the Borrower, any one or more then-existing Class or Classes of Loans or Commitments (with respect to a particular Refinancing Commitment or Refinancing Loan, such existing Loans
or Commitments, Refinanced Debt), whereupon Administrative Agent shall promptly deliver a copy of each such notice to each of the Lenders. 
  37 


(b) Any Refinancing Loans made pursuant to Refinancing Commitments made on a Refinancing Tranche
Closing Date shall be designated a separate Class of Refinancing Loans for all purposes of this Agreement. On any Refinancing Tranche Closing Date on which any Refinancing Commitments of any Class are effected, subject to the satisfaction of the
terms and conditions in this Section 3.4, (i) each Refinancing Lender of such Class shall make a Loan to the Borrower (a Refinancing Loan) in an amount equal to its Refinancing Commitment of such Class and (ii) each
Refinancing Lender of such Class shall become a Lender hereunder with respect to the Refinancing Commitment of such Class and the Refinancing Loans of such Class made pursuant thereto. 
(c) Each Refinancing Loan Request from the Borrower pursuant to this Section 3.4 shall set forth the requested amount and proposed terms
of the relevant Refinancing Loans and identify the Refinanced Debt with respect thereto. Refinancing Loans may be made by any existing Lender (but no existing Lender will have an obligation to make any Refinancing Commitment, nor will the Borrower
have any obligation to approach any existing Lender to provide any Refinancing Commitment) or by any other lender (each such existing Lender or other lender providing such Commitment or Loan, a Refinancing Lender and,
collectively, Refinancing Lenders); provided that (i) the Administrative Agent shall have consented (not to be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed) to such existing Lenders or lenders making such
Refinancing Loans to the extent such consent, if any, would be required under Section 11.6 for an assignment of Loans to such other lender and (ii) any Affiliate of a Lender providing a Refinancing Commitment shall be subject to the same
restrictions set forth in Section 11.6 as they would otherwise be subject to with respect to any purchase by or assignment to such Affiliate of a Lender of Loans. 
(d) The effectiveness of any Refinancing Amendment, and the Refinancing Commitments thereunder, shall be subject to the satisfaction on the
date thereof (a Refinancing Tranche Closing Date) of each of the following conditions, together with any other conditions set forth in the Refinancing Amendment: 
(i) after giving effect to such Refinancing Commitments, the conditions of Sections 6.1(m) and (o) shall be satisfied (it
being understood that all references to the date of such extension of credit or similar language in such Section 6 shall be deemed to refer to the applicable Refinancing Tranche Closing Date), 
(ii) each Refinancing Commitment shall be in an aggregate principal amount that is not less than $5,000,000 and shall be in an
increment of 1,000,000, (provided that such amount may be less than $5,000,000, and not in an increment of $1,000,000, if such amount is equal to the entire outstanding principal amount of Refinanced Debt), and 
(iii) to the extent reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent, receipt by the Administrative Agent of legal opinions,
good standing certificates, board resolutions, officers certificates and/or reaffirmation agreements consistent in all material respects with those delivered on the Closing Date under Section 6 (other than changes to such legal opinions
resulting from a change in law, change in fact or change to counsels form of opinion reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent), including any supplements or amendments to the Security Documents providing for such Refinancing
Commitments and Refinancing Loans to be secured thereby by the Collateral of the Loan Parties. 
  38 


(e) The terms, provisions and documentation of the Refinancing Loans and Refinancing Commitments
of any Class shall be as agreed between the Borrower and the applicable Refinancing Lenders providing such Refinancing Commitments, and except as otherwise set forth herein, to the extent not identical to any Class of Loans existing on the
Refinancing Tranche Closing Date, shall be consistent with clauses (i) or (ii) below, as applicable, and otherwise shall be (taken as a whole) substantially identical to, or not materially more favorable (as reasonably determined by
Borrower in good faith and conclusively evidenced by a certificate of the Borrower) to the Refinancing Lenders than those applicable to such Class (taken as a whole) being refinanced (except for covenants or other provisions applicable only to
periods after the Maturity Date (as of the applicable Refinancing Tranche Closing Date) of such Class being refinanced, and pricing, optional prepayment, or redemption terms); provided, that if the effective yield applicable to a
given tranche of Refinancing Loans (which, for such purposes only, shall be deemed to take account any then applicable interest rate margin, interest rate benchmark floors, recurring fees and all upfront or similar fees or original issue discount
(amortized over the shorter of (x) the life of such loans and (y) four years) payable to all Refinancing Lenders providing such Refinancing Loans but exclusive of any arrangement, structuring or other fees payable in connection therewith
that are not shared with all Refinancing Lenders providing such Refinancing Loans) determined as of the initial funding date for such Refinancing Loans exceeds the effective yield of any Initial Loans or any other tranche of Loans
(unless the terms of such tranche provide that such tranche is not subject to this provision) (determined on the same basis as provided above, with the comparative determination to be made in the reasonable judgment of the Administrative Agent
consistent with generally accepted financial practice) by more than the Yield Differential, the Applicable Margin for such Initial Loans or such other tranche of Loans subject to a Yield Differential shall automatically be increased by the Yield
Differential effective upon the making of the applicable Refinancing Loans. In any event, the Refinancing Loans:  (i) as of
the Refinancing Tranche Closing Date, shall not have a final scheduled maturity date earlier than the Maturity Date of the Refinanced Debt, 
(ii) shall have a weighted average life to maturity not shorter than the remaining weighted average life to maturity of the
Refinanced Debt on the date of incurrence of such Refinancing Loans (except by virtue of amortization or prepayment of the Refinanced Debt prior to the time of such incurrence), 
(iii) shall not be subject to any guaranty by any person other than a Loan Party and shall not include any borrower other than
a borrower hereunder,  (iv) shall provide that the permanent repayment of Loans with respect to, and termination or
reduction of, Refinancing Commitments after the associated Refinancing Tranche Closing Date shall be made on a pro rata basis, or on a less than (but not greater than, except that Refinancing Commitments may participate on a greater than pro rata
basis in any permanent prepayments and termination with other Commitments, other than the Commitments in effect on the Closing Date) pro rata basis, with all other 
  39 



Commitments, except that the Borrower shall be permitted to permanently repay and terminate Commitments in respect of any such Class of Loans on a greater than pro rata basis as compared to any
other Class of Loans with a later Maturity Date than such Class or in connection with any refinancing thereof permitted by this Agreement, 
(v) shall not have a greater principal amount than the principal amount of the Refinanced Debt plus any accrued but unpaid
interest and fees on such Refinanced Debt plus the amount of any tender premium or penalty or premium required to be paid under the terms of the instrument or documents governing such Refinanced Debt and any defeasance costs and any reasonable fees
and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) incurred in connection with the issuance of such Refinancing Loans, and 
(vi)(I) shall rank pari passu in right of payment with the Obligations under the then existing Loans and (II) shall either be
(x) secured by the Collateral (and shall not be secured by any assets of the Borrower or any Subsidiary not constituting Collateral) and shall rank pari passu or junior in right of security with the Obligations or (y) unsecured, and if
secured, shall be subject to an Intercreditor Agreement.  (f) Commitments in respect of Refinancing Loans shall become additional
Commitments under this Agreement pursuant to an amendment (a Refinancing Amendment) to this Agreement and, as appropriate, the other Loan Documents, executed by the Borrower, each Refinancing Lender providing such Commitments and
the Administrative Agent. The Refinancing Amendment may, without the consent of any other Loan Party, Agent or Lender, effect such amendments (which may be executed and delivered solely by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent) to this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents with the Borrower as may be deemed necessary or appropriate by Administrative Agent to effect the provisions of this Section 3.4, including, if applicable, amendments necessary or appropriate to effect any lien
subordination and associated rights of the applicable Lenders to the extent any Refinancing Loans are to rank junior in right of security. The Borrower will use the proceeds, if any, of the Refinancing Loans in exchange for, or to extend, renew,
replace, repurchase, retire or refinance, and shall permanently terminate applicable commitments under, substantially concurrently, the applicable Refinanced Debt. 
(g) The Borrower may, upon written notice to the Administrative Agent, at any time or from time to time after the Closing Date issue, incur or
otherwise obtain (A) secured Indebtedness in the form of one or more series of senior secured notes or loans that are secured on a pari passu basis with the Obligations (but without regard to the control of remedies) (such notes or
loans, Permitted Pari Passu Secured Refinancing Debt), (B) secured Indebtedness in the form of one or more series of second lien (or other junior lien) secured notes or loans (such notes or loans, Permitted Junior
Secured Refinancing Debt) and (C) unsecured Indebtedness in the form of one or more series of unsecured notes or loans (such notes or loans, Permitted Unsecured Refinancing Debt and together with Permitted Pari
Passu Secured Refinancing Debt and Permitted Junior Secured Refinancing Debt, Refinancing Equivalent Debt), in each case, in exchange for, or to extend, renew, replace, repurchase, retire or refinance, in whole or in part,
any existing Loans (Refinanced Loans). Any Refinancing Equivalent Debt: 
  40 


(i)(1) shall not have a final scheduled maturity date earlier than the Maturity
Date of the Refinanced Loans, (2) shall not have a weighted average life to maturity shorter than the remaining weighted average life to maturity of the Refinanced Loans (except by virtue of amortization or prepayment of the Refinanced Loans
prior to the time of such incurrence), (3) shall not have scheduled amortization or payments of principal and not be subject to mandatory redemption, repurchase or prepayment (except with respect to change of control, asset sale, insurance and
casualty and condemnation event mandatory offers to purchase or prepayment events and events of default), in each case prior to the Maturity Date of the Refinanced Loans, (4) shall not be guaranteed by persons other than Guarantors and shall
not include any borrower or issuer other than the Borrower hereunder, (5) if in the form of subordinated Permitted Unsecured Refinancing Debt, shall be subject to a subordination agreement or provisions as reasonably agreed by
Administrative Agent, and (6) shall not have a greater principal amount than the principal amount of the Refinanced Loans plus any accrued but unpaid interest and fees on such Refinanced Loans plus the amount of any tender premium or penalty or
premium required to be paid under the terms of the instrument or documents governing such Refinanced Loans and any defeasance costs and any reasonable fees and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) incurred in
connection with the issuance of such Refinancing Equivalent Debt Loans, and (7) except as otherwise set forth in this clause, shall have terms and conditions (other than with respect to pricing, optional prepayment or redemption terms) which
are (taken as a whole) substantially identical to, or not materially more favorable (as reasonably determined by the Borrower in good faith and conclusively evidenced by a certificate of the Borrower) to the lenders or holders providing such
Refinancing Equivalent Debt, than those applicable to the Refinanced Loans (except for covenants or other provisions applicable only to periods after the Maturity Date of the applicable Refinanced Loans at the time of the issuance or incurrence of
such Refinancing Equivalent Debt);  (ii)(1) if either Permitted Pari Passu Secured Refinancing Debt or Permitted Junior
Secured Refinancing Debt, shall be subject to security agreements relating to such Refinancing Equivalent Debt that are substantially the same as or more favorable to the Loan Parties than the Security Documents (with such differences as are
reasonably satisfactory to Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent), (2) if Permitted Pari Passu Secured Refinancing Debt, (x) shall be secured by the Collateral on a pari passu basis with the Obligations and shall not be secured by any
property or assets of either Borrower or any of their Subsidiaries other than the Collateral, and (y) shall be subject to an Intercreditor Agreement, and (3) if Permitted Junior Secured Refinancing Debt, (x) shall be secured by the
Collateral on a second priority (or other junior priority) basis to the Liens securing the Obligations and shall not be secured by any property or assets of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries other than the Collateral, and (y) shall be
subject to an Intercreditor Agreement, and  (iii) shall be incurred, and the proceeds thereof used, solely to repay,
repurchase, retire or refinance substantially concurrently the Refinanced Loans and terminate all commitments thereunder. 
  41 


SECTION 4. GENERAL PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO LOANS 
4.1 Optional Prepayments. (a) The Borrower may at any time after the first anniversary of the Closing Date, and from time to time
thereafter prepay the Loans, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty (subject to Section 4.1(b)), upon irrevocable (provided that any such notice delivered by the Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness
of any one or more events, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied) notice delivered to the Administrative Agent
no later than 11:00 A.M., New York City time, three Business Days prior thereto, in the case of LIBOR Loans, and no later than 11:00 A.M., New York City time, one Business Day prior thereto, in the case of Base Rate Loans, which notice shall specify
the date and amount of prepayment and whether the prepayment is of LIBOR Loans or Base Rate Loans; provided, that if a LIBOR Loan is prepaid on any day other than the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, the Borrower shall also
pay any amounts owing pursuant to Section 4.11. Upon receipt of any such notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each relevant Lender thereof. Unless the notice shall be properly revoked pursuant to the first sentence of this
Section 4.1(a), the amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein, together with accrued interest to such date on the amount prepaid. Partial prepayments of Loans pursuant to this Section 4.1 shall
be in an aggregate principal amount of $1,000,000 or integral multiples of $100,000 in excess thereof. Subject to Section 4.8(b), the amount of each principal prepayment of the Loans pursuant to this Section 4.1 shall be applied
(x) on a pro rata basis as between each Class of Loans and (y) to reduce the then remaining installments of Loans of the same Class on a pro rata basis, as directed by the Borrower. 
(b) All mandatory repayments of principal of Loans required pursuant to Section 4.2(b) or required upon the Loans becoming due and
payable in accordance with Section 9.1, in each case, prior to the first anniversary of the Closing Date, will be subject to payment by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent, for the ratable account of each Lender, of the Prepayment Premium
on the principal amount so prepaid or repaid. All voluntary prepayments of principal of Loans pursuant to Section 4.1 (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any prepayment of Refinanced Debt) and all mandatory repayments of principal of Loans
required pursuant to Section 4.2(b) or required upon the Loans becoming due and payable in accordance with Section 9.1, in each case, on or after the first anniversary of the Closing Date but prior to the second anniversary of the Closing
Date, will be subject to payment by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent, for the ratable account of each Lender, of a prepayment premium on the principal amount so prepaid or repaid of 2.0%; provided, that, for the avoidance of doubt,
the Borrower not may not make any voluntary prepayments of principal of Loans prior to the first anniversary of the Closing Date. Such fees shall be due and payable upon the date of any voluntary prepayment or any mandatory prepayment of principal
of Loans required pursuant to Section 4.2(b) or required upon the Loans becoming due and payable in accordance with Section 9.1. 
4.2 Mandatory Prepayments. (a) If, for any fiscal year of the Borrower commencing with the fiscal year ending June 24, 2016,
there shall be Excess Cash Flow for such fiscal year, the Borrower shall, on the relevant Excess Cash Flow Application Date, apply an amount equal to (i) the ECF Percentage of such Excess Cash Flow minus (ii) the aggregate amount of
all 
  42 



optional prepayments of the Loans during such fiscal year, toward the prepayment of the Loans as set forth in Section 4.2(d). Each such prepayment shall be made on a date (an Excess
Cash Flow Application Date) no later than five days after the earlier of (i) the date on which the financial statements referred to in Section 7.1(a), for the fiscal year with respect to which such prepayment is made, are
required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent and (ii) the date such financial statements are actually delivered to the Administrative Agent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all prepayments required pursuant
to this clause (a) attributable to Subsidiaries of the Borrower are subject to permissibility under local law (e.g., financial assistance, corporate benefit, restrictions on up-streaming of cash intra-group and the fiduciary and statutory
duties of the directors of the relevant subsidiaries) and shall not be required to be paid until such time as such Subsidiary may upstream or transfer such amount to the Borrower (it being understood that such restriction shall not apply to any
Subsidiary organized under the laws of any state of the United States or the District of Columbia). Further, if the Borrower and its Subsidiaries would incur a tax liability if all or a portion of the funds required to make a mandatory prepayment
under this clause (a) were upstreamed or transferred as a distribution or dividend by a foreign Subsidiary to the Borrower (a Restricted Amount), the amount the Borrower will be required to mandatorily prepay shall be reduced
by the Restricted Amount until such time as it may upstream or transfer such Restricted Amount without incurring such tax liability.  (b)
If any Indebtedness (other than Excluded Indebtedness) shall be issued or incurred by any of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, the Borrower shall apply, on the date of such issuance or incurrence, an amount equal to 100% of the Net Cash
Proceeds thereof toward the prepayment of the Loans as set forth in Section 4.2(d).  (c) If the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries
shall receive Net Cash Proceeds (or Net Cash Proceeds shall be received on behalf of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries) (including cash proceeds subsequently received (as and when received) in respect of noncash consideration initially
received) in excess of $5,000,000 in the aggregate during the term of this Agreement from any Asset Sale, or from any Recovery Event then, unless a Reinvestment Notice shall be delivered within 10 days in respect thereof, the Borrower shall promptly
(but in no event later than the next Business Day) after such 10th day deliver to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to such Net Cash Proceeds toward the prepayment of the Loans as set forth
in Section 4.2(d); provided, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, on each Reinvestment Prepayment Date, the Borrower shall apply an amount equal to the Reinvestment Prepayment Amount with respect to the relevant Reinvestment Event toward
the prepayment of the Loans as set forth in Section 4.2(d); provided, however, that notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Net Cash Proceeds received from a Disposition of any Capital Stock of MineSet (other
than a Disposition of 100% of the Capital Stock of MineSet) must be used by the Borrower to acquire or repair assets to be used or used directly in MineSets business. 
(d) Subject to Section 4.8(b), amounts to be applied in connection with prepayments made pursuant to this Section 4.2 shall be
applied (x) on a pro rata basis as between each Class of Loans and (y) to reduce on a pro rata basis the remaining scheduled installments of principal (including the final scheduled installment on the Maturity Date of the Loans (or such
later maturity date of any Loans extended in accordance with Section 3.3)) due in respect of each Class of Loans. The application of any prepayment pursuant to Section 4.2 shall be made, first,

  43 



to Base Rate Loans and, second, to LIBOR Loans. Each prepayment of the Loans pursuant to Section 4.2 shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the date of such prepayment on the
amount prepaid. If a LIBOR Loan is prepaid pursuant to Section 4.2 on any day other than the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, the Borrower shall also pay any amounts owing pursuant to Section 4.11. 
(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any Lender may elect, by notice to the Administrative Agent at or prior to the time and in
the manner specified by the Administrative Agent, prior to the date that is three Business Days following the date any prepayment of Loans is made by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 4.2, to decline all of any prepayment of its Loans
pursuant to clauses (a) or (c) of this Section 4.2, in which case the aggregate amount of the prepayment that would have been applied to prepay such Loans but was so declined shall be re-offered to those Lenders who have initially
accepted such prepayment (such re-offer to be made (x) on a pro rata basis across each Class of Loans, (y) to each such Lender of a particular Class based on the percentage which such Lenders Loans of that Class represents of the
aggregate Loans of all such Lenders of that Class who have initially accepted such prepayment and (z) within three Business Days of the date such prepayment was declined). In the event of such a re-offer, the relevant Lenders may elect, by
notice to the Administrative Agent at or prior to the time and in the manner specified by the Administrative Agent, to decline all of the amount of such prepayment that is re-offered to them, in which case the aggregate amount of the prepayment that
would have been applied to prepay such Loans pursuant to such re-offer but was so declined (any such amount, a Retained Amount) shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower to be used for any other purpose
permitted by this Agreement.  (f) The Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent, at the time of each prepayment required under
this Section 4.2, a certificate signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower setting forth in reasonable detail the calculation of the amount of such prepayment. 
4.3 Conversion and Continuation Options. (a) The Borrower may elect from time to time to convert LIBOR Loans to Base Rate Loans by
giving the Administrative Agent prior irrevocable notice of such election no later than 1:00 P.M., New York City time, on the Business Day preceding the proposed conversion date; provided that any such conversion of LIBOR Loans may only be
made on the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto. The Borrower may elect from time to time to convert Base Rate Loans to LIBOR Loans by giving the Administrative Agent prior irrevocable notice of such election no later than 1:00 P.M.,
New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding the proposed conversion date (which notice shall specify the length of the initial Interest Period therefor); provided that no Base Rate Loan may be converted into a LIBOR Loan when any
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent has or the Required Lenders have determined in its or their sole discretion not to permit such conversions. Upon receipt of any such notice the Administrative Agent shall
promptly notify each Lender thereof.  (b) Any LIBOR Loan may be continued as such upon the expiration of the then current Interest Period
with respect thereto by the Borrower giving irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent, in accordance with the applicable provisions of the term Interest Period set forth in Section 1.1, of the length of the next Interest
Period to be applicable to such Loans; 
  44 



provided that no LIBOR Loan may be continued as such when any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent has or the Required Lenders have determined in
its or their sole discretion not to permit such continuations; and provided, further, that if the Borrower shall fail to give any required notice as described above in this paragraph or if such continuation is not permitted pursuant to
the preceding proviso such Loans shall be automatically converted to Base Rate Loans on the last day of such then expiring Interest Period. Upon receipt of any such notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender thereof. 
(c) The conversions and continuations of Loans pursuant to this Section 4.3 shall be in such amounts and be made pursuant to such
elections so that, after giving effect thereto, the aggregate principal amount of (i) a borrowing of Base Rate Loans shall be in an amount equal to $1,000,000 or integral multiples of $100,000 in excess thereof (or equal to the remaining
principal balance of the Loans) and (ii) the LIBOR Loans comprising each LIBOR Tranche shall be in an amount equal to $1,000,000 or integral multiples of $100,000 in excess thereof. 
4.4 Limitations on LIBOR Tranches. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all borrowings, conversions and
continuations of LIBOR Loans hereunder and all selections of Interest Periods hereunder shall be in such amounts and be made pursuant to such elections so that no more than ten LIBOR Tranches shall be outstanding at any one time. 
4.5 Interest Rates and Payment Dates. (a) Each LIBOR Loan shall bear interest for each day during each Interest Period with
respect thereto at a rate per annum equal to the LIBO Rate determined for such day plus the Applicable Margin.  (b) Each Base Rate Loan
shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin.  (c) Upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of a Specified Event of Default or, at the request of the Required Lenders, any other Event of Default, all outstanding and overdue Loans and other overdue amounts payable hereunder shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to
(i) in the case of the Loans, the rate that would otherwise be applicable thereto pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section plus 2%, and (ii) in the case of any such other amounts, the rate then applicable to Base Rate
Loans plus 2%, in each case from the date such Event of Default occurred until such Event of Default is no longer continuing.  (d)
Interest shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date; provided that interest accruing pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section shall be payable from time to time on demand. 
4.6 Computation of Interest and Fees. (a) Interest and fees payable pursuant hereto shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day
year for the actual days elapsed, except that, with respect to Base Rate Loans the rate of interest on which is calculated on the basis of clause (a) of the definition of Base Rate, the interest thereon shall be calculated on the basis of a
365- (or 366-, as the case may be) day year for the actual days elapsed. The Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the Borrower and the Lenders of each determination of a LIBO Rate. Any change in the interest rate on a Loan
resulting from a change in the Base Rate or the Eurocurrency Reserve Requirements shall become effective as of the opening of business on the 
  45 



day on which such change becomes effective. The Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the effective date and the amount of each such change in
interest rate.  (b) Each determination of an interest rate by the Administrative Agent pursuant to any provision of this Agreement shall be
conclusive and binding on the Borrower and the Lenders in the absence of manifest error. The Administrative Agent shall, at the request of the Borrower, deliver to the Borrower a statement showing the quotations used by the Administrative Agent in
determining any interest rate pursuant to Section 4.6(a).  4.7 Inability to Determine Interest Rate. If prior to the first day
of any Interest Period: (a) the Administrative Agent shall have determined that, by reason of circumstances affecting the relevant market, adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the LIBO Rate for such Interest Period, or
(b) the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Required Lenders that the LIBO Rate determined or to be determined for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (as conclusively
certified by such Lenders in good faith) of making or maintaining their affected Loans during such Interest Period, the Administrative Agent shall give telecopy or telephonic notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders as soon as practicable
thereafter. If such notice is given (w) in the event of a determination described in the preceding sentence with respect to the LIBO Rate component of the Base Rate, the utilization of the LIBOR Rate component in determining the Base Rate shall
be suspended, (x) any LIBOR Loans requested to be made on the first day of such Interest Period shall be made as Base Rate Loans, (y) any Loans that were to have been converted on the first day of such Interest Period to LIBOR Loans shall
be continued as Base Rate Loans and (z) any outstanding LIBOR Loans shall be converted, on the last day of the then-current Interest Period, to Base Rate Loans, in each case until the Administrative Agent revokes such notice. Until such notice
has been withdrawn by the Administrative Agent, no further LIBOR Loans shall be made or continued as such, nor shall the Borrower have the right to convert Loans to LIBOR Loans. 
4.8 Pro Rata Treatment; Application of Payments; Payments. (a) Each borrowing by the Borrower from the Lenders hereunder and any
reduction of the Commitments of the Lenders shall be made on a pro rata basis.  (b) Each payment (including each prepayment) by the
Borrower (other than payments made under Section 4.9 or 4.10) on account of principal of, and interest and fees on, a Class of Loans shall be made pro rata according to the respective outstanding principal amounts of the Loans of such Class
then held by the Lenders of such Class. Optional prepayments and, subject to Section 4.2(e), mandatory prepayments shall be applied ratably among Classes of Loans. Amounts repaid or prepaid on account of the Loans may not be reborrowed. 
(c) All payments (including prepayments) to be made by the Borrower hereunder, whether on account of principal, interest, fees or otherwise,
shall be made without setoff or counterclaim and shall be made prior to 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on the due date thereof to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Lenders, at the Funding Office, in Dollars and in immediately
available funds. The Administrative Agent shall distribute such payments to the Lenders promptly upon receipt in like funds as received. If any payment hereunder (other than payments on the LIBOR Loans) becomes due and payable on a day other than a
Business Day, 
  46 



such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day. If any payment on a LIBOR Loan becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, the maturity thereof shall be
extended to the next succeeding Business Day unless the result of such extension would be to extend such payment into another calendar month, in which event such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day. In the case of any
extension of any payment of principal pursuant to the preceding two sentences, interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such extension. 
(d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by any Lender prior to a borrowing that such Lender will not make the
amount that would constitute its share of such borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender is making such amount available to the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent may (but
shall not be required to), in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. If such amount is not made available to the Administrative Agent by the required time on the applicable date of borrowing, such
Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent, on demand, such amount with interest thereon at a rate equal to the greater of (i) the Federal Funds Effective Rate and (ii) a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with
banking industry rules on interbank compensation for the period until such Lender makes such amount immediately available to the Administrative Agent. A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to any amounts
owing under this paragraph shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. If such Lenders share of such borrowing is not made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender within three Business Days of such date of borrowing, the
Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum applicable to Base Rate Loans, on demand, from the Borrower. 
(e) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by the Borrower prior to the date of any payment due to be made by the
Borrower hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower is making such payment, and the Administrative Agent may, but shall not be required to, in reliance
upon such assumption, make available to the applicable Lenders their respective pro rata shares of a corresponding amount. If such payment is not made to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower within three Business Days after such due date,
the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover, on demand, from each Lender to which any amount was made available pursuant to the preceding sentence, such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum equal to the daily average Federal
Funds Effective Rate. Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender against the Borrower. 
4.9 Requirements of Law. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any Change in Law: 
(i) shall subject any Lender to any Tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to this Agreement or any Loan made by it, or change
the basis of taxation of payments to such Lender in respect thereof (except for (A) Non-Excluded Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes);

  47 


(ii) shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve, special deposit,
compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets held by, deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, advances, loans or other extensions of credit by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any office of such Lender that is not
otherwise included in the determination of the LIBO Rate hereunder; or  (iii) shall impose on such Lender any other
condition;  and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender, by an amount that such Lender in good faith deems to be
material, of making, converting into, continuing or maintaining LIBOR Loans, or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder, then, in any such case, the Borrower shall promptly pay such Lender, upon its demand, any additional amounts necessary to
compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduced amount receivable. If any Lender becomes entitled to claim any additional amounts pursuant to this paragraph, it shall promptly notify the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent)
of the event by reason of which it has become so entitled.  (b) If any Lender shall have determined that any Change in Law regarding
capital adequacy shall have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lenders capital or on the capital of any Person controlling such Lender as a consequence of its obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Lender or such
Person could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lenders or such Persons policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Lender in good faith to be material, then from time to
time, after submission by such Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of a written request therefor accompanied by a certificate showing calculation thereof in reasonable detail, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Person for such reduction.  (c) A certificate as to any additional
amounts payable (with reasonably detailed backup calculations) pursuant to this Section submitted by any Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Section, the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any amounts incurred more than six months prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of such Lenders
intention to claim compensation therefor; provided that, if the circumstances giving rise to such claim have a retroactive effect, then such six-month period shall be extended to include the period of such retroactive effect. The obligations
of the Borrower pursuant to this Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder. The protection of this Section 4.9 shall be available to each Lender regardless of
any possible contention of the invalidity or inapplicability of the Change in Law that shall have occurred or been imposed.  4.10
Taxes. (a) Except as required by any Requirement of Law, any and all payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower or any other Loan Party under this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of, and without
deduction or withholding for or on account of, any Taxes. If any Requirement of Law requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment, then (x) the Borrower or such other Loan Party, as the case may be, 
  48 



shall make such deductions or withholdings and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with such Requirement of Law, and
(y) if such Tax is a Non-Excluded Tax, the amounts so payable to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, as the case may be, shall be increased so that after making all such required deductions or withholdings (including deductions and
withholdings attributable to additional amounts payable under this Section), the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions or withholdings been made.
 (b) In addition, the Borrower and each other Loan Party, as the case may be, shall timely pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental
Authority in accordance with any Requirement of Law.  (c) Whenever any Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes are paid by the Borrower or any
other Loan Party to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section 4.10, as promptly as practicable thereafter the relevant Loan Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent for its own account or for the account of the relevant Lender,
as the case may be, a certified copy of an original official receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment, or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent.  (d) The Loan Parties shall jointly and severally indemnify the Administrative Agent or any Lender, as the case may
be, within 10 days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Non-Excluded Taxes (including Non-Excluded Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) payable or paid by the Administrative Agent or such
Lender, as applicable, or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as applicable, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Non-Excluded Taxes
were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the
Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  (e)(i) Any Lender that is
entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the
Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition,
any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or
the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and
submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 4.10(e)(ii)(A), (ii)(B), (ii)(C) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lenders reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission
would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. 
  49 


(ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that the Borrower is a U.S.
Person,  (A) any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the
date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed copies of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from
U.S. federal backup withholding Tax;  (B) any Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Non-U.S. Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable
request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:  (1) in the case of a
Non-U.S. Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN-E or W-8BEN, as applicable, establishing an
exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the interest article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN-E or W-8BEN, as
applicable, establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the business profits or other income article of such tax treaty; 
(2) executed copies of IRS Form W-8ECI; 
(3) in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c)
of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit D-1 to the effect that such Non-U.S. Lender is not a bank within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a 10 percent shareholder of the
Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a controlled foreign corporation described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate) and (y) executed
copies of IRS Form W-8BEN-E or W-8BEN, as applicable; or  (4) to the extent a Non-U.S. Lender is not the beneficial owner,
executed copies of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN-E, IRS Form W-8BEN, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit D-2 or Exhibit 
  50 



D-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Non-U.S. Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect
partners of such Non-U.S. Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Non-U.S. Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit D-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner; 
(C) any Non-U.S. Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative
Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Non-U.S. Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the
Administrative Agent), executed copies of any other form prescribed by Requirement of Law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be
prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and 
(D) if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if
such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent
at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code)
and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has
complied with such Lenders obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (D), FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this
Agreement.  Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any
respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so. 
(f) If the Administrative Agent or any Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has
been indemnified by the Borrower, or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts, pursuant to this Section 4.10, it shall pay the amount of such refund to the Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or
additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section 4.10 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as applicable, and without
interest (other than any interest 
  51 



paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); provided, that the Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as applicable, shall
repay the amount paid over to it pursuant to this paragraph (f) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as applicable, is required
to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority; provided, further, that in no event will the Administrative Agent or the Lender be required to pay any amount to the Borrower pursuant to this paragraph (f) to the extent such
payment would place the Administrative Agent or the Lender, as applicable, in a less favorable net after-Tax position than it would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or
otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any
other information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.  (g) For purposes of this
Section 4.10, if a Lender is treated as a domestic partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, any withholding or payment of U.S. withholding Tax by such Lender in respect of any such Lenders partners with respect to any payments
made by or on behalf of the Borrower or any other Loan Party under this Agreement shall be considered a withholding or payment of such Tax by the Borrower or such other Loan Party, as the case may be. 
(h) The obligations under this Section 4.10 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other
amounts payable hereunder or under any other Loan Document.  4.11 Indemnity. The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender and to
hold each Lender harmless from any direct, actual out-of-pocket loss, cost or expense (other than loss of anticipated profits) that such Lender may sustain or incur as a consequence of (a) default by the Borrower in making a borrowing of,
conversion into or continuation of LIBOR Loans after the Borrower has given a notice requesting the same in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, (b) default by the Borrower in making any prepayment of or conversion from LIBOR Loans
after the Borrower has given a notice thereof in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, (c) the making of a prepayment of or conversion from LIBOR Loans on a day that is not the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto or
(d) any other default by the Borrower in the repayment of LIBOR Loans when and as required pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. A certificate (including reasonably detailed backup calculations) as to any amounts payable pursuant to this
Section submitted to the Borrower by any Lender shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. This covenant shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder or under any
other Loan Document.  4.12 Change of Lending Office. Each Lender agrees that, upon the occurrence of any event giving rise to the
operation of Section 4.9 or 4.10(a) with respect to such Lender, it will, if requested by the Borrower, use reasonable efforts (subject to overall policy considerations of such Lender) to designate another lending office for any Loans affected
by such event with the objective of avoiding the consequences of such event; provided, that such designation is made on 
  52 



terms that, in the sole judgment of such Lender in good faith, cause such Lender and its lending office(s) to suffer no economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage; and provided,
further, that nothing in this Section shall affect or postpone any of the obligations of the Borrower or the rights of any Lender pursuant to Section 4.9 or 4.10(a). 
4.13 Replacement of Lenders. The Borrower shall be permitted to replace any Lender that (a) requests reimbursement for amounts
owing pursuant to Section 4.9 or payment of additional amounts pursuant to Section 4.10(a) (such Lender, an Affected Lender) or (b) is a Non-Consenting Lender, with a replacement Eligible Assignee; provided that
(i) such replacement does not conflict with any Requirement of Law, (ii) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such replacement, (iii) in the case of an Affected Lender, prior to any such
replacement, such Lender shall have declined or is unable to take any action under Section 4.12 so as to eliminate the continued need for payment of amounts owing pursuant to Section 4.9 or 4.10(a) and such replacement will result in an
elimination of, or reduction in, such reimbursement or payment of additional amounts thereafter, (iv) the replacement Eligible Assignee shall purchase, at par, all Loans and other amounts (excluding the amounts described in clause
(xi) below but including accrued but unpaid interest to the date of purchase) owing to such replaced Lender on or prior to the date of replacement, (v) the Borrower shall be liable to such replaced Lender under Section 4.11 if any
LIBOR Loan owing to such replaced Lender shall be purchased other than on the last day of the Interest Period relating thereto, (vi) the replacement financial institution, if not already a Lender or an Approved Fund or Affiliate of a Lender,
shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, (vii) the replaced Lender shall be obligated to make such replacement in accordance with the provisions of Section 11.6 (provided that the Borrower shall be obligated to pay the
registration and processing fee referred to therein), (viii) until such time as such replacement shall be consummated, the Borrower shall pay all additional amounts (if any) required pursuant to Section 4.9 or 4.10(a), as the case may be,
(ix) any such replacement shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any rights that the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any other Lender shall have against the replaced Lender, (x) in the case of a Non-Consenting Lender, the replacement
Eligible Assignee shall consent at the time of such assignment to each matter in respect of which the replaced Lender was a Non-Consenting Lender and (xi) in the event that a Non-Consenting Lender is replaced at any time prior to the second
anniversary of the Closing Date, the Borrower shall pay to such Non-Consenting Lender an amount equal to the fee or premium described in Section 4.1(b). Each Lender hereby grants to the Administrative Agent an irrevocable power of attorney
(which power is coupled with an interest) to execute and deliver, on behalf of such Lender, as assignor, any Assignment and Assumption necessary to effectuate any assignment of such Lenders interests hereunder in the circumstances contemplated
by this Section 4.13.  4.14 Evidence of Debt. (a) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an
account or accounts evidencing indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan of such Lender from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time under this
Agreement.  (b) The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, shall maintain the
Register pursuant to Section 11.6(b), and a subaccount therein for each Lender, in which shall be recorded (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder and any Note evidencing such Loan, the Type of such Loan and each Interest Period
applicable 
  53 



thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) both the amount of any sum
received by the Administrative Agent hereunder from the Borrower and each Lenders share thereof.  (c) The failure of any Lender or
the Administrative Agent to maintain the Register or any such account, or any error therein, shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay (with applicable interest) the Loans made by such Lender in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement.  (d) The Borrower agrees that, upon the request to the Administrative Agent by any Lender, the Borrower will execute and
deliver to such Lender a promissory note of the Borrower evidencing any Loans of such Lender, substantially in the form of Exhibit E with appropriate insertions as to date and principal amount. 
4.15 Illegality. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any Change in Law shall make it unlawful for
any Lender to make or maintain any LIBOR Loan or to give effect to its obligations as contemplated hereby with respect to any LIBOR Loan, then, by written notice to the Borrower and to the Administrative Agent, (i) such Lender may declare that
LIBOR Loans will not thereafter (for the duration of such unlawfulness) be made by such Lender hereunder (or be continued for additional Interest Periods) and Base Rate Loans will not thereafter (for such duration) be converted into LIBOR Loans,
whereupon any request for LIBOR Loans (or to convert Base Rate Loans into LIBOR Loans or to continue LIBOR Loans for an additional Interest Period) shall, as to such Lender only, be deemed a request for Base Rate Loans (or a request to continue Base
Rate Loans as such or to convert LIBOR Loans into Base Rate Loans, as the case may be), unless such declaration shall be subsequently withdrawn; and (ii) such Lender may require that all outstanding LIBOR Loans made by it be converted to Base
Rate Loans, in which event all such LIBOR Loans shall be automatically converted to Base Rate Loans as of the effective date of such notice as provided in paragraph (b) below. 
In the event any Lender shall exercise its rights under clause (i) or (ii) above, all payments and prepayments of principal that
would otherwise have been applied to repay the LIBOR Loans that would have been made by such Lender or the converted LIBOR Loans of such Lender shall instead be applied to repay the Base Rate Loans made by such Lender in lieu of, or resulting from
the conversion of, such LIBOR Loans.  (b) For purposes of this Section 4.15, a notice to the Borrower by any Lender shall be effective
as to each LIBOR Loan made by such Lender, if lawful, on the last day of the Interest Period then applicable to such LIBOR Loan; in all other cases such notice shall be effective on the date of receipt by the Borrower.

SECTION 5. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES 
To induce the Agents and the Lenders to enter into this Agreement and to make the Loans, the Borrower hereby represents and warrants to each
Agent and each Lender that as of the date hereof:  5.1 Financial Condition. (a) The unaudited pro forma consolidated balance
sheet and cash flows of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as of September 26, 2014 and the unaudited pro forma consolidated income statements for the twelve-month period ending as of such date, in each case as provided to the Agents on or prior
to the date hereof (the Pro Forma Financial Statements) have been prepared giving effect (as if such events had occurred on such date) to (i) the Loans to be made under this Agreement on the Closing Date and the use of
proceeds thereof and (ii) the payment of fees and expenses in connection with the foregoing. The Pro Forma Financial Statements have been prepared in good faith based on assumptions which the Borrower believed to be reasonable assumptions at
the time such Pro Forma Financial Statements were prepared and at the Closing Date (it being understood that such assumptions may or may not prove to be correct), and present fairly, in all material respects, on a pro forma basis the estimated
financial position of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as at and for each of the dates and periods set forth above, assuming that the events specified in the preceding sentence had actually occurred at such date, subject to year-end closing
adjustments.  (b) The audited consolidated balance sheets of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as of June 29, 2012, June 28,
2013 and June 27, 2014, and the related consolidated statements of income and of cash flows for the fiscal years ended on such dates, reported on by and accompanied by an unqualified report from Deloitte LLP, present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial condition of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as at such date, and the consolidated results of their operations and their consolidated cash flows for the respective fiscal years then ended. The unaudited
consolidated balance sheet of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries for each fiscal quarter ended after the last balance sheet delivered pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 5.1(b) and at least 45 days prior the Closing Date and the
related unaudited consolidated statements of income and cash flows for the period ended on such date present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial condition of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as at such date, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their consolidated cash flows for the period then ended (subject to normal year-end audit adjustments). All such financial statements referred to in the prior sentences, including the related schedules
and notes thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied consistently throughout the periods involved (except as approved by the aforementioned firm of accountants and disclosed therein). The most recent financial statements referred to
in this paragraph (b) disclose in accordance with GAAP or other applicable accounting standards all material Guarantee Obligations, material contingent liabilities and material liabilities for taxes, and any material long-term leases and
material unusual forward or long-term commitments, including any material interest rate and foreign currency swap or exchange transaction or other obligation in respect of derivatives, of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries. During the period from
June 27, 2014 to and including the date hereof there has been no Disposition by any Group Member of any material part of the business or property of the Group Members taken as a whole.

Material Adverse Effect.  5.3 Corporate Existence; Compliance with Law. Each Loan Party (a) is duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, (b) has the power and authority, and the legal right, to own and operate its Property and to conduct the business in which it is currently engaged, except to

the laws of such jurisdiction, in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction where its ownership, lease or operation of property or the conduct of its business requires such qualification, other than in any such jurisdiction where the failure
to be so qualified and in good standing could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect and (d) is in compliance with the terms of its Organizational Documents. Each Group Member is in compliance with all Requirements of Law
and all Governmental Authorizations except to the extent that the failure to comply with all Governmental Authorizations and Requirements of Law could not, in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. 
5.4 Power; Authorization; Enforceable Obligations. Each Loan Party has the power and authority, and the legal right, to make, deliver
and perform the Loan Documents to which it is a party and, in the case of the Borrower, to obtain extensions of credit hereunder. Each Loan Party has taken all necessary organizational and other action to authorize the execution, delivery and
performance of the Loan Documents to which it is a party and, in the case of the Borrower, to authorize the extensions of credit on the terms and conditions of this Agreement. No consent or authorization of, filing with, notice to or other act by or
in respect of, any Governmental Authority or any other Person is required to be obtained or made by or on behalf of any Loan Party in connection with the Transactions or with the execution, delivery, performance, validity or enforceability of this
Agreement or any of the Loan Documents, except (i) consents, authorizations, filings and notices described in Schedule 5.4, which consents, authorizations, filings and notices have been obtained or made and are in full force and effect and
(ii) the filings referred to in Section 5.19. Each Loan Document required to be delivered on or prior to the Closing Date has been duly executed and delivered on behalf of each Loan Party party thereto. This Agreement constitutes, and each
other Loan Document upon execution will constitute, a legal, valid and binding obligation of each Loan Party pa

 Legal Bar. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, the borrowings hereunder and
the use of the proceeds thereof will not (i) violate (A) the Organizational Documents of any Loan Party, (B) any Requirement of Law or any Governmental Authorization of or applicable to any Group Member in any respect that could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or (C) any material Contractual Obligation of any Group Member and (ii) result in, or require, the creation or imposition of any Lien (other than the Liens created by the Security
Documents and other than Liens permitted under Section 8.3) on any of their respective properties or revenues pursuant to its Organizational Documents, any Requirement of Law, any Governmental Authorization or any such material Contractual
Obligation.  5.6 Litigation. No litigation, investigation or proceeding of or before any arbitrator or Governmental Authority is
pending or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened by or against any Group Member or against any of their respective properties or revenues (a) with respect to the Transactions, any of the Loan Documents or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, or (b) that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

its material real property, and good title to, or a valid leasehold interest in, license of, or right to use, all its other material tangible property, and no such tangible property is subject to any Lien except as permitted by Section 8.3.
Schedule 5.8 lists, as of the Closing Date, each parcel of ow

y which is required for the business and operations of each Loan Party as presently conducted, in each case except as could not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.  5.9 Intellectual Property. Each Group Member owns, or has the legal right to use, all
Intellectual Property necessary for the conduct of its business as currently conducted, free and clear of all Liens (other than as permitted by Section 8.3), except for such Intellectual Property for which the failure to own or have such legal
right to use could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Except as could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, the conduct of, and the use of Intellectual Property in, the business of the Group Members
does not infringe, misappropriate, dilute, or otherwise violate the intellectual property or other rights of any other Person. Except as could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, (x) to the knowledge of the Borrower,
no Person is infringing, misappropriating, diluting, or otherwise violating any Intellectual Property of any Group Member, and (y) there has been no such claim asserted or threatened against any third party by any Group Member. 
5.10 Taxes. Except as could not, in each case, reasonably be expected to result in a liability in excess of $7,500,000, (a) each
of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries has, or caused to have been, duly and timely filed all tax returns that are required to be filed and has, or caused to have been, paid to the proper Governmental Authority prior to delinquency all taxes, fees or
other charges imposed on it or any of its property by any Governmental Authority (other than any tax, fee or other charge the amount or validity of which is currently being contested diligently in good faith by appropriate proceedings and with
respect to which adequate reserves in conformity with GAAP have been provided on the books of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries), (b) all such filed tax returns are correct, accurate and true in all material respects, (c) there are no tax

  57 



the quoted terms under Regulation U as now and from time to time hereafter in effect or for any purpose that violates the provisions of the Regulations of the Board. If requested by any Lender or
the Administrative Agent, the Borrower will furnish to the Administrative Agent and each Lender a statement to the foregoing effect in conformity with the requirements of FR Form G-3 or FR Form U 1, as applicable, referred to in Regulation U. No
Loan Party is engaged principally, or as one of its important activities, in the business of extending credit for the purposing of buying or carrying margin stock within the respective meanings of each of the
quoted terms under Regulation U as now and from time to time hereafter in effect.  5.12 Labor Matters. Except as could not, in each

to the Borrower, automatically the Commitments shall immediately terminate and the Loans hereunder (with accrued interest thereon) and all other amounts owing under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall immediately become due and
payable, and (B) if such event is any other Event of Default, any or all of the following actions may be taken: (i) with the consent of the Required Lenders, the Administrative Agent may, or upon the request of the Required Lenders, the

10.1 Appointment. Each Lender hereby irrevocably designates and appoints each Agent as the agent of such Lender under this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents, and each such Lender irrevocably authorizes such Agent, in such capacity, to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and to exercise such powers and perform
such duties as are delegated to such Agent by the terms of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, together with such other powers and actions as are reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary elsewhere in this
Agreement, no Agent shall have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, or any fiduciary relationship with any Lender or other Secured Party, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations
or liabilities shall be read into this 
  89 



Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise exist against any Agent. The provisions of this Section 10 are solely for the benefit of the Agents and the Lenders and neither the Borrower
nor any other Loan Party shall have rights as a third-party beneficiary of any of such provisions. It is understood and agreed that the use of the term agent (or any other similar term) herein or in any other Loan Documents with
reference to the Agents is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law. Instead such term is used as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or
reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting parties.  10.2 Delegation of Duties. Each Agent may perform any and
all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub agents appointed by such Agent. Each Agent and any such sub agent of such Agent may perform any and all of its duties
and exercise its rights and powers by or through its respective Related Parties and those of such Persons Affiliates. The exculpatory provisions of this Section 10 shall apply to any such sub agent and to the Related Parties of such
Person and that of such Persons Affiliates of each Agent and any such sub agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the Facility as well as their activities as the Agents. No Agent shall be
responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any sub-agents except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and nonappealable judgment that such Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the
selection of such sub agents.  10.3 Exculpatory Provisions. Neither any Agent nor any of their respective officers, directors,
employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates shall (i) be liable for any action lawfully taken or omitted to be taken by it or such Person under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document (except to the extent that
any of the foregoing are found by a final and nonappealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from its or such Persons own gross negligence or willful misconduct), (ii) be responsible in any manner to any of
the Lenders or any other Secured Party for or have a duty to ascertain or inquire into (A) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement, any other Loan Document, any Specified Hedge Agreement or any
Specified Cash Management Agreement, (B) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (C) the performance or observance of any of the covenants,
agreements or other terms or conditions set forth in any Loan Document, any Specified Hedge Agreement, any Specified Cash Management Agreement or the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, (D) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness
or genuineness of any Loan Document, any Specified Hedge Agreement, any Specified Cash Management Agreement or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (E) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Section 6 or elsewhere in any
Loan Document, any Specified Hedge Agreement or any Specified Cash Management Agreement, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to such Agent, (iii) have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise
any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that such Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage
of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents); provided that such Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose such Agent to liability
or that is contrary to any Loan 
  90 



Document or applicable law, including for the avoidance of doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under United States Bankruptcy Code, state bankruptcy law or similar law
or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any United States Bankruptcy Code, state bankruptcy law or similar law or (iv) not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the
other Loan Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as an Agent or any of
its Affiliates in any capacity. The Agents shall not be under any obligation to any Lender to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the agreements or covenants contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any
other Loan Document, any Specified Hedge Agreement or any Specified Cash Management Agreement, or to inspect the properties, books or records of any Loan Party or any other Person. 
10.4 Reliance by Agents. Each Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any instrument, writing,
resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telecopy, telex or teletype message, statement, order or other document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) or
conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to the Borrower), independent accountants and other
experts selected by such Agent and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts. The Administrative Agent may deem and treat the Lender specified in the
Register with respect to any amount owing hereunder as the owner thereof for all purposes. Each Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement or any other Loan Document unless it shall first receive
such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all Lenders) as it deems appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense that may be
incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Agents shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents in accordance with a request of the
Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all Lenders), and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Lenders and all future holders of the Loans and all other Secured Parties.
In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender, each Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender unless such Agent shall
have received notice to the contrary from such Lender prior to the making of such Loan.  10.5 Notice of Default. No Agent shall be
deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default hereunder unless such Agent has received notice from a Lender or the Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and
stating that such notice is a notice of default. In the event that the Administrative Agent receives such a notice, the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall take such action with
respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be reasonably directed by the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all Lenders or any other instructing group of Lenders specified by this Agreement); provided that
unless and until the Administrative Agent shall have received such directions, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it
shall deem advisable in the best interests of the Secured Parties. 
  91 


10.6 Non-Reliance on Agents and Other Lenders. Each Lender expressly acknowledges that
neither the Agents nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates have made any representations or warranties to it and that no act by any Agent hereafter taken, including any review of the
affairs of a Loan Party or any affiliate of a Loan Party, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by any Agent to any Lender. Each Lender represents to the Agents that it has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or
any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of, and investigation into, the business, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Loan Parties
and their affiliates and made its own decision to make its Loans hereunder and enter into this Agreement, any Specified Hedge Agreement or any Specified Cash Management Agreement. Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and without
reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender or any other Secured Party, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking
action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, any Specified Hedge Agreement or any Specified Cash Management Agreement, and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, operations, property,
financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Loan Parties and their affiliates. Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent hereunder, no Agent shall have
any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, operations, property, condition (financial or otherwise), prospects or creditworthiness of any Loan Party or any Affiliate of a Loan Party
that may come into the possession of such Agent or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates. 
10.7 Indemnification. To the extent that the Borrower for any reason fails to indefeasibly pay any amount required under
Section 11.5 to be paid by it to any Agent Related Party (or any sub-agent thereof), each Lender severally agrees to pay to such Agent Related Party (or any such sub-agent thereof) such Lenders Aggregate Exposure Percentage (determined as
of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount; provided that (a) the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be,
was incurred by or asserted against any Agent Related Party (or any such sub-agent thereof) and (b) no Lender shall be liable for the payment of any portion of such unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related
expense that is found by a final and nonappealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such Agents gross negligence or willful misconduct (and no action taken in accordance with the directions of the Required
Lender shall be deemed to constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct for purposes of this Section). The agreements in this Section shall survive the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder. 
10.8 Agent in Its Individual Capacity. Each Person serving as an Agent and its affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from and
generally engage in any kind of business with any Loan Party as though such Person were not an Agent and, with respect to its Loans and 
  92 



Commitments, each such Person shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as any Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not an Agent, and
the terms Lender, Lenders, Secured Party and Secured Parties shall include each Agent in its individual capacity. Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from,
lend money to, own securities of, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for, and generally engage in any kind of business with, the Borrower or any Subsidiary of the Borrower or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were
not an Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.  10.9 Successor Agents. Either Agent may resign at
any time by notifying the Lenders and the Borrower. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the Borrower, to appoint a successor. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders
and shall have accepted such appointment within 45 days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Agent which shall be a financial institution with an
office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such financial institution. If no successor Agent has been appointed pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence by the 45th day after the
date such notice of resignation was given by such Agent, such Agents resignation shall nonetheless become effective (and such Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder (except that in the case of any collateral
security held by the retiring Agent on behalf of the Secured Parties under any of the Loan Documents, the retiring Agent shall continue to hold such collateral security as nominee until such time as a successor Agent is appointed)) and the Required
Lenders shall thereafter perform all the duties of such Agent hereunder and/or under any other Loan Document until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent and/or Collateral Agent, as the case may be. Upon
the acceptance of its appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its
duties and obligations hereunder (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above). The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and
such successor. After an Agents resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Section 10 and Section 11.5 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect
of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while acting as Agent.  10.10 Agents Generally. Except as expressly set
forth herein, no Agent shall have any duties or responsibilities hereunder in its capacity as such.  10.11 Lead Arranger.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, the Lead Arranger is named as such for recognition purposes only, and in its capacity as such shall have no duties, responsibilities or liabilities with respect to
this Agreement or any other Loan Document; it being understood and agreed that the Lead Arranger shall be entitled to all indemnification and reimbursement rights in favor of the Agents provided herein and in the other Loan Documents. Without
limitation of the foregoing, the Lead Arranger in its capacity as such shall not, by reason of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, have any fiduciary relationship in respect of any Lender, Loan Party or any other Person.

10.12 Insolvency or Liquidation Proceedings. In case of the pendency of any Insolvency or
Liquidation Proceeding or any other judicial proceeding relative to any Loan Party, each Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of
whether such Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered (but not obligated) by intervention or otherwise in such proceeding or otherwise (a) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal
and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans and all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Secured Parties and the Agents (including
any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Secured Parties and the Agents and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due to the Secured Parties and Agents under Section 11.5)
allowed in such judicial proceeding and (b) to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same and, in either case, any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator,
sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender and each other Secured Party to make such payments to such Agent and, in the event that such Agent shall consent to the making of such
payments directly to the Secured Parties, to pay to such Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of such Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due such Agent under
Section 11.5.  10.13 Tax Indemnification by the Lenders. Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent,
within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Non-Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that no Loan Party has already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Non-Excluded Taxes and without limiting the
obligation of the Borrower and the other Loan Parties to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lenders failure to comply with the provisions of Section 11.6(c) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and
(iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect
thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be
conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise payable by the
Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this Section 10.13. 
10.14 Cash Management Banks and Qualified Counterparties. No Cash Management Bank or Qualified Counterparty that obtains the benefits
of the Security Documents or any Collateral by virtue of the provisions hereof or of the Security Documents shall have any right to notice of any action or to consent to, direct or object to any action hereunder or under any other Loan Document or
otherwise in respect of the Collateral (including the release or impairment of any Collateral) other than in its capacity as a Lender and, in such case, only to the extent expressly provided in the Loan Documents. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Section 10 to the contrary, the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent shall not be required to verify the payment of, or that other satisfactory arrangements have been made with respect to, 
  94 



Obligations arising under Specified Cash Management Agreements and Specified Hedge Agreements unless the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, has received written notice
of such Obligations, together with such supporting documentation as the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, may request, from the applicable Cash Management Bank or Qualified Counterparty, as the case may be. 
10.15 Intercreditor Agreements. The Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, is hereby irrevocably authorized by
each of the Lenders, without requiring further action by the Lenders (and shall, upon the written request of the Borrower), to (and to execute any documents or instruments necessary to) enter into any Intercreditor Agreements and any other
intercreditor arrangements contemplated by the terms hereof, and the parties hereto acknowledge that such intercreditor agreements are binding upon them. Each Lender (a) hereby agrees that it will be bound by and will take no actions contrary
to the provisions of any Intercreditor Agreements, (b) hereby authorizes and instructs the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent to enter into any Intercreditor Agreements and to subject the Liens on the Collateral securing the
Obligations to the provisions thereof and (c) without any further consent of the Lenders, hereby authorizes and instructs the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent to negotiate, execute and deliver on behalf of the Secured Parties any
intercreditor agreement or any amendment (or amendment and restatement) to the Security Documents. In addition, each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent, without requiring further action by the Lenders, to
enter into (i) any amendments to Intercreditor Agreements, and (ii) any other intercreditor arrangements, in the case of clauses (i), and (ii) to the extent required to give effect to the establishment of intercreditor rights and
privileges as contemplated and required or permitted by Section 8.3 of this Agreement. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that any of the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent (or one or more of their respective Affiliates) may (but
are not obligated to) act as the senior representative or like term for the holders of Indebtedness pursuant to Refinancing Loans under the security agreements with respect thereto or any Intercreditor Agreement. Each Lender waives any
conflict of interest, now contemplated or arising hereafter, in connection therewith and agrees not to assert against any Agent or any of its affiliates any claims, causes of action, damages or liabilities of whatever kind or nature relating
thereto.  10.16 Security Documents. (a) Each Secured Party hereby further authorizes the Administrative Agent or the
Collateral Agent, as applicable, on behalf of and for the benefit of Secured Parties, to be the agent for and representative of Secured Parties with respect to the Collateral and the Security Documents; provided that neither the
Administrative Agent nor the Collateral Agent shall owe any fiduciary duty, duty of loyalty, duty of care, duty of disclosure or any other obligation whatsoever to any holder of Obligations with respect to any Specified Cash Management Agreement or
Specified Hedge Agreement. Subject to Section 11.1, without further written consent or authorization from any Secured Party, the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, may execute any documents or instruments necessary to
(i) in connection with a sale or disposition of assets permitted by this Agreement, release any Lien encumbering any item of Collateral that is the subject of such sale or other disposition of assets or to which the Required Lenders (or such
other Lenders as may be required to give such consent under Section 11.1) have otherwise consented or (ii) release any Guarantor from the Security Documents or with respect to which the Required Lenders (or such other Lenders as may be
required to give such consent under Section 11.1) have otherwise consented. 
  95 


(b) Anything contained in any of the Loan Documents to the contrary notwithstanding, the
Borrower, the Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent and each Secured Party hereby agree that (i) no Secured Party shall have any right individually to realize upon any of the Collateral or to enforce the guaranty of the Guarantors, it being
understood and agreed that all powers, rights and remedies hereunder may be exercised solely by Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Secured Parties in accordance with the terms hereof and all powers, rights and remedies under the Security
Documents may be exercised solely by the Collateral Agent, and (ii) in the event of a foreclosure by the Collateral Agent on any of the Collateral pursuant to a public or private sale or other disposition, the Collateral Agent or any Lender may
be the purchaser or licensor of any or all of such Collateral at any such sale or other disposition and the Collateral Agent, as agent for and representative of Secured Parties (but not any Lender or Lenders in its or their respective individual
capacities unless the Required Lenders shall otherwise agree in writing) shall be entitled, for the purpose of bidding and making settlement or payment of the purchase price for all or any portion of the Collateral sold at any such public sale, to
use and apply any of the Obligations as a credit on account of the purchase price for any collateral payable by the Collateral Agent at such sale or other disposition. 
SECTION 11. MISCELLANEOUS 
11.1 Amendments and Waivers. Neither this Agreement, any other Loan Document, nor any terms hereof or thereof may be amended,
supplemented or modified except in accordance with the provisions of this Section 11.1. The Required Lenders and each Loan Party party to the relevant Loan Document may, or, with the written consent of the Required Lenders, the Administrative
Agent and each Loan Party party to the relevant Loan Document may, from time to time, (a) enter into written amendments, supplements or modifications hereto and to the other Loan Documents for the purpose of adding any provisions to this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents or changing in any manner the rights of the Lenders or of the Loan Parties hereunder or thereunder or (b) waive, on such terms and conditions as the Required Lenders or the Administrative Agent, as the case
may be, may specify in such instrument, any of the requirements of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or any Default or Event of Default and its consequences; provided, however, that amendments pursuant to Section 3.3 may
be effected without the consent of the Required Lenders to the extent provided therein; provided, further, that no such waiver and no such amendment, supplement or modification shall (i) forgive the principal amount or (except as
provided in Section 3.3) extend the final scheduled date of maturity of any Loan, extend the scheduled date of any amortization payment in respect of any Loan, reduce the stated rate of any interest or forgive or reduce any interest or fee
payable hereunder (except in connection with the waiver of the applicability of any post-default increase in interest rates, which waiver shall be effective with the consent of the Required Lenders) or extend the scheduled date of any payment
thereof, or increase the amount or extend the expiration date of any Lenders Commitment, in each case without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby; (ii) eliminate or reduce the voting rights of any Lender under
this Section 11.1 without the written consent of such Lender; (iii) reduce any percentage specified in the definition of Required Lenders or consent to the assignment or transfer by the Borrower of any of its rights and obligations under
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, in each case without the written consent of all Lenders; (iv) release all or substantially all of the Collateral or release all or substantially all of the value of the guarantees provided by the

of all Lenders; (vi) amend, modify or waive any provision of Section 10 without the written consent of each Agent adversely affected thereby; (vii) amend, modify or waive any provision of Section 11.6 to further restrict any
Lenders ability to assign or otherwise transfer its obligations hereunder without the written consent of all Lenders; (viii) amend, modify or waive (A) any provision of any Loan Document so as to alter the ratable treatment of
Obligations under Specified Hedge Agreements with the other Obligations or (B) the definition of Qualified Counterparty, Specified Hedge Agreement, or Obligations, in each case in a
manner adverse to any Qualified Counterparty with Obligations then outstanding without the written consent of any such Qualified Counterparty; (ix) amend, modify or waive (A) any provision of any Loan Document so as to alter the ratable
treatment of Obligations under Specified Cash Management Agreements with the other Obligations or (B) the definition of Cash Management Bank, Specified Cash Management Agreement, or
Obligations, in each case in a manner adverse to any Cash Management Bank with Obligations then outstanding without the written consent of any such Cash Management Bank or (x) alter the required application of any repayments
or prepayments as between Classes pursuant to Sections 4.1, 4.2 or 4.8(b) without the consent of Lenders holding more than 50.0% of the aggregate exposure of all Lenders, as applicable, of each Class which is being allocated a lesser repayment or
prepayment as a result thereof; provided, that, Required Lenders may waive, in whole or in part, any prepayment so long as the application, as between Classes, of any portion of such prepayment which is still required to be made is not
altered. Any such waiver and any such amendment, supplement or modification shall apply equally to each of the Lenders and shall be binding upon the Loan Parties, the Lenders, the Agents and all future holders of the Loans. In the case of any
waiver, the Loan Parties, the Lenders and the Agents shall be restored to their former position and rights hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, and any Default or Event of Default waived shall be deemed to be cured and not continuing; but
no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or Event of Default, or impair any right consequent thereon. 
Notwithstanding anything herein or in any other Loan Document to the contrary, this Agreement and the other Loan Documents may be amended
(x) to cure any ambiguity, mistake, omission, defect, or inconsistency or (y) to provide for any amendments as may be necessary or appropriate, in the opinion of Administrative Agent, to effect the provisions of Sections 3.3 and 3.4, in
each case with the written consent of the relevant Loan Parties and the Administrative Agent but without the consent of any Lender. 
Notwithstanding anything herein or in any other Loan Document to the contrary, this Agreement may be amended (or amended and restated) with
the written consent of the Required Lenders, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower (a) to add one or more additional credit facilities to this Agreement and to permit the extensions of credit from time to time outstanding thereunder and the
accrued interest and fees in respect thereof (collectively, the Additional Extensions of Credit) to share ratably in the benefits of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents with the Loans and the accrued interest and fees in
respect thereof and (b) to include appropriately the Lenders holding such credit facilities in any determination of the Required Lenders. 
  97 


Notwithstanding anything herein or in any other Loan Document to the contrary, during such period
as a Lender is a Defaulting Lender, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, such Lender will not be entitled to vote in respect of amendments and waivers hereunder and the Commitment and the outstanding Loans or other extensions of credit
of such Lender hereunder will not be taken into account in determining whether the Required Lenders or all of the Lenders or each directly affected Lender, as required, have approved any such amendment or waiver (and the definition of
Required Lenders will automatically be deemed modified accordingly for the duration of such period); provided, that any such amendment or waiver that would increase or extend the term of the Commitment of such Defaulting
Lender, extend the date fixed for the payment of principal or interest or fees owing to such Defaulting Lender hereunder, reduce the principal amount of any obligation owing to such Defaulting Lender, reduce the amount of or the rate or amount of
interest on any amount owing to such Defaulting Lender or of any fee payable to such Defaulting Lender hereunder, or alter the terms of this paragraph, will require the consent of such Defaulting Lender. 
In the case of any amendment, waiver, supplement or modification to any of the Loan Documents for which the consent of the Required Lenders
(or each Lender or each directly affected Lender, as the case may be) is required, each Lender that consents to such amendment, waiver, supplement or modification shall be entitled to the same fees or other compensation or consideration in
connection therewith (whether in cash, securities, warrants, other Capital Stock or otherwise), as a percentage of its outstanding Loans, that is paid to other Lenders (as a percentage of such other Lenders Loans) consenting to such amendment,
waiver, supplement or modification.  11.2 Notices; Electronic Communications. (a) Except in the case of notices and other
communications expressly permitted to be given by telephone (and except for electronic communication provided below), all notices and other communications provided for herein shall be in writing and shall be delivered by hand or overnight courier

  98 


Notices sent by hand or overnight courier service, or mailed by certified or registered mail,
shall be deemed to have been given when received; notices sent by facsimile shall be deemed to have been given when sent (except that, if not given during normal business hours for the recipient, shall be deemed to have been given at the opening of
business on the next Business Day for the recipient). Notices delivered through electronic communications, to the extent provided in the immediately following paragraph, shall be effective as provided in said paragraph. 
Notices and other communications to the Lenders hereunder may be delivered or furnished by electronic communication (including e-mail and Internet or intranet websites) pursuant to procedures approved by the Administrative Agent; provided that the foregoing shall not apply to notices to any Lender pursuant to Section 2, 3 and 4
if such Lender has notified the Administrative Agent that it is incapable of receiving notices under such Sections 2, 3 and 4 by electronic communication. The Administrative Agent or the Borrower may, in its discretion, agree to accept notices and
other communications to it hereunder by electronic communications pursuant to procedures approved by it; provided that approval of such procedures may be limited to particular notices or communications. Unless the Administrative Agent
otherwise prescribes, (i) notices and other communications sent to an e-mail address shall be deemed received upon the senders receipt of an acknowledgement from the intended recipient (such as by the return receipt requested
function, as available, return e-mail or other written acknowledgement), and (ii) notices or communications posted to an Internet or intranet website shall be deemed received upon the deemed receipt by the intended recipient, at its e-mail
address as described in the foregoing clause (i), of notification that such notice or communication is available and identifying the website address therefor; provided that, for both clauses (i) and (ii) above, if such notice,
email or other communication is not sent during the normal business hours of the recipient, such notice or communication shall be deemed to have been sent at the opening of business on the next Business Day for the recipient. Each Lender agrees to
notify the Administrative Agent in writing (including by electronic communication) from time to time of such Lenders e-mail address to which the foregoing notices may be sent by electronic transmission and that the foregoing notice may be sent
to such e-mail address.  Any party hereto may change its address or facsimile number for notices and other communications hereunder by
notice to the other parties hereto (provided that any Lender may change its address or facsimile number by notice solely to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower). 
The Borrower agrees that the Administrative Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, make the Communications (as defined below) available to
the Lenders by posting the Communications on Debt Domain, Intralinks, Syndtrak or a substantially similar electronic transmission system (the Platform). The Platform is provided as is and as available. The
Administrative Agent and its Administrative Agent Parties do not warrant the adequacy of the Platform and expressly disclaim liability for errors or omissions in the Communications. No warranty of any kind, express, implied or statutory, including,
without limitation, any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement of third-party rights or freedom from viruses or other code defects, is made by Administrative Agent or any of its Administrative Agent Parties
in connection with the Communications or the Platform. In no event shall the Administrative Agent or any of its Administrative Agent Parties have any liability 
  99 



to the Borrower or the other Loan Parties, any Lender or any other Person or entity for damages of any kind, including, without limitation, direct or indirect, special, incidental or
consequential damages, losses or expenses (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) arising out of the Borrowers, any Loan Partys or the Administrative Agents transmission of communications through the Platform.
Communications means, collectively, any notice, demand, communication, information, document or other material that any Loan Party provides to the Administrative Agent pursuant to any Loan Document or the transactions contemplated
therein which is distributed to the Administrative Agent or any Lender by means of electronic communications pursuant to this Section 11.2, including through the Platform. 
The Administrative Agent agrees that the receipt of the Communications by the Administrative Agent at its e-mail address set forth above shall
constitute effective delivery of the Communications to the Administrative Agent for purposes of the Loan Documents. Each Lender agrees that notice to it (as provided in the next sentence) specifying that the Communications have been posted to the
Platform shall constitute effective delivery of the Communications to such Lender for purposes of the Loan Documents. Each Lender agrees (i) to notify the Administrative Agent in writing (including by electronic communication) from time to time
of such Lenders e-mail address to which the foregoing notice may be sent by electronic transmission and (ii) that the foregoing notice may be sent to such e-mail address. Nothing herein shall prejudice the right of the Administrative
Agent or any Lender to give any notice or other communication pursuant to any Loan Document in any other manner specified in such Loan Document. 
The Borrower hereby acknowledges that (a) the Administrative Agent will make available to the Lenders materials and/or information
provided by or on behalf of the Borrower hereunder (collectively, the Borrower Materials) by posting the Borrower Materials on the Platform and (b) certain of the Lenders may be public-side Lenders (i.e., Lenders
that do not wish to receive material non-public information with respect to the Borrower, its Affiliates or their respective securities) (each, a Public Lender). The Borrower hereby agrees that (w) all Borrower Materials that
are to be made available to Public Lenders shall be clearly and conspicuously marked PUBLIC which, at a minimum, shall mean that the word PUBLIC shall appear prominently on the first page thereof; (x) by marking Borrower
Materials PUBLIC, the Borrower shall be deemed to have authorized the Administrative Agent and the Lenders to treat the Borrower Materials as not containing any material non-public information with respect to the Borrower, its Affiliates
or their respective securities for purposes of United States Federal and state securities laws (provided, however, that to the extent the Borrower Materials constitute Information, they shall be treated as set forth in
Section 11.15); (y) all Borrower Materials marked PUBLIC are permitted to be made available through a portion of the Platform designated as Public Investor; and (z) the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to
treat the Borrower Materials that are not marked PUBLIC as being suitable only for posting on a portion of the Platform not marked as Public Investor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following Borrower Materials shall be
marked PUBLIC, unless the Borrower notifies the Administrative Agent promptly that any such document contains material non-public information: (1) the Loan Documents and (2) notification of changes in the terms thereof. 
Each Public Lender agrees to cause at least one individual at or on behalf of such Public Lender to at all times have selected the
Private Side Information or similar designation 
  100 



on the content declaration screen of the Platform in order to enable such Public Lender or its delegate, in accordance with such Public Lenders compliance procedures and applicable law,
including United States Federal and state securities laws, to make reference to Communications that are not made available through the Public Side Information portion of the Platform and that may contain material non-public information
with respect to the Borrower, its Affiliates or their respective securities for purposes of United States Federal or state securities laws. 
11.3 No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies. No failure to exercise and no delay in exercising, on the part of any Agent or any Lender, any
right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder or under the other Loan Documents shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. The rights, remedies, powers and privileges herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided by law. 
11.4 Survival of Representations and Warranties. All representations and warranties made hereunder, in the other Loan Documents and in
any document, certificate or statement delivered pursuant hereto or in connection herewith shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the making of the Loans and other extensions of credit hereunder. 
11.5 Indemnification; Expenses. The Borrower agrees (a) to pay or reimburse each Agent for all its reasonable and documented out
of pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with the development, preparation and execution of, and any amendment, supplement or modification to, this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and any other documents prepared in connection
herewith or therewith, and the consummation and administration of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the reasonable and documented fees, charges and disbursements of one primary counsel (with exceptions for conflicts of
interest) and one local counsel in each relevant jurisdiction to such Agent and filing and recording fees and expenses, with statements with respect to the foregoing to be submitted to the Borrower prior to the Closing Date (in the case of amounts
to be paid on the Closing Date) and from time to time thereafter as such Agent shall deem appropriate, (b) to pay or reimburse each Lender and Agent for all its costs and expenses incurred in connection with the enforcement or preservation of
any rights under this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and any such other documents, including the reasonable and documented fees, charges and disbursements of one primary counsel (with exceptions for conflicts of interest) and one local counsel
in each relevant jurisdiction to the Lenders and Agents, (c) to pay, indemnify, and hold each Lender and Agent harmless from, any and all recording and filing fees and any and all liabilities with respect to, or resulting from any delay in
paying, stamp, excise and other taxes, if any, that may be payable or determined to be payable in connection with the execution and delivery of, or consummation or administration of any of the transactions contemplated by, or any amendment,
supplement or modification of, or any waiver or consent under or in respect of, this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and any such other documents, and (d) to pay, indemnify, and hold each Lender and Agent and their respective Affiliates and
their respective officers, directors, employees, advisors, affiliates, agents, successors, partners, representatives and assigns (each, an Indemnitee) harmless from and against any and all other liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever with respect to the execution, delivery, enforcement, performance and administration of this Agreement, the 
  101 



other Loan Documents (regardless of whether such Person or any Loan Party is or is not a party to any such actions or suits and regardless of whether the Indemnitee is the plaintiff or defendant
in such actions or suits) and any such other documents, including any of the foregoing relating to the use of proceeds of the Loans or the violation of, noncompliance with or liability under, any Environmental Law applicable to the operations of any
Group Member or any of the Properties and the reasonable and documented fees and expenses of one primary counsel (with exceptions for conflicts of interest) and one local counsel in each relevant jurisdiction in connection with claims, actions or
proceedings by any Indemnitee against any Loan Party under any Loan Document (all the foregoing in this clause (d), collectively, the Indemnified Liabilities); provided, that the Borrower shall not have any obligation
hereunder to any Indemnitee with respect to Indemnified Liabilities to the extent such Indemnified Liabilities (x) are found by a final and nonappealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence
or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee (or such Indemnitees affiliates, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, partners, representatives, advisors or agents), (y) are found by a final and nonappealable decision of a court
of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the material breach of the obligations of such Indemnitee (or such Indemnitees affiliates, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, partners, representatives, advisors or agents)
under the Loan Documents or (z) arises out of, or in connection with, any proceeding between or among Indemnitees that does not involve an act or omission by the Borrower or its Subsidiaries (other than claims against any Agent or the Lead
Arranger in its capacity or in fulfilling its role as Agent or Lead Arranger or any similar role hereunder (excluding its role as a Lender)). Without limiting the foregoing, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower agrees not to
assert and to cause its Subsidiaries not to assert, and hereby waives and agrees to cause its Subsidiaries to waive, all rights for contribution or any other rights of recovery with respect to all claims, demands, penalties, fines, liabilities,
settlements, damages, costs and expenses of whatever kind or nature, under or related to Environmental Laws, that any of them might have by statute or otherwise against any Indemnitee. All amounts due under this Section 11.5 shall be payable
not later than 10 days after written demand therefor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 11.5 shall not apply to Taxes other than any Taxes that represent Indemnified Liabilities arising from any non-Tax claim. The agreements in this
Section 11.5 shall survive repayment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.  11.6 Successors and Assigns;
Participations and Assignments. (a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that (i) the Borrower may
not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and each Lender (and any attempted assignment or transfer by the Borrower without such consent shall be null
and void) and (ii) no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer its rights or obligations hereunder except in accordance with this Section. 
(b) (i) Subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(ii) below, any Lender may assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all or a
portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitments and the Loans at the time owing to it) with the prior written consent (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned) of: 
  102 


(A) the Borrower; provided that no consent of the Borrower shall be
required for an (x) assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender, an Approved Fund or, if a Specified Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, any other Eligible Assignee or (y) any assignment prior to the completion of the
primary syndication of the Facility (as determined by the Lead Arranger); and provided, further that such consent of the Borrower shall have been deemed to have been given if the Borrower has not responded within ten Business Days of a
request for such consent; and  (B) the Administrative Agent. 
(ii) Assignments shall be subject to the following additional conditions: 
(A) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund, an assignment effected by
the Lead Arranger (or any of its Affiliates) in connection with the primary syndication of the Commitments or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lenders Commitments or Loans, the amount of the Commitments or Loans of
the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $1,000,000 unless each of the Borrower and
the Administrative Agent otherwise consent; provided that (1) no such consent of the Borrower shall be required if a Specified Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, (2) that such consent of the Borrower shall have been
deemed to have been given if the Borrower has not responded within ten Business Days of a request for such consent and (3) such amounts shall be aggregated in respect of each Lender and its affiliates or Approved Funds, if any; 
(B) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together
with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500 (which may be waived by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion) (it being understood that payment of only one processing fee shall be required in connection with simultaneous assignments to
two or more Approved Funds); and  (C) the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent
an administrative questionnaire.  (iii) Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to paragraph (b)(iv) below,
from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender
under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption
covering all of the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 4.9, 4.10, 4.11 and 11.5; provided, that such
Lender continues to comply with the requirements of Section 4.10(e)). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 11.6 shall be treated for purposes of this
Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section. 
  103 


(iv) The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary
agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amount (and
stated interest) of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the Register). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive (absent manifest error), and the Borrower, the Administrative
Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register
shall be available for inspection by the Borrower, the Collateral Agent and any Lender at the Administrative Agents office, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. 
(v) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the
assignees completed administrative questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section (unless waived by the Administrative Agent in its
sole discretion) and any written consent to such assignment required by paragraph (b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information contained therein in the Register. No
assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless and until it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph. The date of such recordation of a transfer shall be referred to herein as the Assignment
Effective Date.  (vi) On or prior to the Assignment Effective Date, the assigning Lender shall surrender any
outstanding Notes held by it all or a portion of which are being assigned. Any Notes surrendered by the assigning Lender shall be returned by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower marked cancelled. 
(vii) With respect to any assignment after the completion of the primary syndication of the Facility (as determined by the Lead
Arranger), the Borrower shall not be obligated to make any greater payment under Section 4.9 or Section 4.10 than the Borrower would have been obligated to make in the absence of any such assignment, unless the Borrower has expressly
consented in writing to waive the benefit of this provision at the time of such assignment or such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the assignee becomes a Lender. 
(c) (i) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to one or more banks or other
entities (other than a natural Person or a Defaulting Lender) (a Participant) in all or a portion of such Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitments and the Loans owing
to it); provided that (A) such Lenders obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, (C) the
Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and the other 
  104 



Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement, (D) no participation shall be permitted
to be made to the Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries, any of their respective Affiliates, nor any officer or director of any such Person and (E) such Lender shall remain the holder of any such Loan for all purposes under this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents. Any agreement pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of
this Agreement; provided that such agreement may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver that (1) (a) requires the consent of each Lender directly
affected thereby pursuant to the second proviso to the second sentence of Section 11.1 and (b) directly affects such Participant or (2) requires the consent of all Lenders pursuant to the second proviso to the second sentence of
Section 11.1. Subject to paragraph (c)(ii) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 4.9, 4.10 and 4.11 (subject to the requirements and limitations therein, including the
requirements of Section 4.10(e) (it being understood that the documentation required under Section 4.10(e) shall be delivered to the participating Lender)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by
assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 11.7(b) as though it were a Lender; provided such Participant shall be subject
to Section 11.7(a) as though it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each
Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participants interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the Participant Register); provided that no Lender shall have any
obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participants interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under
any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury
Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this
Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register. 
(ii) The Borrower shall not be obligated to make any greater payment under Section 4.9 or 4.10 than the Borrower would
have been obligated to make in the absence of any participation sold to such Participant, unless the Borrower has expressly consented in writing to waive the benefit of this provision at the time of the sale of such participation or such entitlement
to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation. Any Participant that would be a Non-U.S. Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of
Section 4.10 unless such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Sections 4.12 and 4.13 as though it were a Lender. 
  105 


(d) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its
rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank or any other Person, and may sell or securitize such obligations, and this Section shall not apply
to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest or to any such sale or securitization; provided that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any
such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender that is a Fund may (without the consent of or notice to the Administrative Agent or the Borrower) grant a
security interest in all or any portion of the Loans owing to it and the Notes (if any) held by it to the trustee or other representative of holders of obligations owed, or securities issued, by such Fund as security for such obligations or
securities; provided that unless and until such trustee or other representative actually becomes a Lender in compliance with the other provisions of this Section, (i) no such pledge shall release the pledging Lender from any of its
obligations under this Agreement and (ii) such trustee or other representative shall not be entitled to exercise any of the rights of a Lender under this Agreement and the Notes (if any) even though such trustee may have acquired ownership
rights with respect to the pledged interest through foreclosure or otherwise.  (e) The Borrower, upon receipt of written notice from the
relevant Lender, agrees to issue Notes to any Lender requiring Notes to facilitate transactions of the type described in paragraph (d) above. 
(f) No assignment or participation made or purported to be made to any Eligible Assignee or Participant shall be effective without the prior
written consent of the Borrower if it would require the Borrower to make any filing with any Governmental Authority or qualify any Loan or Note under the laws of any jurisdiction, in each case as a result of any such Eligible Assignee or Participant
electing to securitize obligations of such Eligible Assignee or Participant, as applicable, and the Borrower shall be entitled to request and receive such information and assurances as they may reasonably request from any such Eligible Assignee or
Participant to determine whether any such filing or qualification is required or whether any assignment or participation is otherwise in accordance with applicable law. 
11.7 Sharing of Payments; Set-off. (a) Except to the extent that this Agreement expressly provides for payments to be allocated to
a particular Lender, if any Lender (a Benefitted Lender) shall receive any payment of all or part of the Obligations owing to it, or receive any collateral in respect thereof (whether voluntarily or involuntarily, by set-off,
pursuant to events or proceedings of the nature referred to in Section 9.1(f), or otherwise), in a greater proportion than any such payment to or collateral received by any other Lender, if any, in respect of the Obligations owing to such other
Lender, such Benefitted Lender shall purchase for cash from the other Lenders a participating interest in such portion of the Obligations owing to each such other Lender, or shall provide such other Lenders with the benefits of any such collateral,
as shall be necessary to cause such Benefitted Lender to share the excess payment or benefits of such collateral ratably with each of the Lenders; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment or benefits is thereafter
recovered from such Benefitted Lender, such purchase or benefits shall be rescinded, and the purchase price and benefits returned, to the extent of such recovery, but without interest. 
  106 


(b) If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender and each of their
respective Affiliates who is owed Obligations is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, except to the extent prohibited by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any
time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender to or for the credit or the account of any Loan Party against any of and all the obligations of any Loan Party now or hereafter existing under this Agreement and other Loan Documents
held by such Lender, irrespective of whether or not such Lender or such Affiliate shall have made any demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and although such obligations of such Loan Party may be contingent or unmatured or are owed
to a branch, office or Affiliate of such Lender different from the branch, office or Affiliate holding such deposit or obligated on such indebtedness; provided that in the event that any Defaulting Lender shall exercise any such right of
setoff, (x) all amounts so set off shall be paid over immediately to the Administrative Agent for further application in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.2 and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender
from its other funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and (y) the Defaulting Lender shall provide promptly to the Administrative Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the
Obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as to which it exercised such right of setoff. The rights of each Lender and its Affiliates under this Section 11.7(b) are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff)
that such Lender or its Affiliates may have. Each Lender agrees to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent promptly after any such setoff and application made by the Lender; provided that the failure to give such notice shall not
affect the validity of such setoff and application.  11.8 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed by one or more of the
parties to this Agreement on any number of separate counterparts, and all of said counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same instrument. Delivery of an executed signature page of this Agreement by facsimile or other
electronic transmission (e.g., .pdf or tif format) shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart hereof. 
11.9 Severability. In the event any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document should be
held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein and therein shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby (it being understood that the invalidity
of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not in and of itself affect the validity of such provision in any other jurisdiction). The parties hereto shall endeavor in good-faith negotiations to replace the invalid, illegal or
unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions. 
11.10 Integration. This Agreement and the other Loan Documents represent the entire agreement of the Borrower, the other Loan Parties,
the Agents and the Lenders with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof and thereof. There are no promises,
undertakings, representations or warranties by any Agent or any Lender relative to the subject matter hereof not expressly set forth or referred to herein or therein. 
  107 


11.11 GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS AND ANY CLAIM,
CONTROVERSY, DISPUTE OR CAUSE OF ACTION (WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR TORT OR OTHERWISE) BASED UPON, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT (EXCEPT, AS TO ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT, AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH THEREIN) AND THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND THEREBY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REGARD TO CONFLICTS OF LAW RULES THAT WOULD RESULT IN THE APPLICATION OF A DIFFERENT
GOVERNING LAW.  11.12 Submission To Jurisdiction; Waivers. The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally: 
(a) submits for itself and its property in any legal action or proceeding relating to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which it
is a party, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect thereof, to the exclusive general jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York sitting in the Borough of Manhattan, the courts of the United States for the Southern
District of New York sitting in the Borough of Manhattan, and appellate courts from any thereof;  (b) consents that any such action or
proceeding may be brought in such courts and waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the venue of any such action or proceeding in any such court or that such action or proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not
to plead or claim the same;  (c) agrees that service of process in any such action or proceeding may be effected by mailing a copy thereof
by registered or certified mail (or any substantially similar form of mail), postage prepaid, to the Borrower at its address set forth in Section 11.2 or at such other address of which the Administrative Agent shall have been notified pursuant
thereto;  (d) agrees that nothing herein shall affect the right to effect service of process in any other manner permitted by law; and 
(e) waives, to the maximum extent not prohibited by law, any right it may have to claim or recover any special, exemplary, punitive or
consequential damages.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall affect any right that the Administrative
Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents against any Loan Party or their respective properties in the courts of any jurisdiction. 
11.13 No Fiduciary Duty. The Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, each Lender and their Affiliates (collectively, solely for
purposes of this paragraph, the Lenders), may have economic interests that conflict with those of the Loan Parties, their stockholders and/or their affiliates. Each Loan Party agrees that nothing in the Loan Documents or
otherwise will be deemed to create an advisory, fiduciary or agency relationship or fiduciary or other implied duty 
  108 



between any Lender, on the one hand, and such Loan Party, its stockholders or its affiliates, on the other. The Loan Parties acknowledge and agree that (i) the transactions contemplated
by the Loan Documents (including the exercise of rights and remedies hereunder and thereunder) are arms-length commercial transactions between the Lenders, on the one hand, and the Loan Parties, on the other, and (ii) in connection
therewith and with the process leading thereto, (x) no Lender has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of any Loan Party, its stockholders or its affiliates with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby (or the
exercise of rights or remedies with respect thereto) or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether any Lender has advised, is currently advising or will advise any Loan Party, its stockholders or its Affiliates on other matters) or any
other obligation to any Loan Party except the obligations expressly set forth in the Loan Documents and (y) each Lender is acting solely as principal and not as the agent or fiduciary of any Loan Party, its management, stockholders, creditors
or any other Person. Each Loan Party acknowledges and agrees that it has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate and that it is responsible for making its own independent judgment with respect to such
transactions and the process leading thereto. Each Loan Party agrees that it will not claim that any Lender has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to such Loan Party, in connection with such
transactions or the process leading thereto.  11.14 Releases of Guarantees and Liens. (a) Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein or in any other Loan Document, each of the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent is hereby irrevocably authorized by each Secured Party (without requirement of notice to or consent of any Secured Party except as
expressly required by Section 11.1) to take any action requested by the Borrower having the effect of releasing any Collateral or guarantee obligations (i) to the extent necessary to permit consummation of any transaction not prohibited by
any Loan Document (including, without limitation, the release of any Guarantor from its obligations if such Person ceases to be a Subsidiary of the Borrower or becomes an Excluded Subsidiary as a result of a transaction permitted hereunder) or that
has been consented to in accordance with Section 11.1 or (ii) under the circumstances described in paragraph (b) below; provided that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any other Loan Document, MineSet
shall only be released from its obligations as a Guarantor under the Loan Documents if (x) MineSet ceases to be a Subsidiary of the Borrower and (y) the Outstanding Amount of the Loans is less than $40,000,000. 
(b) At such time as the Discharge of the Obligations (as defined in the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement) has occurred, the Collateral shall
be released from the Liens created by the Security Documents, and the Security Documents and all obligations (other than those expressly stated to survive such termination) of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and each Loan Party under
the Security Documents (including the guarantee set forth therein) shall terminate, all without delivery of any instrument or performance of any act by any Person; provided, however, that the Collateral Agent shall execute and deliver
to the Borrower, at the Borrowers expense, all UCC termination statements, releases and similar documents reasonably requested by the Borrower to evidence such termination. 
11.15 Confidentiality. Each of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Lenders agrees to maintain the confidentiality of
the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its and its Affiliates officers, directors, employees and 
  109 



agents, including accountants, legal counsel, numbering, administration and settlement service providers and other advisors (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made
will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the extent requested or required by any regulatory authority or quasi-regulatory authority (such as the National
Association of Insurance Commissioners), (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or under the other Loan
Documents or any suit, action or proceeding relating to the enforcement of its rights hereunder or thereunder, (e) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as or no less restrictive than those of this
Section 11.15, to (i) any actual or prospective assignee of or participant in any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents or (ii) any actual or prospective counterparty (or its advisors) to any
swap or derivative transaction relating to the Borrower or any Subsidiary of the Borrower or any of their respective obligations, (f) on a confidential basis to (i) any rating agency in connection with rating the Borrower or its
Subsidiaries or the credit facilities provided hereunder, (g) with the consent of the Borrower or (h) to the extent such Information becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section 11.15.
Information shall mean all information received from the Borrower and related to the Borrower or its business, other than any such information that was available to the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender on a
non-confidential basis prior to its disclosure by the Borrower; provided that, in the case of Information received from the Borrower after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential. Any
Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section 11.15 shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the
confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord its own confidential information.  11.16 WAIVERS OF JURY TRIAL.
EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN
DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, BREACH OF DUTY, COMMON LAW, STATUTE OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER
PERSON HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PERSON WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION. EACH PARTY HERETO FURTHER REPRESENTS AND WARRANTS THAT IT HAS REVIEWED THIS WAIVER WITH ITS LEGAL COUNSEL AND THAT IT KNOWINGLY AND
VOLUNTARILY WAIVES IT JURY TRIAL RIGHTS FOLLOWING CONSULTATION WITH LEGAL COUNSEL. 
  110 


11.17 Patriot Act Notice. Each Lender and the Administrative Agent (for itself and not on
behalf of any Lender) hereby notifies the Loan Parties that pursuant to the requirements of the Patriot Act, it may be required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each Loan Party, which information includes the name and address
of such Loan Party and other information that will allow such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, to identify such Loan Party in accordance with the Patriot Act. 
11.18 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Nothing in this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, express or implied, shall be construed to
confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective permitted successors and assigns, the Indemnitees, Participants to the extent expressly contemplated hereby and Agent Related Parties) any legal or equitable right, remedy,
obligation, liability or claim under or by reason of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents.  11.19 Application of Proceeds.
The Administrative Agent shall apply any amounts received from the Collateral Agent pursuant to Section 6.4 of the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement or any other comparable provision of any other Security Document in the following order: 
(i) to the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent, to pay incurred and unpaid fees and expenses thereof under the Loan Documents; 
(ii) to the Lenders, to pay incurred and unpaid fees and expenses of the Lenders under the Loan Documents (the amounts so applied to be

(iii) to the Lenders, to pay any outstanding interest under the Loan Documents then due and owing and remaining unpaid (the amounts so applied
to be distributed among the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the amounts of the Obligations to be distributed pursuant to this clause (iii) owed to them on the date of any such distribution); 
(iv) to the Lenders, to pay all other Obligations under the Loan Documents then due and owing and remaining unpaid (the amounts so applied to

(v) to the Lenders, to prepay all other Obligations under the Loan Documents (the amounts so applied to be distributed among the Lenders pro
rata in accordance with the amounts of the Obligations to be distributed pursuant to this clause (v) owed to them on the date of any such distribution); and 
(vi) any balance of any such amounts remaining after application as described above shall be paid over to the Borrower or to whomsoever may be

2.1 Guarantee of Borrower Obligations. Each of the Guarantors hereby, jointly and severally, absolutely, unconditionally and
irrevocably, guarantees, as primary obligor and not merely as surety, to the Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties and their respective successors, indorsees, transferees and assigns, the prompt and complete payment and performance by each
other Guarantor, when due (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) of the Borrower Obligations. Each Guarantor shall be liable under its guarantee set forth in this Section 2.1, without any limitation as to amount, for all
present and future Borrower Obligations, including specifically all future increases in the outstanding amount of the Loans or other Borrower Obligations and other future increases in the Borrower Obligations, whether or not any such increase is
committed, contemplated or provided for by the Loan Documents, the Specified Cash Management Agreements or the Specified Hedge Agreements on the date hereof. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Guarantors liability shall
extend to all Borrower Obligations (including, without limitation, interest, fees, costs and expenses) that would be owed by any other obligor on the Borrower Obligations but for the fact that they are unenforceable against such other obligor or not
allowable due to the existence of an Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding involving such other obligor because it is the intention of the Guarantors and Secured Parties that the Borrower Obligations which are guaranteed by the Guarantors pursuant
hereto should be determined without regard to any rule of law or order which may relieve the Borrower or any Guarantor of any portion of such Borrower Obligations. 
2.2 Limitation on Borrower Obligations Guaranteed. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, the right of recovery against
each Guarantor under Section 2 hereof shall not exceed $1.00 less than the lowest amount which would render such Guarantors obligations under Section 2 hereof void or voidable under applicable law, including, without limitation, the
Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar foreign, federal or state law to the extent applicable to the guarantee set forth herein and the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder. To effectuate the foregoing
intention, the Agent and the Guarantors hereby irrevocably agree that the Borrower Obligations of each Guarantor under the guarantee set forth in Section 2 hereof at any time shall be limited to the maximum amount as

  14 



will result in the Borrower Obligations of such Guarantor under the guarantee set forth in Section 2 hereof not constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance after giving full effect to
the liability under the guarantee set forth in Section 2 hereof and its related contribution rights but before taking into account any liabilities under any other guarantee by such Guarantor. For purposes of the foregoing, all guarantees of
such Guarantor other than the guarantee under Section 2 hereof will be deemed to be enforceable and payable after the guarantee under Section 2 hereof. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, this Section 2.2(a) shall be
for the benefit solely of creditors and representatives of creditors of each Guarantor and not for the benefit of such Guarantor or the holders of any Equity Interest in such Guarantor. 
(b) Each Guarantor agrees that Borrower Obligations may at any time and from time to time be incurred or permitted in an amount exceeding the
maximum liability of such Guarantor under Section 2.2(a) without impairing the guarantee contained in this Section 2 or affecting the rights and remedies of any Secured Party hereunder. 
2.3 Nature of Guarantee; Continuing Guarantee; Waivers of Defenses Etc.. (a) Each Guarantor understands and agrees that the
guarantee contained in this Section 2 shall be construed as a continuing guarantee of payment and performance and not merely of collectability. Each Guarantor waives, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, diligence, presentment,
protest, demand for payment and notice of dishonor, default or nonpayment to or upon the Borrower or any of the other Guarantors with respect to the Borrower Obligations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, this guarantee and the
obligations of Guarantors hereunder and the Liens granted hereunder shall be valid and enforceable and shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment, setoff, defense, counterclaim, discharge or termination for any reason (other than
a defense of payment or performance).  (b) Each Guarantor agrees that the Borrower Obligations of each Guarantor hereunder are independent
of the Borrower Obligations of each other Guarantor or any other guarantee of the Borrower Obligations and when making any demand hereunder or otherwise pursuing its rights and remedies hereunder against any Guarantor, any Secured Party may, but
shall be under no obligation to, make a similar demand on or otherwise pursue such rights and remedies as it may have against the Borrower, any other Guarantor or any other Person or against any collateral security or guarantee for the Borrower
Obligations or any right of offset with respect thereto, and any failure by any Secured Party to make any such demand, to pursue such other rights or remedies or to collect any payments from the Borrower, any other Guarantor or any other Person or
to realize upon any such collateral security or guarantee or to exercise any such right of offset, or any release of the Borrower, any other Guarantor or any other Person or any such collateral security, guarantee or right of offset, shall not
relieve any Guarantor of any obligation or liability hereunder, and shall not impair or affect the rights and remedies, whether express, implied or available as a matter of law, of any Secured Party against any Guarantor. For the purposes hereof
demand shall include the commencement and continuance of any legal proceedings.  (c) No payment made by the Borrower, any of
the Guarantors, any other guarantor or any other Person or received or collected by any Secured Party from the Borrower, any of the Guarantors, any other guarantor or any other Person by virtue of any action or proceeding or any set-off or
appropriation or application at any time or from time to time in 
  15 



reduction of or in payment of the Borrower Obligations shall be deemed to modify, reduce, release or otherwise affect the liability of any Guarantor hereunder which shall, notwithstanding any
such payment (other than any payment made by such Guarantor in respect of the Borrower Obligations or any payment received or collected from such Guarantor in respect of any of the Obligations) remain liable for the Borrower Obligations until the
Discharge of the Obligations.  (d) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Guarantor and Grantor agrees that its
obligations under the guarantee contained in this Section 2, and any Lien granted hereunder, shall not be affected by, and shall remain in full force and effect without regard to, and hereby waives, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable
law, all rights, claims or defenses (other than a defense of payment or performance) that it might otherwise have (now or in the future) with respect to each of the following (whether or not such Guarantor has knowledge thereof): 
(i) the validity or enforceability of the Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document or any Specified Hedge Agreement or
Specified Cash Management Agreement, any of the Borrower Obligations or any guarantee or right of offset with respect thereto at any time or from time to time held by any Secured Party; 
(ii) any renewal, extension or acceleration of, or any increase in the amount of the Borrower Obligations, or any amendment,
supplement, modification or waiver of, or any consent to departure from, the Loan Documents or any Specified Hedge Agreement or Specified Cash Management Agreement; 
(iii) any failure or omission to assert or enforce or agreement or election not to assert or enforce, or the stay or
enjoining, by order of court, by operation of law or otherwise, of the exercise or enforcement of, any claim or demand or any right, power or remedy (whether arising under any Loan Documents, any Specified Hedge Agreement or any Specified Cash
Management Agreements, at law, in equity or otherwise) with respect to the Borrower Obligations or any agreement relating thereto, or with respect to any other guarantee of or security for the payment of the Borrower Obligations; 
(iv) any change, reorganization or termination of the corporate structure or existence of the Borrower or any Guarantor or any
of their Subsidiaries and any corresponding restructuring of the Borrower Obligations;  (v) settlement, compromise,
release, or discharge, or acceptance of or refusal of any offer of payment or performance with respect to, or substitutions for, the Borrower Obligations or subordination of the Borrower Obligations to any other obligations; 
(vi) any failure to perfect or maintain the perfection or priority of any security for the Borrower Obligations (including
without limitation, the Collateral) to the extent provided herein or any release of any or all such security; 
  16 


(vii) exercise remedies with respect to any security for the Borrower
Obligations (including, without limitation, the Collateral) at such time and in such order and in such manner as the Agent and the Secured Parties may decide and whether or not every aspect thereof is commercially reasonable and whether or not such
action constitutes an election of remedies and even if such action operates to impair or extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy that any Guarantor would otherwise have; and 
(viii) any other circumstance whatsoever which may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of any Guarantor or
Grantor as an obligor in respect of the Borrower Obligations or which constitutes, or might be construed to constitute, an equitable or legal discharge of the Borrower or any Guarantor or Grantor for the Borrower Obligations, or of such Guarantor
under the guarantee contained in this Section 2, whether in an Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding or in any other instance.  (e) In
addition each Guarantor further waives any and all other defenses, set-offs or counterclaims (other than a defense of payment or performance) which may at any time be available to or be asserted by it, the Borrower, any Guarantor or Person against
any Secured Party, including, without limitation, failure of consideration, breach of warranty, statute of frauds, statute of limitations, accord and satisfaction and usury. 
2.4 Rights of Reimbursement, Contribution and Subrogation. In case any payment is made on account of the Borrower Obligations by any
Guarantor or is received or collected on account of the Borrower Obligations from any Guarantor or its property:  (a) If such payment is
made by a Guarantor or from its property in respect of the Borrower Obligations of another Guarantor, such Guarantor shall be entitled, subject to and upon (but not before) a Discharge of the Obligations, (A) to demand and enforce reimbursement
for the full amount of such payment from such other Guarantor and (B) to demand and enforce contribution in respect of such payment from each other Guarantor which has not paid its fair share of such payment, as necessary to ensure that (after
giving effect to any enforcement of reimbursement rights provided hereby) each Guarantor pays its fair share of the unreimbursed portion of such payment. For this purpose, the fair share of each Guarantor as to any unreimbursed payment shall be
determined based on an equitable apportionment of such unreimbursed payment among all Guarantors based on the relative value of their assets and any other equitable considerations deemed appropriate by the court. For purposes of the foregoing, all
guarantees of any Guarantor other than the guarantee under Section 2 hereof will be deemed to be enforceable and payable after the guaranty under Section 2 hereof. 
(b) If and whenever (after Discharge of the Obligations) any right of reimbursement or contribution becomes enforceable by any Guarantor
against any other Guarantor whether under Sections 2.2(a) or otherwise, such Guarantor shall be entitled, subject to and upon Discharge of the Obligations, to be subrogated (equally and ratably with all other

  17 



Guarantors entitled to reimbursement or contribution from any other Guarantor as set forth in this Section 2.4) to any security interest that may then be held by the Agent upon any
Collateral granted to it in this Agreement. Any right of subrogation of any Guarantor shall be enforceable solely after a Discharge of the Obligations and solely against the Guarantors, and not against the Secured Parties, and neither the Agent nor
any other Secured Party shall have any duty whatsoever to warrant, ensure or protect any such right of subrogation or to obtain, perfect, maintain, hold, enforce or retain any Collateral for any purpose related to any such right of subrogation. If
subrogation is demanded by any Guarantor, then, after Discharge of the Obligations, the Agent shall deliver to the Guarantors making such demand, or to a representative of such Guarantor or of the Guarantors generally, an instrument satisfactory to
the Agent transferring, on a quitclaim basis without any recourse, representation, warranty or any other obligation whatsoever, whatever security interest the Agent then may hold in whatever Collateral may then exist that was not previously released
or disposed of or acquired by the Agent.  (c) All rights and claims arising under this Section 2.4 or based upon or relating to any
other right of reimbursement, indemnification, contribution or subrogation that may at any time arise or exist in favor of any Guarantor as to any payment on account of the Borrower Obligations made by it or received or collected from its property
shall be fully subordinated in all respects to the prior Discharge of the Obligations. Until Discharge of the Obligations, no Guarantor shall demand or receive any collateral security, payment or distribution whatsoever (whether in cash, property or
securities or otherwise) on account of any such right or claim. If any such payment or distribution is made or becomes available to any Guarantor in any bankruptcy case or receivership or insolvency or liquidation proceeding, such payment or
distribution shall be delivered by the person making such payment or distribution directly to the Agent, for application to the payment of the Borrower Obligations. If any such payment or distribution is received by any Guarantor, it shall be held
by such Guarantor in trust, as trustee of an express trust for the benefit of the Secured Parties, and shall forthwith be transferred and delivered by such Guarantor to the Agent, in the exact form received and, if necessary, duly endorsed. 
(d) The obligations of the Guarantors under the Loan Documents, including their liability for the Borrower Obligations and the enforceability
of the security interests granted thereby, are not contingent upon the validity, legality, enforceability, collectability or sufficiency of any right of reimbursement, contribution or subrogation arising under this Section 2.4. The invalidity,
insufficiency, unenforceability or uncollectability of any such right shall not in any respect diminish, affect or impair any such obligation or any other claim, interest, right or remedy at any time held by any Secured Party against any Guarantor
or its property. The Secured Parties make no representations or warranties in respect of any such right and shall have no duty to assure, protect, enforce or ensure any such right or otherwise relating to any such right. 
2.5 Payments. Each Guarantor hereby guarantees that payments hereunder will be paid to the Agent without setoff or counterclaim in
Dollars in immediately available funds at the office of the Agent located at the Funding Office specified in the Credit Agreement. 
  18 


2.6 Subordination of Other Obligations. Any Indebtedness of the Borrower or any Guarantor
now or hereafter held by any other Guarantor (the Obligee Guarantor) is hereby subordinated in right of payment to the Borrower Obligations, and any such Indebtedness collected or received by the Obligee Guarantor after an Event
of Default has occurred and is continuing shall be held in trust for the Agent on behalf of the Secured Parties and shall forthwith be paid over to the Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties to be credited and applied against the Borrower
Obligations but without affecting, impairing or limiting in any manner the liability of the Obligee Guarantor under any other provision hereof. 
2.7 Financial Condition of Borrowers and other Guarantors. The Loans may be made to the Borrower on the Closing Date or continued from
time to time and any Specified Hedge Agreements and Specified Cash Management Agreements may be entered into from time to time, in each case, without notice to or authorization from any Guarantor regardless of the financial or other condition of the
Borrower or any Guarantor at the time of any such grant or continuation or at the time such Specified Hedge Agreement or Specified Cash Management Agreement is entered into, as the case may be. No Secured Party shall have any obligation to disclose
or discuss with any Guarantor its assessment, or any Guarantors assessment, of the financial condition of the Borrower or any Guarantor. Each Guarantor hereby waives, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, and relinquishes any duty
on the part of any Secured Party to disclose any matter, fact or thing relating to the business, operations or condition of the Borrower or any Guarantor now known or hereafter known by any Secured Party. 
2.8 Duration of Guaranty, Discharge of Guaranty Upon Sale of Guarantor. (a) Except as provided in 2.8(b) below, the guarantee
contained in this Section 2 shall remain in full force and effect until the Discharge of the Obligations.  (b) If (i) any
Guarantor or any of its successors in interest hereunder ceases to be a Subsidiary of the Borrower or becomes an Excluded Subsidiary as a result of a transaction permitted by the Loan Documents, the guarantee of such Guarantor or such successor in
interest, as the case may be, hereunder shall automatically be discharged and released without any further action by any Secured Party or other Person effective as the time of such sale or disposition. 
2.9 Reinstatement. The guarantee contained in this Section 2 shall continue to be effective, or be reinstated, as the case may be,
if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any of the Borrower Obligations is rescinded, disgorged or must otherwise be restored or returned by any Secured Party upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or reorganization of the
Borrower or any Guarantor, or upon or as a result of the appointment of a receiver, intervenor or conservator of, or trustee or similar officer for, the Borrower or any Guarantor or any substantial part of its property, or otherwise, all as though
such payments had not been made. 
  19

 5.5 Investment Property. (a) If such Grantor shall become entitled to receive or shall receive any stock or other ownership
certificate (including, without limitation, any certificate representing a stock dividend or a distribution in connection with any reclassification, increase or reduction of capital or any certificate issued in connection with any reorganization),
option or rights in respect of the capital stock or other Pledged Equity Interest of any Issuer, whether in addition to, in substitution of, as a conversion of, or in exchange for, any shares of or other ownership interests in the Pledged Equity
Interests, or otherwise in respect thereof, such Grantor shall accept the same as the agent of the Secured Parties, hold the same in trust for the Secured Parties and deliver the same forthwith to the Agent substantially in the form received, duly
endorsed by such Grantor to the Agent together with an undated stock power covering such certificate duly executed in blank by such Grantor and, if the Agent so requests, signature guaranteed, to be held by the Agent, subject to the terms hereof, as
additional collateral security for the Obligations. Unless such liquidation or dissolution is otherwise permitted under the Credit Agreement and no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at such time, or would occur as a result of such
liquidation or dissolution, any sums paid upon or in respect of the Pledged Equity Interests upon the liquidation or dissolution of any Issuer shall be paid over to the Agent to be held by it hereunder as additional collateral security for the
Obligations, and in case any distribution of capital shall be made on or in respect of the Pledged Equity Interests or any property shall be distributed upon or with respect to the Pledged Equity Interests pursuant to the recapitalization or
reclassification of the capital of any Issuer or pursuant to the reorganization thereof, the property so distributed shall, unless otherwise subject to a perfected security interest in favor of the Agent, be delivered to the Agent to be held by it
hereunder as additional collateral security for the Obligations. Unless such liquidation or dissolution is otherwise permitted under the Credit Agreement and no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at such time, or would occur as a result
of such liquidation or dissolution, if any sums of money or property so paid or distributed in respect of the Pledged Equity Interests shall be received by such Grantor, such Grantor shall, until such money or property is paid or delivered to the
Agent, hold such money or property in trust for the Secured Parties, segregated from other funds of such Grantor, as additional collateral security for the Obligations. 
(b) Without the prior written consent of the Agent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, such Grantor will not (i) except as
permitted under the Credit Agreement, enter into any agreement or undertaking restricting the right or ability of such Grantor or the Agent to sell, assign or transfer any of the Investment Property or Proceeds

  28 



thereof or any interest therein or (ii) cause or permit any Issuer of any Pledged Partnership Interests or Pledged LLC Interests which are not securities (for purposes of the UCC) on the
date hereof to elect or otherwise take any action to cause such Pledged Partnership Interests or Pledged LLC Interests to be treated as securities for purposes of the UCC; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, if any
issuer of any Pledged Partnership Interests or Pledged LLC Interests takes any such action in violation of the foregoing in this clause (ii), such Grantor shall promptly notify the Agent in writing of any such election or action and, in such event,
use commercially reasonable efforts to take steps necessary or advisable to establish the Agents control thereof.  (c)
Each Grantor which is an Issuer, agrees that (i) it will be bound by the terms of this Agreement relating to the Pledged Equity Interests issued by it and will comply with such terms insofar as such terms are applicable to it, (ii) it will
notify the Agent promptly in writing of the occurrence of any of the events described in Section 5.5(a) with respect to the Pledged Equity Interests issued by it and (iii) the terms of Section 5.6(c) shall apply to it, mutatis
mutandis, with respect to all actions that may be required of it pursuant to Section 5.6(c) with respect to the Pledged Equity Interests issued by it. 
5.6 Voting and Other Rights with Respect to Pledged Securities. (a) Unless (x) an Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing or (y) the Loans were accelerated pursuant to Section 9.1 of the Credit Agreement, and, in the case of each of clauses (x) and (y), the Agent shall have given notice to the relevant Grantor of the Agents intent to
exercise its corresponding rights pursuant to Section 5.6(b), each Grantor shall be permitted to receive all cash dividends paid in respect of the Pledged Equity Interests and all payments made in respect of the Pledged Notes or Pledged Debt
Securities, to the extent permitted in the Credit Agreement, and to exercise all voting and corporate rights with respect to the Pledged Equity Interests; provided, however, that no vote shall be cast or corporate or other ownership
right exercised or other action taken which would materially and adversely impair the Collateral or which would result in any material violation of any provision of the Credit Agreement, this Agreement or any other Loan Document. 
(b) If (x) an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing or (y) the Loans have been accelerated pursuant to Section 9.1 of
the Credit Agreement, and, in the case of each of clauses (x) and (y), the Agent shall give notice of its intent to exercise such rights to the relevant Grantor or Grantors: (i) all rights of each Grantor to exercise or refrain from
exercising the voting and other consensual rights which it would otherwise be entitled to exercise pursuant hereto shall cease and all such rights shall thereupon become vested in the Agent who shall thereupon have the sole right, but shall be under
no obligation, to exercise or refrain from exercising such voting and other consensual rights and (ii) the Agent shall have the right, without notice to any Grantor, to transfer all or any portion of the Pledged Equity Interests to its name or
the name of its nominee or agent. In addition, the Agent shall have the right at any time, without notice to any Grantor, to exchange any certificates or instruments representing any Pledged Equity Interests for certificates or instruments of
smaller or larger denominations. In order to permit the Agent to exercise the voting and other consensual rights which it may be entitled to exercise pursuant hereto and to receive all dividends and other distributions which it may be entitled to
receive hereunder each Grantor shall promptly execute and deliver (or cause to be executed and delivered) to the Agent all proxies, dividend payment orders and other instruments as the Agent may from time to time reasonably request and each Grantor
acknowledges that the Agent may utilize the power of attorney set forth herein. 
  29 


(c) Each Grantor hereby authorizes and instructs each Issuer of any Pledged Equity Interest
pledged by such Grantor hereunder to (i) comply with any instruction received by it from the Agent in writing that (x) states that (1) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or (2) the Loans have been accelerated
pursuant to Section 9.1 of the Credit Agreement and (y) is otherwise in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, without any other or further instructions from such Grantor, and each Grantor agrees that each Issuer shall be fully
protected in so complying, and (ii) unless otherwise expressly permitted hereby, pay any dividends or other payments with respect to the Pledged Equity Interests directly to the Agent. 
5.7 Receivables. (a) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default and receipt of notice from the Agent
pursuant to this Section 5.7, no Grantor will (i) grant any extension of the time of payment of any Receivable required to be included in Collateral, (ii) compromise or settle any Receivable required to be included in Collateral for
less than the full amount thereof, (iii) release, wholly or partially, any Person liable for the payment of any Receivable required to be included in Collateral, (iv) allow any credit or discount whatsoever on any Receivable required to be
included in Collateral or (v) amend, supplement or modify any Receivable required to be included in Collateral; provided that notwithstanding any of the above, such extensions, compromises, settlements, releases, credits, discounts,
amendments, supplements or modifications shall be permitted if (A) they occur in the ordinary course of business, (B) they are otherwise permitted by the Loan Documents, or (C) they would not reasonably be expected to materially
adversely affect the value of the Receivable required to be included in Collateral taken as a whole.  (b) Other than in the ordinary
course of business consistent with its past practice or as could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, each Grantor shall perform and comply with all of its obligations with respect to the Receivables. 
5.8 Intellectual Property. (a) Such Grantor will not, (and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure its licensees will
not), without the prior written consent of the Agent, do any act or omit to do any act whereby any Material Intellectual Property owned by such Grantor may lapse, become abandoned, cancelled, dedicated to the public, forfeited, or otherwise
impaired, or abandon any application or any right to file an application for a Copyright, Patent, or Trademark constituting Material Intellectual Property owned by such Grantor, in each case, other than with respect to any Intellectual Property
which, in the reasonable judgment of such Grantor, is not of material value, or as to which the cost of maintaining such Intellectual Property exceeds the benefit thereof. 
(b) Such Grantor shall take all commercially reasonable steps, including in any proceeding before the United States Patent and Trademark
Office or the United States Copyright Office, as applicable, to pursue any application and maintain any registration or issuance of each Trademark, Patent, and Copyright owned by such Grantor (to the extent permitted by applicable law) and
constituting Material Intellectual Property, including, but not limited to, those applications and registrations listed on Schedule 6. 
  30 


(c) Such Grantor agrees that, (i) should it obtain an ownership interest in any item of
Intellectual Property, which is not now a part of the Collateral, (ii) should it (either by itself or through any agent, employee, licensee, or designee on such Grantors behalf) file any application for the registration or issuance of any
Intellectual Property with the United States Patent and Trademark Office or the United States Copyright Office, or (iii) should it file a Statement of Use or an Amendment to Allege Use with respect to any Intent-to-Use Application
(collectively, but excluding any Intent-to-Use Applications, the After-Acquired Intellectual Property), then the provisions of Section 3 shall automatically apply thereto, and any such After-Acquired Intellectual Property
shall automatically become part of the Collateral, and, with respect to any such After-Acquired Intellectual Property registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office or the United States Copyright Office (other than unpublished Patent
applications), it shall give written notice thereof to the Agent in accordance with Section 7.2(a) of the Credit Agreement, and it shall provide the Agent promptly in accordance with Section 7.2(a) of the Credit Agreement with an amended
listing of such Intellectual Property, which shall automatically be deemed to supplement Schedule 6 hereto, and promptly take the actions specified in 5.8(d) with respect thereto. 
(d) Such Grantor agrees to execute Intellectual Property Security Agreements with respect to any United States issued Patents and Patent
applications, any United States registered Trademarks and applications for the registration of United States Trademarks (except any Intent-to-Use Applications), any United States registered Copyrights and applications to register United States
Copyrights (collectively, Perfected IP), in each case, included in the Collateral as of the date hereof, as well as any Perfected IP constituting After-Acquired Intellectual Property, in substantially the form of Exhibits C-1,
C-2, and C-3 in order to record the security interest granted herein to the Agent for the ratable benefit of the Secured Parties with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and the United States Copyright Office, as applicable, and such
Grantor shall promptly after delivery of the written notice described in Section 5.8(c) above, execute and deliver, and have recorded, any and all other agreements, instruments, documents, and papers as the Agent may reasonably request to
evidence the Secured Parties security interest in any such Intellectual Property with any other applicable offices, agencies, or Governmental Authorities within the United States. 
(e) Such Grantor shall promptly notify the Agent if it knows that any Patent (other than unpublished Patent applications), Trademark or
Copyright that is Material Intellectual Property owned by such Grantor may become (i) abandoned or dedicated to the public or placed in the public domain, (ii) invalid or unenforceable, (iii) subject to any adverse determination or
development regarding such Grantors ownership, registration or use or the validity or enforceability of such Patent, Trademark or Copyright (including the institution of, or any adverse development with respect to, any action or proceeding in
the United States Patent and Trademark Office, the United States Copyright Office, any state registry, any foreign counterpart of the foregoing, or any court, but excluding office actions in the ordinary course of patent prosecution with the United
States Patent and Trademark Office) or (iv) the subject of any reversion or termination rights.  (f) Such Grantor will (and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that its li

 with the use of any of its owned or exclusively licensed Material Intellectual Property. 
  31 


(g) In the event that any Material Intellectual Property owned by or exclusively licensed to any
Grantor is infringed, misappropriated, diluted or otherwise violated by another Person, such Grantor shall promptly take actions that it considers reasonable under the circumstances to stop such infringement, misappropriation, dilution or other

steps as it determines necessary in its reasonable business judgment to protect the secrecy of all Trade Secrets constituting Material Intellectual Property, including, without limitation, entering into confidentiality agreements with employees and
consultants and labeling and restricting access to secret information and documents.  SECTION 6. REMEDIAL PROVISIONS 
6.1 Certain Matters Relating to Receivables. (a) Upon the Agents request but no more frequently than once per calendar year
(or if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, at any time), and at the expense of the relevant Grantor, such Grantor shall furnish to the Agent reports showing reconciliations and aging of, and trial balances for, its material
Receivables.  (b) The Agent hereby authorizes each Grantor to collect such Grantors Receivables and each Grantor hereby agrees to
continue to collect all amounts due or to become due to such Grantor under the Receivables and any Supporting Obligation and diligently exercise each material right it may have under any Receivable and any Supporting Obligation, in each case, at its
own expense consistent with its reasonable business judgment; provided, however, that the Agent may curtail or terminate said authority upon delivery or written notice to such Grantor at any time after the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default. If required by the Agent at any time after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, any payments of Receivables, when collected by any Grantor, (i) shall be forthwith (and, in any
event, within three Business Days of receipt by such Grantor) deposited by such Grantor in the exact form received, duly endorsed by such Grantor to the Agent if required, in a Collateral Account maintained under the sole dominion and control of the
Agent, subject to withdrawal by the Agent for the account of the Secured Parties only as provided in Section 6.4, and (ii) until so turned over, shall be held by such Grantor in trust for the Secured Parties, segregated from other funds of
such Grantor. Upon the written request of the Agent, the Borrower shall deliver to the Agent a report identifying in reasonable detail the nature and source of the payments included in any such deposit. 
(c) If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, at the Agents request, each Grantor shall deliver to the Agent all original
and other documents evidencing, and relating to, the agreements and transactions which gave rise to the Receivables, including, without limitation, all original orders, invoices and shipping receipts. 
  32 


6.2 Communications with Obligors; Grantors Remain Liable. (a) The Agent in its own
name or in the name of others may at any time after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default communicate with obligors under the Receivables and parties to the Contracts to verify with them to the Agents satisfaction
the existence, amount and terms of any Receivables or Contracts.  (b) At any time after the occurrence and during the continuance of an
Event of Default, the Agent may (and each Grantor at the request of the Agent shall) notify obligors on the Receivables and parties to the Contracts that the Receivables and the Contracts have been assigned to the Agent for the benefit of the
Secured Parties and that payments in respect thereof shall be made directly to the Agent.  (c) Anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding, each Grantor shall remain liable under each of such Grantors Receivables and Contracts to observe and perform in all material respects the conditions and obligations to be observed and performed by it thereunder, all in
accordance with the terms of any agreement giving rise thereto. Neither the Agent no any other Secured Party shall have any obligation or liability under any Receivable (or any agreement giving rise thereto) or Contract by reason of or arising out
of this Agreement or the receipt by any Secured Party of any payment relating thereto, nor shall any Secured Party be obligated in any manner to perform any of the obligations of any Grantor under or pursuant to any Receivable (or any agreement
giving rise thereto) or Contract, to make any payment, to make any inquiry as to the nature or the sufficiency of any payment received by it or as to the sufficiency of any performance by any party thereunder, to present or file any claim, to take
any action to enforce any performance or to collect the payment of any amounts which may have been assigned to it or to which it may be entitled at any time or time 
6.3 Proceeds to be Turned Over To Agent. In addition to the rights of the Secured Parties specified in Section 6.1 with respect to
payments of Receivables, if an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing and the Agent has instructed any Grantor to do so, all Proceeds received by such Grantor consisting of cash, Cash Equivalents, checks and other near-cash items shall be
held by such Grantor in trust for the Secured Parties, segregated from other funds of such Grantor, and shall, forthwith upon receipt by such Grantor, be turned over to the Agent substantially in the form received by such Grantor (duly endorsed by
such Grantor to the Agent, if required). All Proceeds received by the Agent hereunder shall be held by the Agent in a Collateral Account maintained under its sole dominion and control. All Proceeds while held by the Agent in a Collateral Account (or
by such Grantor in trust for the Secured Parties) shall continue to be held as collateral security for all the Obligations and shall not constitute payment thereof until applied as provided in Section 6.4. 
6.4 Application of Proceeds. At such intervals as may be agreed upon by the Borrower and the Agent, or, if an Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing, at any time at the Agents election, the Agent may (and, if directed by the Controlling Parties, shall), notwithstanding the provisions of Section 4.2 of the Credit Agreement, apply all or any part of the
Collateral and/or net Proceeds thereof (after deducting fees and expenses as provided in Section 6.5) realized through the exercise by the Agent of its remedies hereunder, whether or not held in any Collateral Account, any Securities Account or
any Deposit Account, and any proceeds of the guarantee set forth in Section 2, in payment of the Obligations. The Agent shall 
  33 



apply any such Collateral or Proceeds thereof to be applied in the order set forth in Section 11.19 of the Credit Agreement. Any Proceeds not applied shall be held by the Agent as
Collateral. In addition, with respect to any proceeds of Insurance received by the Agent, (x) if no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, such Insurance Proceeds shall be returned to the Grantors if permitted or required by
the Credit Agreement and (y) if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, then such Insurance Proceeds shall be held as Collateral. 
6.5 Code and Other Remedies. (a) If an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, the Agent, on behalf of the Secured Parties,
may exercise, in addition to all other rights and remedies granted to them in this Agreement and in any other instrument or agreement securing, evidencing or relating to the Obligations, all rights and remedies of a secured party under the UCC
(whether or not the UCC applies to the affected Collateral) and its rights under any other applicable law or in equity. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, the Agent, without demand
of performance or other demand, defense, presentment, protest, advertisement or notice of any kind (except any notice required by this Agreement or required by law referred to below) to or upon any Grantor or any other Person (all and each of which
demands, presentments, protests, defenses, advertisements and notices are hereby waived), may in such circumstances forthwith collect, receive, appropriate and realize upon the Collateral, or any part thereof, and/or may, subject to pre-existing
third-party rights and licenses, forthwith sell, lease, license, assign, give option or options to purchase, or otherwise dispose of and deliver the Collateral or any part thereof (or contract to do any of the foregoing), in one or more parcels at
public or private sale or sales, at any exchange, brokers board or office of any Secured Party, on the internet or elsewhere upon such terms and conditions as it may deem advisable and at such prices as it may deem best, for cash or on credit
or for future delivery without assumption of any credit risk. The Agent may store, repair or recondition any Collateral or otherwise prepare any Collateral for disposal in the manner and to the extent that the Agent deems appropriate. Each Secured
Party shall have the right upon any such public sale or sales, and, to the extent permitted by law, upon any such private sale or sales, to purchase the whole or any part of the Collateral so sold, free of any right or equity of redemption in any
Grantor, which right or equity is hereby waived and released. For purposes of bidding and making settlement or payment of the purchase price for all or a portion of the Collateral sold at any such sale made in accordance with the UCC, the Agent
shall be entitled to use and apply any of the Obligations on a pro rata basis as a credit on account of the purchase price for any Collateral payable by the Agent at such sale. Each purchaser at any such sale shall hold the property sold absolutely
free from any claim or right on the part of any Grantor, and each Grantor hereby waives (to the extent permitted by applicable law) all rights of redemption, stay and/or appraisal which it now has or may at any time in the future have under any rule
of law or statute now existing or hereafter enacted. Each Grantor agrees that, to the extent notice of sale shall be required by law, at least ten (10) days notice to such Grantor of the time and place of any public sale or the time after
which any private sale is to be made shall constitute reasonable notification. The Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale of Collateral regardless of notice of sale having been given. The Agent may adjourn any public or private sale from time
to time by announcement at the time and place fixed therefor, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which it was so adjourned. The Agent may sell the Collateral without giving any warranties as to the
Collateral. The Agent may specifically disclaim or modify any warranties of title or the like. The foregoing will not be considered to adversely affect the commercial reasonableness of any sale of the Collateral. Each 
  34 



Grantor hereby waives any claims against the Agent arising by reason of the fact that the price at which any Collateral may have been sold at such a private sale was less than the price which
might have been obtained at a public sale, even if the Agent accepts the first offer received and does not offer such Collateral to more than one offeree. Each Grantor further agrees, at the Agents request, to assemble the Collateral and make
it available to the Agent at places which the Agent shall reasonably select, whether at such Grantors premises or elsewhere. The Agent shall have the right to enter onto the property where any Collateral is located without any obligation to
pay rent and take possession thereof with or without judicial process. The Agent shall have no obligation to marshal any of the Collateral. 
(b) The Agent shall deduct from such Proceeds all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of every kind incurred in connection therewith
or incidental to the care or safekeeping of any of the Collateral or in any way relating to the Collateral or the rights of the Secured Parties hereunder, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements. Any net
Proceeds remaining after such deductions shall be applied or retained by the Agent in accordance with Section 6.4.  6.6
Intellectual Property.  (a) At any time after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default: (i) upon the
written demand of the Agent, each Grantor shall execute and deliver to the Agent an assignment or assignments, in favor of the Agent or its designee, of such Grantors rights, title, and interests in, to and under the Intellectual Property
included in the Collateral in recordable form as applicable, and such other documents as are necessary or appropriate to carry out the intent and purposes hereof and (ii) within five (5) Business Days of written notice from the Agent, each
Grantor shall make available to the Agent, to the extent within such Grantors power and authority, such personnel in such Grantors employ on the date of the Event of Default as the Agent may reasonably designate to permit such Grantor or
the Agent to continue, directly or indirectly, to produce, advertise, and sell the products and services sold by such Grantor under such Intellectual Property, and such persons shall be available to perform their prior functions on the Agents
behalf, at Grantors expense.  (b) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, the Agent shall have the
right, but shall in no way be obligated, to file applications for protection of the Intellectual Property included in the Collateral and/or bring suit in the name of any Grantor, the Agent or the Secured Parties, to enforce the Intellectual Property
included in the Collateral. In the event of such suit, each Grantor shall, at the request of the Agent, do any and all lawful acts, including joinder as a party, and execute any and all documents requested by the Agent in aid of such enforcement,
and the Grantors shall promptly reimburse and indemnify the Agent for all costs and expenses incurred by the Agent in the exercise of its rights under this clause (b). In the event that the Agent shall elect not to bring suit to enforce the
Intellectual Property included in the Collateral, each Grantor agrees, at the request of the Agent, to take all actions necessary, whether by suit, proceeding or other action, to prevent and/or obtain a recovery for the infringement or other
violation of rights in, diminution in value of, or other damage to any of the Intellectual Property included in the Collateral by any Person. 
  35 


(c) In the event of any Disposition of any of the Intellectual Property, the goodwill of the
business connected with and symbolized by any Trademarks subject to such Disposition shall be included, and, to the extent required under applicable law, the applicable Grantor shall supply the Agent or its designee with (i) copies of such
Grantors documents and things embodying such Grantors know-how and expertise, relating to the exploitation of such Intellectual Property, including the manufacture, distribution, advertising and sale of products or the provision of
services under such Intellectual Property, and (ii) copies of such Grantors customer lists and other records and documents relating to such Intellectual Property and to the manufacture, distribution, advertising and sale of such products
and services.  (d) Solely for the purpose of enabling Agent to exercise rights and remedies under this Section 6 (including in order
to take possession of, collect, receive, assemble, process, appropriate, operate, utilize, remove, realize upon, sell, assign, license out, convey, transfer or grant options to purchase any Collateral) at such time as Agent shall be lawfully
entitled to exercise such rights and remedies, each Grantor hereby grants to Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, (i) an irrevocable, nonexclusive, and assignable license and sublicense (exercisable without payment of royalty or other
compensation to any Grantor), subject, in the case of Trademarks, to sufficient rights to quality control and inspection in favor of such Grantor reasonably necessary to avoid the risk of invalidation of such Trademarks, to make, have made, use
sell, copy, distribute, perform, make derivative works, publish, practice, and exploit in any other manner for which an authorization from the owner of such Intellectual Property would be required under applicable Requirements of Law, with rights to
sublicense (through multiple tiers) any and all Intellectual Property now or hereafter owned by or licensed to such Grantor (which license shall include access to all media in which any of the licensed items may be recorded or stored and to all
software and programs used for the compilation or printout thereof) and (ii) an irrevocable license (without payment of rent or other compensation to such Grantor) to use, operate and occupy all real property owned, operated, leased, subleased,
or otherwise occupied by such Grantor. Any sublicenses duly granted by Agent under the foregoing grant of license or sublicense of Intellectual Property shall survive in accordance with their terms, notwithstanding the subsequent cure of any Event
of Default that gave rise to the exercise of the Agents rights and remedies hereunder; provided, that use of any such Intellectual Property by the Agent pursuant to any such sublicense shall be exercised by the Agent only upon the occurrence
and during the continuation of an Event of Default.  6.7 Effect of Securities Laws. (a) Each Grantor recognizes that the Agent
may be unable to effect a public sale of any or all the Pledged Equity Interests or the Pledged Debt Securities by reason of certain prohibitions contained in the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws or otherwise, and may be compelled
to resort to one or more private sales thereof to a restricted group of purchasers which will be obliged to agree, among other things, to acquire such securities for their own account for investment and not with a view to the distribution or resale
thereof. Each Grantor acknowledges and agrees that any such private sale may result in prices and other terms less favorable than if such sale were a public sale and, notwithstanding such circumstances, agrees that any such private sale shall be
deemed to have been made in a commercially reasonable manner. The Agent shall be under no obligation to delay a sale of any of the Pledged Equity Interests or the Pledged Debt Securities for the period of time necessary to permit the Issuer thereof
to register such securities for public sale under the Securities Act, or under applicable state securities laws, even if such Issuer would agree to do so. No Grantor, Issuer or other Person shall be required to register or otherwise qualify or
exempt such Pledged Equity Interests or the Pledged Debt Securities so as to permit a public sale. 
  36 


(b) Each Grantor agrees to use its best efforts to do or cause to be done all such other acts as
may be necessary to make such sale or sales of all or any portion of the Pledged Equity Interests or the Pledged Debt Securities pursuant to this Section 6.7 valid and binding and in compliance with any and all other applicable Requirements of
Law. Each Grantor further agrees that a breach of any of the covenants contained in this Section 6.7 will cause irreparable injury to the Secured Parties, that the Secured Parties have no adequate remedy at law in respect of such breach and, as
a consequence, that each and every covenant contained in this Section 6.7 shall be specifically enforceable against such Grantor, and such Grantor hereby waives and agrees not to assert any defenses against an action for specific performance of
such covenants except for a defense that no Event of Default has occurred or a defense of payment.  6.8 Deficiency. Each Grantor
shall remain liable for any deficiency if the proceeds of any sale or other disposition of the Collateral are insufficient to pay its Obligations and the fees and disbursements of any attorneys employed by any Secured Party to collect such
deficiency.  SECTION 7. POWER OF ATTORNEY AND FURTHER ASSURANCES 
7.1 Agents Appointment as Attorney-in-Fact, etc. (a) Each Grantor hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints the Agent and
any officer or agent thereof, with full power of substitution, as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full irrevocable power and authority in the place and stead of such Grantor and in the name of such Grantor or in its own name, for the
purpose of carrying out the terms of this Agreement, to take any and all appropriate action and to execute any and all documents and instruments which may be necessary or desirable to accomplish the purposes of this Agreement, and, without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, each Grantor hereby gives the Agent the power and right, on behalf of such Grantor, without notice to or assent by such Grantor, to do any or all of the following: 
(i) in the name of such Grantor or its own name, or otherwise, take possession of and endorse and collect any checks, drafts,
notes, acceptances or other instruments for the payment of moneys due under any Receivable required to be included in Collateral hereunder or with respect to any other Collateral and file any claim or take any other action or proceeding in any court
of law or equity or otherwise deemed appropriate by the Agent for the purpose of collecting any and all such moneys due under any Receivable or with respect to any other Collateral whenever payable; 
(ii) except with respect to the Specified IP Assets, in the case of any Intellectual Property, execute and deliver, and have
recorded, any and all agreements, instruments, documents and papers as the Agent may request to evidence the Secured Parties security interest in such Intellectual Property and the goodwill and general intangibles of such Grantor relating
thereto or represented thereby; 
  37 


(iii) pay or discharge taxes and Liens levied or placed on or threatened against
the Collateral, effect any repairs or purchase any insurance called for by the terms of the Loan Documents and pay all or any part of the premiums therefor and the costs thereof; 
(iv) execute, in connection with any sale provided for in Section 6.5 or 6.6, any endorsements, assignments or other
instruments of conveyance or transfer with respect to the Collateral;  (v) (1) direct any party liable for any
payment under any of the Collateral to make payment of any and all moneys due or to become due thereunder directly to the Agent or as the Agent shall direct; (2) ask or demand for, collect, and receive payment of and receipt for, any and all
moneys, claims and other amounts due or to become due at any time in respect of or arising out of any Collateral; (3) sign and endorse any invoices, freight or express bills, bills of lading, storage or warehouse receipts, drafts against
debtors, assignments, verifications, notices and other documents in connection with any of the Collateral; (4) commence and prosecute any suits, actions or proceedings at law or in equity in any court of competent jurisdiction to collect the
Collateral or any portion thereof and to enforce any other right in respect of any Collateral; (5) defend any suit, action or proceeding brought against such Grantor with respect to any Collateral; (6) settle, compromise or adjust any such
suit, action or proceeding and, in connection therewith, give such discharges or releases as the Agent may deem appropriate; (7) subject to preexisting third-party rights and licenses, assign any Copyright, Patent or Trademark owned by such
Grantor (along with the goodwill of the business to which any such Copyright, Patent or Trademark pertains), throughout the world for such term or terms, on such conditions, and in such manner, as the Agent shall in its reasonable discretion
determine; and (8) generally, but subject to preexisting third-party rights and licenses, sell, transfer, pledge and make any agreement with respect to or otherwise deal with any of the Collateral as fully and completely as though the Agent
were the absolute owner thereof for all purposes, and do, at the Agents option and such Grantors expense, at any time, or from time to time, all acts and things which the Agent reasonably deems necessary to protect, preserve or realize
upon the Collateral and the Secured Parties security interests therein and to effect the intent of this Agreement, all as fully and effectively as such Grantor might do; and 
(vi) to do all other acts and things necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, as fully and completely as though
the Agent were the absolute owner of the Collateral for all purposes;  provided, however, that nothing herein contained shall be construed
as requiring or obligating the Agent or any other Secured Party to make any commitment or to make any inquiry as to the nature or sufficiency of any payment received by the Agent or any other Secured Party, or to present or file any claim or notice,
or to take any action with respect to the Collateral or any part thereof or the moneys due or to become due in respect thereof or any property covered thereby, 
  38 



and no action taken or omitted to be taken by the Agent or any other Secured Party with respect to the Collateral or any part thereof shall give rise to any defense, counterclaim or offset in
favor of any Grantor or to any claim or action against the Agent or any other Secured Party. It is understood and agreed that the appointment of the Agent as the agent and attorney-in-fact of the Grantors for the purposes set forth above is coupled
with an interest and is irrevocable. The provisions of this Section shall in no event relieve any Grantor of any of its obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document with respect to the Collateral or any part thereof or impose any
obligation on the Agent or any other Secured Party to proceed in any particular manner with respect to the Collateral or any part thereof, or in any way limit the exercise by the Agent or any other Secured Party of any other or further right which
it may have on the date of this Agreement or hereafter, whether hereunder, under any other Loan Document, by law or otherwise. Anything in this Section 7.1(a) to the contrary notwithstanding, the Agent agrees that it will not exercise any
rights under the power of attorney provided for in this Section 7.1(a) unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing. 
(b) The reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Agent incurred in connection with actions undertaken as provided in this Section 7.1,
together with interest thereon at a rate per annum equal to the rate per annum at which interest would then be payable on past due Base Rate Loans under the Credit Agreement, from the date of payment by the Agent to the date reimbursed by the
relevant Grantor, shall be payable by such Grantor to the Agent on demand.  (c) Each Grantor hereby ratifies all that said attorneys shall
lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue hereof. All powers, authorizations and agencies contained in this Agreement are coupled with an interest and are irrevocable until this Agreement is terminated and the security interests created hereby are
released.  7.2 Authorization of Financing Statements. Each Grantor acknowledges that pursuant to Section 9-509(b) of the UCC
and any other applicable law, the Agent is authorized to file or record financing or continuation statements, and amendments thereto, and other filing or recording documents or instruments with respect to the Collateral in such form and in such
offices as the Agent reasonably determines appropriate to perfect or maintain the perfection of the security interests of the Agent under this Agreement to the extent provided herein. Each Grantor agrees that such financing statements may describe
the collateral in the same manner as described in the Security Documents or as all assets or all personal property of the such Grantor, whether now owned or hereafter existing or acquired by such Grantor or such other
description as the Agent, in its sole judgment, determines is necessary or advisable. A photographic or other reproduction of this Agreement shall be sufficient as a financing statement or other filing or recording document or instrument for filing
or recording in any jurisdiction. Each Grantor hereby ratifies and authorizes the filing by the Agent of any financing statement with respect to the Collateral made prior to the date hereof. 
  39 


7.3 Further Assurances. Each Grantor agrees that from time to time, at the expense of such
Grantor, it shall promptly execute and deliver all further instruments and documents and take all further action that may be necessary or desirable or that the Agent may reasonably request in order to create and/or maintain the validity, perfection
or priority of and protect any security interest granted or purported to be granted hereby or to enable the Agent to exercise and enforce its rights and remedies hereunder in respect of any Collateral. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, each Grantor shall, upon request of the Agent:  (i) except with respect to the Specified Assets, file such
financing or continuation statements, or amendments thereto, record security interests in Intellectual Property and execute and deliver such other agreements, instruments, endorsements, powers of attorney or notices, as may be necessary or
desirable, or as the Agent may reasonably request, in order to effect, reflect, perfect and preserve the security interests granted or purported to be granted hereby; 
(ii) take all actions necessary to ensure the recordation of appropriate evidence of the liens and security interest granted
hereunder in any Intellectual Property with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, the United States Copyright Office and the various Secretaries of State. For the avoidance of doubt, no Grantor shall be required to take any action in order
to perfect a security interest in any Specified IP Asset;  (iii) if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing,
upon request by the Agent, assemble the Collateral and allow inspection of the Collateral by the Agent or persons designated by the Agent; 
(iv) at the Agents reasonable request, appear in and defend any action or proceeding that may affect such Grantors
title to or the Agents interest in all or any part of the Collateral; and  (v) furnish the Agent with such
information regarding the Collateral, including, without limitation, the location thereof, as the Agent may reasonably request from time to time. 
SECTION 8. THE COLLATERAL AGENT 
8.1 Authority of Agent. (a) Each Grantor acknowledges that the rights and responsibilities of the Agent under this Agreement with
respect to any action taken by the Agent or the exercise or non-exercise by the Agent of any option, voting right, request, judgment or other right or remedy provided for herein or resulting or arising out of this Agreement shall, as between the
Agent and the other Secured Parties, be governed by the Credit Agreement and by such other agreements with respect thereto as may exist from time to time among them, but, as between the Agent and the Grantors, the Agent shall be conclusively
presumed to be acting as agent for the Secured Parties with full and valid authority so to act or refrain from acting, and no Grantor shall be under any obligation, or entitlement, to make any inquiry respecting such authority. 
(b) The Agent has been appointed to act as Agent hereunder by the Lenders and, by their acceptance of the benefits hereof, the other Secured
Parties. The Agent shall be obligated, and shall have the right hereunder, to make demands, to give notices, to exercise or refrain from exercising any rights, and to take or refrain from taking any action (including, without limitation, the release
or substitution of Collateral), solely in accordance with 
  40 



this Agreement and the Credit Agreement; provided that the Agent shall, after the termination of all Commitments and the payment in full of all Obligations (other than Unasserted
Contingent Obligations) under the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents (the Discharge of Credit Agreement Obligations), exercise, or refrain from exercising, any remedies provided for herein and otherwise act in
accordance with the instructions of the holders of a majority (the Majority Holders) of the sum of (x) the aggregate settlement or termination amount (exclusive of expenses and similar payments but including any early
termination payments then due) under all Specified Hedge Agreements and (y) all amounts payable under Specified Cash Management Agreements (exclusive of expenses and similar payments). For purposes of the foregoing sentence, the settlement or
termination value for any hedge that has not been terminated or closed out at the time of the relevant determination shall be a termination, close-out unwind or equivalent value as calculated by the appropriate swap counterparties and reported to
the Agent upon request or, if any such counterparty does not provide such calculation, such value as shall be determined by the Agent in its sole discretion; provided that any Specified Hedge Agreement with a termination or close-out amount
that is a negative number shall be disregarded for purposes of determining the Majority Holders. In furtherance of the foregoing provisions of this Section 8.1, each Secured Party, by its acceptance of the benefits hereof, agrees that it shall
have no right individually to realize upon any of the Collateral hereunder, it being understood and agreed by such Secured Party that all rights and remedies hereunder may be exercised solely by the Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties in
accordance with the terms of this Section 8.1. The provisions of the Credit Agreement relating to the Agent, including, without limitation, the provisions relating to resignation or removal of the Agent and the powers and duties and immunities
of the Agent, are incorporated herein by this reference and shall survive any termination of the Credit Agreement. To the extent permitted by applicable law, each Secured Party authorizes the Agent to credit bid all or any part of the Obligations
held by it.  8.2 Duty of Agent. The Agents sole duty with respect to the custody, safekeeping and physical preservation of the
Collateral in its possession, under Section 9-207 of the UCC or otherwise, shall be to deal with it in the same manner as the Agent deals with similar property for its own account. Neither the Agent nor any other Secured Party nor any of their
respective officers, directors, partners, employees, agents, attorneys or other advisors, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates shall be liable for failure to demand, collect or realize upon any of the Collateral or for any delay in doing so or shall be
under any obligation to sell or otherwise dispose of any Collateral upon the request of any Grantor or any other Person or to take any other action whatsoever with regard to the Collateral or any part thereof. The powers conferred on the Secured
Parties hereunder are solely to protect the Secured Parties interests in the Collateral and shall not impose any duty upon any Secured Party to exercise any such powers. The Secured Parties shall be accountable only for amounts that they
actually receive as a result of the exercise of such powers, and neither they nor any of their officers, directors, partners, employees, agents, attorneys and other advisors, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates shall be responsible to any Grantor for
any act or failure to act hereunder, except, in the case of the Agent only in respect of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct, to the extent required by applicable law. 
8.3 Exculpation of the Agent. (a) The Agent shall not be responsible to any Secured Party for the execution, effectiveness,
genuineness, validity, enforceability, collectability or sufficiency hereof or of any Security Document or the validity or perfection of 
  41 



any security interest or for any representations, warranties, recitals or statements made herein or therein or made in any written or oral statements or in any financial or other statements,
instruments, reports or certificates or any other documents furnished or made by the Agent to the Secured Parties or by or on behalf of any Secured Party to the Agent or any Secured Party in connection with the Security Documents and the
transactions contemplated thereby or for the financial condition or business affairs of any Loan Party or any other Person liable for the payment of any Obligations, nor shall the Agent be required to ascertain or inquire as to the performance or
observance of any of the terms, conditions, provisions, covenants or agreements contained in any of the Security Documents or as to the existence or possible existence of any Event of Default or Default or to make any disclosures with respect to the
foregoing.  (b) Neither the Agent nor any of its officers, partners, directors, employees or agents shall be liable to the Secured Parties
for any action taken or omitted by the Agent under or in connection with any of the Security Documents, except to the extent that any such act or failure to act is found by a final and nonappealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to
have resulted solely and proximately from their own gross negligence or willful misconduct in breach of a duty owed to the Secured Parties. The Agent shall be entitled to refrain from any act or the taking of any action (including the failure to
take an action) in connection herewith or any of the Security Documents or from the exercise of any power, discretion or authority vested in it hereunder or thereunder unless and until the Agent shall have been instructed in respect thereof by the
Controlling Parties and, upon such instruction, the Agent shall be entitled to act or (where so instructed) refrain from acting, or to exercise such power, discretion or authority, in accordance with such written instructions. Without prejudice to
the generality of the foregoing, (i) the Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any communication, instrument or document believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed or sent by the
proper Person or Persons, and shall be entitled to rely and shall be protected in relying on opinions and judgments of attorneys (who may be attorneys for the Borrower and their Subsidiaries), accountants, experts and other professional advisors
selected by it, and (ii) no Secured Party shall have any right of action whatsoever against the Agent as a result of the Agent acting or (where so instructed) refraining from acting hereunder or under any of the Security Documents in accordance
with the Credit Agreement or in the limited circumstances specified in Section 8.1(b) hereof, the Majority Holders.  (c) Without
limiting the indemnification provisions of the Credit Agreement, each of the Secured Parties not party to the Credit Agreement severally agrees to indemnify the Agent, to the extent that the Agent shall not have been reimbursed by any Loan Party,
for and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses (including counsel fees and disbursements) or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on,
incurred by or asserted against the Agent in exercising its powers, rights and remedies or performing its duties hereunder or under the Security Documents or otherwise in its capacity as the Agent in any way relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the Security Documents; provided, that no such Secured Party shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements to the extent
that any such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements are found by a final and nonappealable decision of a court of competent

  42 



jurisdiction to have resulted solely and proximately from such Agents gross negligence or willful misconduct in breach of a duty owed to such Secured Party If any indemnity furnished to the
Agent for any purpose shall, in the opinion of the Agent, be insufficient or become impaired, the Agent may call for additional indemnity and cease, or not commence, to do the acts indemnified against until such additional indemnity is furnished.
 (d) No direction given to the Agent which imposes, or purports to impose, upon the Agent any obligation not set forth in or arising under
this Agreement or any Security Document accepted or entered into by the Agent shall be binding upon the Agent.  (e) Prior to the Discharge
of Credit Agreement Obligations, the Agent may resign in accordance with Section 10.9 of the Credit Agreement. After the Agents resignation in accordance with Section 10.9 of the Credit Agreement, the provisions of Section 8
hereof and of Section 10 of the Credit Agreement, if any, shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as Agent. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as the Agent by
a successor Agent in accordance with Section 10.9 of the Credit Agreement, the retiring Agent shall promptly transfer all Collateral within its possession or control to the possession or control of the successor Agent and shall execute and
deliver such notices, instructions and assignments as may be necessary or desirable to transfer the rights of the Agent in respect of the Collateral to the successor Agent. From and after the Discharge of Credit Agreement Obligations, the Majority
Holders shall be entitled to appoint the successor Agent upon the resignation of the Agent.  8.4 Delegation of Duties. The Agent may
perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers under this Agreement or under any Security Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Agent. The Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of its
duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Affiliates. All of the rights, benefits, and privileges (including the exculpatory and indemnification provisions) of this Article 8 shall apply to any of the Affiliates of the
Agent, to any sub-agent of the Agent and to the Affiliates of any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and by the other Security Documents as well as activities as the
Agent. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each sub-agent appointed by the Agent or Affiliate of the Agent or Affiliate of any such sub-agent shall be a third party beneficiary under this Agreement with respect to all such rights,
benefits and privileges (including exculpatory rights and rights to indemnification) and shall have all of the rights and benefits of a third party beneficiary, including an independent right of action to enforce such rights, benefits and privileges
(including exculpatory rights and rights to indemnification) directly, without the consent or joinder of any other Person, against any or all of the Loan Parties and the Secured Parties, and such rights, benefits and privileges (including
exculpatory rights and rights to indemnification) shall not be modified or amended without the consent of such sub-agent or Affiliate acting in such capacity. 
8.5 Foreclosure, etc. No Secured Party shall have any right individually to realize upon any of the Collateral or to enforce any
guarantee of the Obligations except to the extent expressly contemplated by this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, it being understood and agreed that all powers, rights and remedies under the Loan Documents may be exercised solely by the Agent
on behalf of the Secured Parties in accordance with the terms thereof. Each Secured Party, whether or not a party hereto, will be deemed, by its acceptance of the benefits of the Collateral and of the guarantees of the Obligations provided under the
Loan Documents, to have agreed to the foregoing provisions. 
  43 


8.6 Cash Management Banks and Qualified Counterparties. No Cash Management Bank or
Qualified Counterparty that obtains the benefits of the Security Documents or any Collateral by virtue of the provisions of the Credit Agreement or of the Security Documents shall have any right to notice of any action or to consent to, direct or
object to any action under any Loan Document or otherwise in respect of the Collateral (including the release or impairment of any Collateral) other than in its capacity as a Lender and, in such case, only to the extent expressly provided in the
Loan Documents. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 8 to the contrary, the Agent shall not be required to verify the payment of, or that other satisfactory arrangements have been made with respect to, Obligations arising under
Specified Cash Management Agreements and Specified Hedge Agreements unless the Agent has received written notice of such Obligations, together with such supporting documentation as the Agent may request, from the applicable Cash Management Bank or
Qualified Counterparty, as the case may be.  SECTION 9. MISCELLANEOUS 
9.1 Amendments in Writing. None of the terms or provisions of this Agreement may be waived, amended, supplemented or otherwise modified
except in accordance with Section 11.1 of the Credit Agreement. After the Discharge of Credit Agreement Obligations, the provisions of this Agreement may be waived, amended, supplemented or otherwise modified by a written instrument executed by
each Grantor and the Majority Holders.  9.2 Notices. All notices, requests and demands to or upon the Agent or any Grantor hereunder
shall be effected in the manner provided for in Section 11.2 of the Credit Agreement; provided that any such notice, request or demand to or upon any Grantor shall be addressed to such Grantor at its notice address set forth on
Schedule 1.  9.3 No Waiver by Course of Conduct; Cumulative Remedies. No Secured Party shall by any act (except by a written
instrument pursuant to Section 9.1), delay, indulgence, omission or otherwise be deemed to have waived any right or remedy hereunder or to have acquiesced in any Default or Event of Default. No failure to exercise, nor any delay in exercising,
on the part of any Secured Party, any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof. No single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. A waiver by any Secured Party of any right or remedy hereunder on any one occasion shall not be construed as a bar to any right or remedy which such Secured Party would otherwise have on any future
occasion. The rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative, may be exercised singly or concurrently and are not exclusive of any other rights or remedies provided by law. 
9.4 Enforcement Expenses; Indemnification. (a) Each Grantor agrees to pay or reimburse each Secured Party for all its out-of-pocket
costs and expenses incurred in collecting against such Grantor under the guarantee contained in Section 2 or otherwise 
  44 



enforcing or preserving any rights under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which such Grantor is a party, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of one
primary counsel to the Secured Parties and the Agent taken together and a single local counsel in each relevant jurisdiction (and, if there is a conflict of interest, one additional counsel for such persons taken as a whole). 
(b) Each Grantor agrees to pay, and to save the Secured Parties harmless from, any and all liabilities with respect to, or resulting from any
delay in paying, any and all stamp, excise, sales or similar taxes which may be payable or determined to be payable with respect to any of the Collateral or in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to the extent
provided in Section 11.5 of the Credit Agreement.  (c) Each Grantor (including the Borrower) agrees to pay, and to save the Secured
Parties (including all Indemnitees pursuant to Section 11.5 of the Credit Agreement who, by their acceptance of the benefits hereof, agree to be bound by this Agreement) harmless from, any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever with respect to the execution, delivery, enforcement, performance and administration of this Agreement to the extent the Borrower would be
required to indemnify the Agent, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders pursuant to Section 11.5 of the Credit Agreement (it being understood and agreed that the indemnification obligations set forth in this Section 9.4(c) shall apply to
the Secured Parties to the same extent that they apply to the Agent, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders under Section 11.5 of the Credit Agreement). 
(d) The agreements in this Section shall survive repayment of the Obligations and all other amounts payable under the Credit Agreement and the
other Loan Documents and the Specified Hedge Agreements and Specified Cash Management Agreements.  9.5 Successors and Assigns. This
Agreement shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of each Grantor and shall inure to the benefit of the Secured Parties and their successors and assigns; provided that no Grantor may assign, transfer or delegate any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the Agent and any such assignment, transfer or delegation without such consent shall be null and void. 
9.6 Set-Off. Each Grantor hereby irrevocably authorizes each Secured Party (other than any Qualified Counterparty or Cash Management
Bank) at any time and from time to time while an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, without notice to such Grantor or any other Grantor, any such notice being expressly waived by each Grantor, except to the extent prohibited by

parties hereto shall endeavor in good-faith negotiations to replace the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable
provisions.  9.9 Section Headings. The Section headings used in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and are not to

9.12 Submission to Jurisdiction; Waivers. Each Grantor hereby irrevocably and
unconditio

orced in other jurisdictions by suit on
the judgment or in any other manner provided by law and that nothing in this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall affect any right that any Secured Party may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any
other Loan Document against the Grantor or any of its assets in the courts of any jurisdiction;  (d) consents that any such action or
proceeding may be brought in such courts and waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the venue of any such action or proceeding in any such court or that such action or proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not

by registered or certified mail (or any substantially similar form of mail), postage prepaid, to such Grantor at its address referred to in Section 8.2 or at such other address of which the Agent shall have been notified pursuant thereto; 
(f) agrees that nothing herein shall affect the right to effect service of process in any other manner permitted by law; and

the form of Annex 1 hereto. The Grantors shall deliver to the Agent supplements to this Agreement, in form and substance satisfactory to the Agent, as necessary to reflect changes to the Schedules arising after the date hereof. Such
supplements shall become part of this Agreement as of the date of delivery to the Agent.  9.15 Releases. (a) At such time as
there has been a Discharge of the Obligations, the Collateral shall be released from the Liens created hereby, and this Agreement and all obligations (other than those expressly stated to survive such termination) of the Agent and each Grantor
hereunder shall terminate, all without delivery of any instrument or performance of any act by any party, and all rights to the Collateral shall revert to the Grantors. At the request and sole expense of any Grantor following any such termination,
the Agent shall deliver to such Grantor any Collateral held by the Agent hereunder, and execute and deliver to such Grantor such documents as such Grantor shall reasonably request to evidence such termination. 
(b) If any of the Collateral shall be Disposed of by any Grantor in a transaction permitted by the Credit Agreement, then (i) the Liens
created hereby on such Collateral shall automatically be released and (ii) the Agent, at the request and sole expense of such Grantor, shall execute and deliver to such Grantor all releases or other documents reasonably necessary or desirable

hereunder ceases to be a Subsidiary of the Borrower or becomes an Excluded Subsidiary as a result of a transaction permitted by the Loan Documents. 
(c) Each Grantor acknowledges that it is not authorized to file any financing statement (other than financing statements to maintain or

and effect until a Discharge of the Obligations. Each Qualified ECP Guarantor intends that this Section 9.19 constitute, and this Section 9.19 shall be deemed to constitute, a keepwell, support, or other agreement for the
benefit of each other Loan Party for all purposes of Section 1a(18)(A)(v)(II) of the Commodity Exchange Act.

owing by such Payor to such Payee as shown in the books and records of such Payee. The failure to show any such Indebtedness or any error in showing such Indebtedness shall not affect the obligations of any Payor hereunder. Capitalized terms used
herein but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings given such terms in the Credit Agreement, dated as of January 27, 2015 (as amended, supplemented, replaced or otherwise modified from time to time, the Credit
Agreement), among SILICON GRAPHICS INTERNATIONAL CORP., a Delaware corporation (the Borrower), the several banks and other financial institutions or entities from time to time parties thereto (the

Each Payor and any endorser of this Intercompany Note hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, presentment, demand,
protest and notice of any kind. No failure to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any rights hereunder on the part of the holder hereof shall operate as a waiver of such rights.

This Intercompany Note has been pledged by each Payee that is a Loan Party to the Collateral
Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, as security for such Payees Obligations. Each Payor that is a Loan Party acknowledges and agrees that the Collateral Agent and the other Secured Parties, upon the occurrence and during the
continuation of an Event of Default, may exercise all the rights of the Payees under this Intercompany Note and will not be subject to any abatement, reduction, recoupment, defense, setoff or counterclaim available to such Payor. 
Each Payee agrees that any and all claims of such Payee against any Payor or any endorser of this Intercompany Note, or against any of their
respective properties, shall be subordinate and subject in right of payment to the Obligations until the Discharge of the Obligations (as defined in the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement); provided, that each Payor may make payments to the
applicable Payee so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing; provided, further, that upon the waiver, remedy or cure of each such Event of Default, so long as no other Event of Default under the Credit
Agreement shall have occurred and be then continuing, such payments shall be permitted, including any payment to bring any missed payments during the period of such Event of Default current; and provided, further, that all loans and
advances made by a Payee pursuant to this Intercompany Note shall be received by the applicable Payor subject to the provisions of the Credit Agreement. Notwithstanding any right of any Payee to ask, demand, sue for, take or receive any payment from
any Payor, all rights, Liens and security interests of such Payee, whether now or hereafter arising and howsoever existing, in any assets of any Payor (whether constituting part of the security or collateral given to the Collateral Agent or any
other Secured Party to secure payment of all or any part of the Obligations or otherwise) shall be and hereby are subordinated to the rights of the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party in such assets. Except as expressly permitted by the
Credit Agreement, the Payees shall have no right to possession of any such asset or to foreclose upon, or exercise any other remedy in respect of, any such asset, whether by judicial action or otherwise, unless and until the Discharge of the
Obligations.  Each Payee agrees that until the Discharge of the Obligations, such Payee will not amend, modify, supplement, waive or fail
to enforce any provision of this Intercompany Note.  This Intercompany Note shall be binding upon each Payor and its successors and
assigns, and the terms and provisions of this Intercompany Note shall inure to the benefit of each Payee and its successors and assigns, including subsequent holders hereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in any other
Loan Document or in any such intercompany note or other instrument, this Intercompany Note (i) replaces and supersedes any and all intercompany notes or other in

under shall not be affected or diminished by the addition or release of any other Payor or Payee
hereunder. This Intercompany Note shall be fully effective as to any Payor or Payee that is or becomes a party hereto regardless of whether any other Person becomes or fails to become or ceases to be a Payor hereunder. 
This Intercompany Note may be executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which
when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of this Intercompany Note by facsimile or other electronic transmission shall be

The amount that could be obtained by an independent willing seller from an independent willing buyer if the assets of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole are sold with reasonable promptness in an arms-length transaction under present conditions for the sale of comparable business enterprises insofar as such conditions can be reasonably evaluated. 
(c) Stated Liabilities 
The recorded liabilities (including contingent liabilities that would be recorded in accordance with GAAP) of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries
taken as a whole as of the date hereof after giving effect to the consummation of the Transactions, determined in accordance with GAAP consistently applied. 
(d) Identified Contingent Liabilities 


The estimated amount of liabilities reasonably likely to result from pending litigation, asserted
claims and assessments, guaranties, uninsured risks and other contingent liabilities of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole after giving effect to the Transactions (including all fees and expenses related thereto but exclusive of such
contingent liabilities to the extent reflected in Stated Liabilities), as identified and explained in terms of their nature and estimated magnitude by Responsible Officers of the Borrower. 
(e) Will be able to pay their Stated Liabilities and Identified Contingent Liabilities as they mature 
For the period from the date hereof through the Maturity Date, the Borrower and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole will have sufficient assets
and cash flow to pay their respective Stated Liabilities and Identified Contingent Liabilities as those liabilities mature or (in the case of contingent liabilities) otherwise become payable. 
(f) Do not have Unreasonably Small Capital 
For the period from the date hereof through the Maturity Date, the Borrower and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole after consummation of the
Transactions are a going concern and have sufficient capital to ensure that they will continue to be a going concern for such period operating as business is now conducted and proposed to be conducted following the date hereof. 
3. For purposes of this certificate, I, or officers of the Borrower under my direction and supervision, have performed the following
procedures as of and for the periods set forth below.  (a) I have knowledge of and have reviewed to my satisfaction the Credit Agreement.
 (b) As chief financial officer of the Borrower, I am familiar with the financial condition of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries. 
4. Based on and subject to the foregoing, I hereby certify on behalf of the Borrower that after giving effect to the consummation of the
Transactions and the incurrence of Indebtedness and obligations being incurred in connection with the Credit Agreement, it is my opinion that (i) the Fair Value and Present Fair Salable Value of the assets of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries
taken as a whole exceed their Stated Liabilities and Identified Contingent Liabilities; (ii) the Borrower and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole do not have Unreasonably Small Capital; and (iii) the Borrower and its Subsidiaries taken as a
whole will be able to pay their Stated Liabilities and Identified Contingent Liabilities as they mature.  [SIGNATURE PAGE FOLLOWS]
