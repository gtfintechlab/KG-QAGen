2.09 Evidence of Debt. The Loans made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender in
the ordinary course of business. The Administrative Agent shall maintain the Register in accordance with Section 10.06(c). The accounts or records maintained by each Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the
amount of the Loans made by the Lenders to the Borrowers and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrowers hereunder to pay any
amount owing with respect to the Obligations. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the Register, the Register shall control in the absence of manifest error. Upon the request of any Lender to the
applicable Borrower made through the Administrative Agent, such Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative Agent) a Note, which shall evidence such Lenders Loans to the Borrowers in addition to such accounts
or records. Each Lender may attach schedules to its Note and endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable) amount, currency and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto. 
2.10 Payments Generally; Administrative Agents Clawback. 
(a) General. All payments to be made by the Borrowers shall be made free and clear of and without condition or deduction for any
counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein and except with respect to principal of and interest on Loans denominated in Sterling, all payments by the Borrowers hereunder shall be made to the
Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the applicable Administrative Agents Office in the applicable currency and in Same Day Funds not later than 11:00 a.m. on the date specified
herein. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrowers hereunder with respect to principal and interest on Loans denominated in Sterling, and other amounts required to be paid hereunder in Sterling, shall be made to the
Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the applicable Administrative Agents Office in Sterling and in Same Day Funds not later than the Applicable Time specified by the Administrative
Agent on the dates specified herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent may require that any 
  35 





payments due under this Agreement be made in the United States. If, for any reason, a Borrower is prohibited by any Law from making any required payment hereunder in Sterling, such Borrower shall
make such payment in U.S. Dollars in the U.S. Dollar equivalent of the payment amount as reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Applicable Percentage (or other
applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lenders Lending Office. All payments received by the Administrative Agent (i) after 11:00 a.m., in the case of payments in U.S.
Dollars, or (ii) after the Applicable Time specified by the Administrative Agent in the case of payments in Sterling, shall in each case be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to
accrue. If any payment to be made by any Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case
may be.  (b) (i) Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received
notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing of Eurocurrency Rate Loans (or, in the case of any Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, prior to 9:00 a.m. on the date of such Borrowing) that such Lender will not make available to the
Administrative Agent such Lenders share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with Section 2.02 (or, in the case of a
Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, that such Lender has made such share available in accordance with and at the time required by Section 2.02) and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower
a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the applicable Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative
Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the applicable Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative
Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the Overnight Rate, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing, and (B) in
the case of a payment to be made by any Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans. If the applicable Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the
Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the applicable Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the applicable Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount
so paid shall constitute such Lenders Loan included in such Borrowing. Any payment by the applicable Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the applicable Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment
to the Administrative Agent.  (ii) Payments by Borrowers; Presumptions by Administrative Agent. Unless the
Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Company prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that the applicable Borrower will not make such payment, the
Administrative Agent may assume that the applicable Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due. In such event, if such Borrower has not in
fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender, in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date
such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Overnight Rate. 
  36 




A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or any Borrower with respect to any
amount owing under this subsection (b) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.  (c) Failure to Satisfy Conditions
Precedent. If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender to any Borrower as provided in the foregoing provisions of this Article II, and such funds are not made available to such
Borrower by the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable Loans set forth in Article IV are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall return such funds
(in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest.  (d) Obligations of Lenders Several. The obligations
of the Lenders hereunder to make Loans, to make payments pursuant to Section 10.04(c) are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan, to fund any such participation or to make any payment under
Section 10.04(c) on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its
Loan, to purchase its participation or to make its payment under Section 10.04(c).  (e) Funding Source.
Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular
place or manner.  2.11 Sharing of Payments by Lenders. If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or
otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of the Loans made by it, resulting in such Lenders receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of such Loans or participations and accrued interest
thereon greater than its pro rata share thereof as provided herein, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the
Loans of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their
respective Loans and other amounts owing them, provided that:  (i) if any such participations or subparticipations
are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations or subparticipations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and 
(ii) the provisions of this Section shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by or on behalf of any
Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender), or (y) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment
of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or participant, other than an assignment to a Borrower or any Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this Section shall apply). 
Each Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under Applicable Law, that any Lender acquiring a
participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such
participation. 
  37 




2.12 Defaulting Lenders. 
(a) Adjustments. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then,
until such time as that Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law:  (i) Waivers
and Amendments. Such Defaulting Lenders right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in the definitions of Required Lenders,
Required USD Term Lenders and Required GBP Term Lenders and Section 10.01. 
(ii) Defaulting Lender Waterfall. Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the
Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Article VIII or otherwise) or received by the Administrative Agent from a Defaulting Lender pursuant to
Section 10.08 shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent
hereunder; second, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders as a result of any final and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender against such
Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement; third, so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrowers as a result of any
final and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrowers against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this
Agreement; and fourth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans in respect of which such
Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share, and (y) such Loans were made at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 4.01 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay
the Loans of all Non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of such Defaulting Lender until such time as all Loans are held by the Lenders pro rata in
accordance with the Commitments hereunder. Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such
Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.  (b) Defaulting Lender Cure. If the Company and the Administrative
Agent agree in writing that a Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein, that
Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans to be held on a pro rata basis by
the Lenders in accordance with the Commitments, whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrowers
while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of
any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lenders having been a Defaulting Lender. 
  38 




2.13 Designated Borrowers. 
(a) The Company may at any time, upon not less than 10 Business Days notice from the Company to the Administrative Agent (or such shorter
period as may be agreed by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion), whereupon the Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice to the Lenders, designate a Material Subsidiary of the Company that is incorporated under the laws of England
and Wales (an Applicant Borrower) as a Designated Borrower to receive Loans hereunder by delivering to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly deliver counterparts thereof to each Lender) a duly executed notice and
agreement in substantially the form of Exhibit G (a Designated Borrower Request and Assumption Agreement). The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that prior to any Applicant Borrower becoming entitled to utilize the
credit facilities provided for herein the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall have received such supporting resolutions, incumbency certificates (to the extent such concept exists under applicable Law), opinions of counsel and other documents
or information, in form, content and scope reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, as may be required by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion but in any event, subject to differences among jurisdictions, shall be consistent
and within substantially the same scope of documents and information requested to be delivered by the Company on the Closing Date, and Notes signed by such new Borrower to the extent any Lenders so require, subject to
Section 2.09. If the Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders agree that an Applicant Borrower shall be entitled to receive Loans hereunder, then promptly following receipt of all such requested resolutions, incumbency
certificates (to the extent such concept exists under applicable Law), opinions of counsel and other documents or information, the Administrative Agent shall send a notice in substantially the form of Exhibit H (a Designated Borrower
Notice) to the Company and the Lenders specifying the effective date upon which the Applicant Borrower shall constitute a Designated Borrower for purposes hereof (the Designated Borrower Effective Date), whereupon each of the
Lenders agrees to permit such Designated Borrower to receive Loans hereunder, on the terms and conditions set forth herein, and each of the parties agrees that such Designated Borrower otherwise shall be a Borrower for all purposes of this
Agreement; provided that no Loan Notice may be submitted by or on behalf of such Designated Borrower until the date five Business Days after such effective date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) no such approval of an additional
Designated Borrower shall be effective if any Lender cannot legally lend to, establish credit for the account of and/or do any business whatsoever with such Designated Borrower, and (ii) as a condition precedent to such Material Subsidiary
becoming a Designated Borrower hereunder, (x) upon the reasonable request of any Lender made at least five Business Days prior to the Designated Borrower Effective Date, the Company or such Material Subsidiary shall have provided to such
Lender, and such Lender shall be reasonably satisfied with, the documentation and other information so requested in connection with applicable know your customer and anti-money-laundering rules and regulations, including, without
limitation, the Act, in each case at least two Business Days prior to the Designated Borrower Effective Date and (y) at least two Business Days prior to the Designated Borrower Effective Date, if such Material Subsidiary qualifies as a
legal entity customer under the Beneficial Ownership Regulation, it shall have delivered, to each Lender that so requests, a Beneficial Ownership Certification in relation to such Material Subsidiary. 
(b) Without limiting any rights, powers and remedies of the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders under
the Guaranty the Administrative Agent and each Lender agrees that no Foreign Subsidiary is liable to the Administrative Agent or the Lenders for the payment of any Obligations of a Borrower that is a Domestic Subsidiary. Notwithstanding the
preceding sentence or any other provision to the contrary in this Agreement, an Excluded Subsidiary shall not be liable for any obligations of a Domestic Subsidiary, or a Foreign Subsidiary that is a Disregarded Entity and is owned by a Domestic
Subsidiary (provided, however, that any such Excluded Subsidiary shall be liable for its own Obligations). Each Designated Borrower agrees that its liability as set forth above shall not be impaired or affected by any modification,
supplement, extension or amendment of any contract or agreement to which the parties thereto may hereafter agree, nor by any delay, extension of time, renewal, compromise or other indulgence granted by the Administrative Agent or the Lenders with
respect to any of the Obligations, nor 
  39 





by any other agreements or arrangements whatever with any other Designated Borrower or any other Person, each Designated Borrower hereby waiving all notice of any such delay, extension, release,
substitution, renewal, compromise or other indulgence, and hereby consenting to be bound thereby as fully and effectually as if it had expressly agreed thereto in advance. The liability of each Designated Borrower hereunder is direct and
unconditional as to all of the Obligations hereunder for which it is liable, and may be enforced without requiring the Administrative Agent or the Lenders first to resort to any other right, remedy or security; and no Designated Borrower shall have
any right of subrogation, reimbursement or indemnity whatsoever, nor any right of recourse to any security for any of the Obligations, unless and until all of such Obligations have been paid in full. 
(c) Each Subsidiary of the Company that is or becomes a Designated Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.13
hereby irrevocably appoints the Company as its agent for all purposes relevant to this Agreement and each of the other Loan Documents, including (i) the giving and receipt of notices, (ii) the execution and delivery of all documents,
instruments and certificates contemplated herein and all modifications hereto, and (iii) the receipt of the proceeds of any Loans made by the Lenders to any such Designated Borrower hereunder. Any acknowledgment, consent, direction,
certification or other action which might otherwise be valid or effective only if given or taken by all Borrowers, or by each Borrower acting singly, shall be valid and effective if given or taken only by the Company, whether or not any such other
Borrower joins therein. Any notice, demand, consent, acknowledgement, direction, certification or other communication delivered to the Company in accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been delivered to each Designated
Borrower.  (d) The Company may from time to time, upon not less than 15 Business Days notice from the Company to the Administrative
Agent (or such shorter period as may be agreed by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion), terminate a Designated Borrowers status as such, provided that there are no outstanding Loans payable by such Designated Borrower, or
other amounts payable by such Designated Borrower on account of any Loans made to it, as of the effective date of such termination The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Lenders of any such termination of a Designated Borrowers
status.  2.14 Increase in Commitments. 
(a) Request for Increase. Provided there exists no Default, upon notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly notify the
Lenders), the Company may, at any time prior to the Closing Date, request an increase in the Aggregate Commitments by an amount not exceeding £250,000,000; provided that (i) any such request for an increase shall be in a minimum
amount of £10,000,000 or a whole multiple of £1,000,000 in excess thereof, and (ii) the Company may make one such request. At the time of sending such notice, the Company (in consultation with the Administrative Agent) shall specify
the time period within which each Lender is requested to respond (which shall in no event be less than ten Business Days from the date of delivery of such notice to the Lenders). 
(b) Lender Elections to Increase. Each Lender shall notify the Administrative Agent within such time period whether or not it agrees to
increase its Commitment and, if so, whether by an amount equal to, greater than, or less than its Applicable Percentage of such requested increase. Any Lender not responding within such time period shall be deemed to have declined to increase its
Commitment.  (c) Notification by Administrative Agent; Additional Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Company and
each Lender of the Lenders responses to each request made hereunder. To achieve the full amount of a requested increase and subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent, to the extent such approval or consent would have been required in
connection with an assignment pursuant to Section 10.06, the Company may also invite additional Eligible Assignees to become Lenders pursuant to a joinder agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative
Agent and its counsel. 
  40 




(d) Effective Date and Allocations. If the Aggregate Commitments are increased in
accordance with this Section, the Administrative Agent and the Company shall determine the effective date (the Increase Effective Date) and the final allocation of such increase. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the
Company and the Lenders of the final allocation of such increase and the Increase Effective Date.  (e) Conditions to Effectiveness of
Increase. As a condition precedent to such increase, (i) the Company shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a certificate of each Borrower dated as of the Increase Effective Date (in sufficient copies for each Lender) signed by a
Responsible Officer of each Borrower (x) certifying and attaching the resolutions adopted by such Borrower approving or consenting to such increase, and (y) in the case of the Company, certifying that, before and after giving effect to
such increase, (A) the representations and warranties contained in Article V and the other Loan Documents are true and correct in all material respects on and as of the Increase Effective Date, except (i) to the extent that such
representations and warranties are qualified by materiality, that they are true and correct on and as of the Increase Effective Date, (ii) to the extent that such representations and warranties specifically refer to an earlier date, that they
are true and correct in all material respects as of such earlier date except to the extent qualified by materiality, then that they are true and correct as of such earlier date, and except that for purposes of this
Section 2.14, the representations and warranties contained in subsections (a) and (b) of Section 5.05 shall be deemed to refer to the most recent statements furnished pursuant to
subsections (a) and (b),respectively, of Section 6.01, and (B) no Default exists, and (iii) (x) upon the reasonable request of any Lender made at least three days prior to the Increase Effective
Date, the Company shall have provided to such Lender, and such Lender shall be reasonably satisfied with, the documentation and other information so requested in connection with applicable know your customer and anti-money-laundering
rules and regulations, including, without limitation, the Act, in each case at least two days prior to the Increase Effective Date and (y) at least two days prior to the Increase Effective Date, any Borrower that qualifies as a legal
entity customer under the Beneficial Ownership Regulation shall have delivered, to each Lender that so requests, a Beneficial Ownership Certification in relation to such Borrower. 
(f) Conflicting Provisions. This Section 2.14 shall supersede any provisions in
Section 2.11 or 10.01 to the contrary.  ARTICLE III TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY 
3.01 Taxes.  (a)
Defined Terms. For purposes of this Section 3.01, the term Applicable Law includes FATCA. 
(b) Payments Free of Taxes. Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Borrower under any Loan Document shall be
made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by Applicable Law. If any Applicable Law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable Withholding Agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from
any such payment by a Withholding Agent, then the applicable Withholding Agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance
with Applicable Law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the applicable Borrower shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings
applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made. 
  41 




(c) Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrowers. The Borrowers shall timely pay to the
relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with Applicable Law, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes. 
(d) Indemnification by the Borrowers. Each Borrower shall indemnify each Recipient, within 10 days after demand therefor, for the full
amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section), other than any penalties, interest and expenses resulting from any gross negligence of the Administrative
Agent or such Recipient as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment, payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient and any reasonable expenses
arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the
Company by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
(e) Indemnification by the Lenders. Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand
therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Borrower has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of any Borrower to
do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lenders failure to comply with the provisions of Section 10.06(d) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to
such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed
or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the
Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative
Agent under this clause (e).  (f) Evidence of Payments. As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by any Borrower to
a Governmental Authority as provided in this Section 3.01, such Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment,
a copy of any return required by Laws to report such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. 
(g) Status of Lenders; Tax Documentation. 
(i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any
Loan Document shall deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Company or
the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other
documentation prescribed by Applicable Law or reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Company or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is

  42 





subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such
documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 3.01(g)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lenders reasonable judgment such completion, execution or
submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. 
(ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that the applicable Borrower is a U.S. Person: 
(A) any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which
such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Company or the Administrative Agent), executed copies of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such
Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax;  (B) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally
entitled to do so, deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to
time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Company or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable: 
(I) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party
(x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or W-8BEN, as
applicable) establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the interest article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or W-8BEN, as applicable) establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the
business profits or other income article of such tax treaty;  (II) executed copies of IRS Form W-8ECI;  (III) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption
for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit F-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a bank within the
meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a 10 percent shareholder of any Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a controlled foreign corporation described in
Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate) and (y) executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or W-8BEN, as applicable); or  (IV) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial
owner, executed copies of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form
W-8BEN-E (or W-8BEN, as applicable), a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit F-2 or Exhibit F-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as
applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance
Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit F-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner; 
  43 




(C) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so,
deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon
the reasonable request of the Company or the Administrative Agent), executed copies of any other form prescribed by Applicable Law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with
such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by Applicable Law to permit the Company or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and 
(D) if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if
such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent
at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by Applicable Law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code)
and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has
complied with such Lenders obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (D), FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date
of this Agreement.  (iii) Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered pursuant to this
Section 3.01 expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Company and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so. 
(iv) Without limiting the obligations of the Lenders set forth above regarding delivery of certain forms and documents to
establish each Lenders status for withholding Tax purposes under Applicable Law, each Lender agrees to deliver to the Administrative Agent and the Company on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and,
in a timely fashion, from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Administrative Agent or the Company) such other documents and forms required by any relevant taxing authorities under the Laws of any other jurisdiction, duly
executed and completed by such Lender, as are required under Applicable Laws to confirm such Lenders entitlement to any available exemption from, or reduction of, applicable withholding Taxes in respect of all payments to be made to such
Lender outside of the U.S. by the Borrowers pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise to establish such Lenders status for withholding Tax purposes in such other jurisdiction. Each Lender shall promptly (i) notify the Administrative Agent
and the Company of any change in circumstances which would modify or render invalid any such claimed exemption or reduction, and (ii) take such steps as shall not be materially disadvantageous to it, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender,
and as may be reasonably necessary (including the re-designation of its Lending Office) to avoid any requirement of Applicable Laws of any such jurisdiction that any Borrower make any deduction or withholding
for Taxes from amounts payable to such Lender. 
  44 




(h) Treatment of Certain Refunds. Unless required by Applicable Laws, at no time
shall the Administrative Agent have any obligation to file for or otherwise pursue on behalf of a Lender, or have any obligation to pay to any Lender, any refund of Taxes withheld or deducted from funds paid for the account of such Lender. If any
Recipient determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by any Borrower or with respect to which any Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this
Section 3.01, it shall pay to such Borrower an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by a Borrower under this Section 3.01 with
respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) incurred by such Recipient, and without interest (other than any
interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund), provided that each Borrower, upon the request of the Recipient, agrees to repay the amount paid over to such Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or
other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Recipient in the event the Recipient is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this subsection, in no event will
the applicable Recipient be required to pay any amount to such Borrower pursuant to this subsection the payment of which would place the Recipient in a less favorable net after-Tax position than such Recipient
would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This
subsection shall not be construed to require any Recipient to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to any Borrower or any other Person. 
(i) UK Withholding. UK Withholding. 
(i) A UK Tax Deduction on a payment made by an applicable Borrower under a Loan Document shall be regarded as an Excluded Tax
if:  (A) the payment could have been made to the relevant Lender without a UK Tax Deduction if the relevant Lender had been
a UK Qualifying Lender, but on that date that Lender is not or has ceased to be a UK Qualifying Lender other than as a result of any change after the date it became a UK Qualifying Lender under this Agreement in (or in the interpretation
administration, or application of) any law or Treaty or any published practice or published concession of any relevant taxing authority; 
(B) the relevant Lender is a UK Qualifying Lender solely by virtue of paragraph (b) of the definition of UK Qualifying
Lender and:  (I) an officer of HMRC has given (and not revoked) a direction (a Direction) under section 931 of
the Income Tax Act 2007 which relates to the payment and that Lender has received from the applicable Borrower or the Administrative Agent a certified copy of that Direction; and 
(II) the payment could have been made to the Lender without any UK Tax Deduction if that Direction had not been made; or 
(ii) the relevant Lender is a UK Qualifying Lender solely by virtue of paragraph (b) of the definition of UK Qualifying
Lender and: 
  45 




(A) the relevant Lender has not given a UK Tax Confirmation to the
applicable Borrower; and  (B) the payment could have been made to the Lender without any UK Tax Deduction if the Lender had
given a UK Tax Confirmation to the applicable Borrower, on the basis that the UK Tax Confirmation would have enabled the applicable Borrower to have formed a reasonable belief that the payment was an excepted payment for the purpose of
section 930 of the Income Tax Act 2007; or  (iii) the relevant Lender is a UK Treaty Lender and the applicable Borrower is
able to demonstrate that the payment could have been made to the Lender without the Tax Deduction had that Lender complied with its obligations under Section 3.01(j) below. 
(j) UK Treaty Lender - Cooperation. 
(i) Subject to Section 3.01(j)(ii) and Section 3.01(j)(iii) below, a UK
Treaty Lender and the applicable Borrower, shall co-operate in completing any procedural formalities necessary for the applicable Borrower to obtain authorization to make that payment without any UK Tax
Deduction.  (ii) PTR Scheme. In relation to the PTR Scheme: 
(A) If at any time a UK Treaty Lender wishes to use the PTR Scheme in respect of any Eurocurrency Rate Loan made available by
it under this Agreement, provided that (A) the PTR Scheme is capable of applying to such Eurocurrency Rate Loan and (B) all Lenders in relation to that Eurocurrency Rate Loan consent to the use of the PTR Scheme, the Lenders in
relation to that Eurocurrency Rate Loan hereby agree between themselves and irrevocably appoint the Administrative Agent to act as syndicate manager under the PTR Scheme (in such capacity, the Syndicate Manager). 
(B) Each Lender in relation to a Eurocurrency Rate Loan referred to in subsection (ii) of this
Section 3.01(j):  (I) authorizes the Syndicate Manager to operate, and take any action necessary
or desirable under, the PTR Scheme in connection with that Eurocurrency Rate Loan;  (II) shall cooperate with the
Syndicate Manager in completing any procedural formalities necessary under the PTR Scheme and shall promptly supply to the Syndicate Manager such information as the Syndicate Manager may request in connection with the operation of the PTR Scheme;
 (III) without limiting the liability of the applicable Borrower under this Agreement, shall, within five Business Days of
demand, indemnify the Syndicate Manager for any liability or loss incurred by the Syndicate Manager as a result of the Syndicate Manager acting as syndicate manager under the PTR Scheme in connection with the Lenders participation in that
Eurocurrency Rate Loan (except to the extent that the liability or loss arises directly from the Syndicate Managers gross negligence or willful misconduct); and 
  46 




(IV) shall, within five Business Days of demand, indemnify the applicable
Borrower and the Syndicate Manager for any United Kingdom Tax which the applicable Borrower or the Syndicate Manager becomes liable to pay in respect of any payments made to such Lender arising as a result of the withdrawal of a provisional
authority issued by the United Kingdom HM Revenue & Customs under the PTR Scheme, except to the extent that (1) the applicable Borrower would be obliged to increase the amount payable (after payment of such UK Tax Deduction) to such
Lender pursuant to Section 3.01(b) above or (2) the applicable Borrower has not relied on such provisional authority and has withheld amounts in respect of United Kingdom Tax from payments to such Lender. 
(C) the applicable Borrower shall promptly supply to the Syndicate Manager such information as the Syndicate Manager may
reasonably request in connection with the operation of the PTR Scheme.  (D) The Syndicate Manager shall act as syndicate
manager under, and operate, and take any action necessary or desirable under, the PTR Scheme in connection with the relevant Eurocurrency Rate Loan (including, where necessary, notifying the United Kingdom HM Revenue & Customs of new
Lenders under this Agreement) and shall provide, as soon as reasonably practicable, a copy of any provisional authority issued to it under the PTR Scheme in connection with any Eurocurrency Rate Loan to the applicable Borrower. 
(E) All parties acknowledge that the Syndicate Manager: 
(I) is entitled to rely completely upon information provided to it in connection with subsections (ii) or
(iii) of this Section 3.01(j);  (II) is not obliged to undertake any inquiry into the
accuracy of such information, nor into the status of the Lender or, as the case may be, the applicable Borrower providing such information; and 
(F) shall have no liability to any person for the accuracy of any information it submits in connection with subsection
(ii)(A) of this Section 3.01(j).  (iii) Passport Scheme. Without limiting the
foregoing, and in relation to the HMRC DT Treaty Passport Scheme:  (A) A Lender which becomes a party to this Agreement on
the Closing Date that holds a passport under the HMRC DT Treaty Passport Scheme shall include an indication to that effect (for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and without liability to any Borrower) by including its scheme reference number
opposite such Lenders name on its respective signature page to this Agreement.  (B) Where a Lender includes the
indication described in subsection (i) above, the applicable Borrower shall, if such Lender is a Lender under a Loan made available to the applicable Borrower, file a duly completed form DTTP-2 (or
such alternative form as may be specified by the United Kingdom HM Revenue & Customs from time to time, a DTTP-2 Form) in respect of such Lender with the United Kingdom HM
Revenue & Customs within thirty (30) days of the Closing Date and shall promptly provide the Lender with a copy of that filing. 
  47 




(C) A new Lender that holds a passport under the HMRC DT Treaty Passport
Scheme shall include an indication to that effect (for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and without liability to any Borrower) in the Assignment and Assumption or other documentation which it executes to become a Lender by including its
scheme reference number in such documentation.  (D) Where a new Lender includes the indication described in subsection
(iii) of this Section 3.01(j) in the relevant Assignment and Assumption or other documentation which it executes to become a Lender, the applicable Borrower shall, if such Lender becomes a Lender under a Loan which
is made available to the applicable Borrower, file a duly completed DTTP-2 Form in respect of such Lender with the United Kingdom HM Revenue & Customs within 30 days of the date on which the new
Lender becomes a party to this Agreement and shall promptly provide the Lender with a copy of that filing.  (iv) If a
Lender has confirmed its scheme reference number and its jurisdiction of tax residence in accordance with Section 3.01(j)(iii)(A) or (C) above and: 
(A) the applicable Borrower has not made a filing of the DTTP-2 Form in respect of that
Lender; or  (B) the applicable Borrower has made a filing of the DTTP-2 Form in
respect of that Lender but:  (I) that filing of that DTTP-2 Form has been rejected
by HM Revenue & Customs;  (II) HM Revenue & Customs has not given the applicable Borrower authority to
make payments to that Lender without a UK Tax Deduction within 60 days of the date of the filing of that DTTP-2 Form; 
(III) HM Revenue & Customs has given the applicable Borrower authority to make payments to that Lender without a UK
Tax Deduction but such authority has subsequently been revoked or expired,  and, in each case, the applicable Borrower has notified that
Lender in writing, that Lender and the applicable Borrower shall co-operate in completing any additional procedural formalities necessary for the applicable Borrower to obtain authorization to make that
payment without a UK Tax Deduction.  (v) If a Lender has not confirmed its scheme reference number and jurisdiction of tax
residence in accordance with Section 3.01(j)(iii)(A) or (C) above, the applicable Borrower shall not make any filing of a DTTP-2 Form or file any other form relating to
the HMRC DT Treaty Passport Scheme in respect of that Lenders commitment or its participation in any Loans unless the Lender otherwise agrees. 
(k) Lender Status Confirmation. 
(i) Each Lender which becomes a party to this Agreement after the date of this Agreement shall confirm in the documentation it
executes on becoming a party hereto, and for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and without any liability to the applicable Borrower, which of the following categories it falls in for the purposes of any Loan to the applicable Borrower: 
  48 




(ii) not a UK Qualifying Lender; 
(iii) a UK Qualifying Lender (other than a UK Treaty Lender) 
(iv) a UK Treaty Lender 
If a Lender which becomes a party to this Agreement after the date of this Agreement in respect of an advance to the applicable
Borrower fails to indicate its status pursuant to the previous sentence, then such Lender shall be treated for the purposes of this Agreement (including by the applicable Borrower) as if it is not a UK Qualifying Lender until such time as it
notifies the Administrative Agent which category applies (and the Administrative Agent, upon receipt of such notification, shall promptly inform the applicable Borrower). For the avoidance of doubt, any document pursuant to which a Lender becomes
party to this Agreement shall not be invalidated by any failure of a Lender to comply with this Section 3.01(k). 
(v) A Lender which is a UK Qualifying Lender solely by virtue of paragraph (b) of the definition of UK Qualifying Lender
shall upon entering into this Agreement give a UK Tax Confirmation by delivering a written notice to the Administrative Agent (and the Administrative Agent, upon receipt of such notification, shall promptly inform the applicable Borrower). Such a
Lender shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent if there is any change in the position from that set out in the UK Tax Confirmation, following which the Administrative Agent shall notify the applicable Borrower. 
(vi) the applicable Borrower shall promptly upon becoming aware that it has to make a UK Tax Deduction (or that there is any
change in the rate or the basis of a UK Tax Deduction) promptly notify the Administrative Agent accordingly. Similarly, a Lender shall notify the Administrative Agent on becoming so aware in respect of a payment payable to that Lender, and the
Administrative Agent shall notify the applicable Borrower.  (l) Stamp Taxes. The applicable Borrower shall pay and, within three
Business Days of demand, indemnify each Lender against any cost, loss or liability that Lender incurs in relation to all stamp duty, registration and other similar Taxes payable in respect of any Loan Document, except for any such Taxes payable in
connection with the assignment or transfer by any Lender of any of its rights and/or obligations under any Loan Document save in circumstances where such assignment or transfer (A) takes place at a time when an Event of Default is continuing,
(B) is made at the request of any Borrower, or (C) is made as part of the primary syndication of any Loan.  (m) Survival.
Each partys obligations under this Section 3.01 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the
Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other Obligations.  3.02 Illegality. If any Lender determines that
any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to the Eurocurrency Rate
(whether denominated in U.S. Dollars or Sterling), or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to
take deposits of, U.S. Dollars or Sterling in the applicable interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Company through the Administrative Agent, (i) any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Eurocurrency Rate Loans
in the affected currency or currencies or, in the case of Eurocurrency Rate Loans in U.S. Dollars, to convert Base Rate Loans to Eurocurrency Rate Loans, shall be suspended, and (ii) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender

  49 





making or maintaining Base Rate Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the Eurocurrency Rate component of the Base Rate, the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such
Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurocurrency Rate component of the Base Rate, in each case until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Company
that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, (x) the Borrowers shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable and such Loans are
Loans denominated in U.S. Dollars, convert all Eurocurrency Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative
Agent without reference to the Eurocurrency Rate component of the Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such
Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Rate Loans and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of any Lender determining or charging interest rates on the Loans based upon the Eurocurrency Rate, the Administrative Agent
shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the Eurocurrency Rate component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal
for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Rate. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrowers shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted, together with any additional amounts
required pursuant to Section 3.05.  3.03 Inability to Determine Rates. 
(a) If in connection with any request for a Eurocurrency Rate Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof, (i) the Administrative
Agent determines that (A) deposits (whether in U.S. Dollars or Sterling) are not being offered to banks in the applicable offshore interbank market for such currency for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Eurocurrency Rate Loan,
or (B)(x) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurocurrency Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurocurrency Rate Loan (whether denominated in U.S. Dollars or in Sterling) or in connection
with an existing or proposed Base Rate Loan and (y) the circumstances described in Section 3.03(c)(i) do not apply (in each case with respect to this clause (i), Impacted Loans), or
(ii) the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders determine that for any reason the Eurocurrency Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurocurrency Rate Loan (whether denominated in U.S. Dollars or Sterling) does
not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Eurocurrency Rate Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Company and each Lender. Thereafter, (x) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain
Eurocurrency Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Interest Periods), and (y) in the event of a determination described in the preceding sentence with
respect to the Eurocurrency Rate component of the Base Rate, the utilization of the Eurocurrency Rate component in determining the Base Rate shall be suspended, in each case until the Administrative Agent (or, in the case of a determination by the
Required Lenders described in clause (ii) of Section 3.03(a), until the Administrative Agent upon instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Company
may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies (to the extent of the affected Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Interest Periods) or, failing that, will be
deemed to have (x) converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein in the case of a Borrowing in Dollars or (y) revoked such request in the case of a Borrowing in Sterling (if so
affected) unless an alternative rate has been agreed upon pursuant to the next succeeding paragraph. 
  50 




(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Administrative Agent has made the determination
described in clause (a) of this Section, the Administrative Agent, in consultation with the Company, may establish an alternative interest rate for the Impacted Loans, in which case, such alternative rate of interest shall apply
with respect to the Impacted Loans until (1) the Administrative Agent revokes the notice delivered with respect to the Impacted Loans under clause (a) of the first sentence of this Section, (2) the Administrative Agent or the
Required Lenders notify the Administrative Agent and the Company that such alternative interest rate does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding the Impacted Loans, or (3) any Lender determines that any Law has
made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to such alternative rate of interest or
to determine or charge interest rates based upon such rate or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to do any of the foregoing and provides the Administrative Agent and the Company written
notice thereof.  (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other Loan Documents, if the Administrative Agent
determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error), or the Company or Required Lenders notify the Administrative Agent (with, in the case of the Required Lenders, a copy to the Company) that the Company or Required Lenders
(as applicable) have determined, that:   


 
(i)
 adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurocurrency Rate for Dollars for any Interest
Period hereunder or any other tenors of the Eurocurrency Rate for Dollars, including because the Screen Rate applicable to such Loans is not available or published on a current basis and such circumstances are unlikely to be temporary;
  


 
(ii)
 the administrator of the Screen Rate for Dollars or a Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the
Administrative Agent or such administrator has made a public statement identifying a specific date after which the Eurocurrency Rate for Dollars or the Screen Rate applicable to such Loans shall no longer be made available, or used for determining
the interest rate of loans, provided that, at the time of such statement, there is no successor administrator that is satisfactory to the Administrative Agent that will continue to provide the Eurocurrency Rate for Dollars after such specific date
(such specific date, LIBOR Scheduled Unavailability Date);   


 
(iii)
 the administrator of the Screen Rate for Dollars or a Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over such
administrator has made a public statement announcing that all Interest Periods and other tenors of the Eurocurrency Rate for Dollars are no longer representative; 
 


 
(iv)
 syndicated loans currently being executed, or that include language similar to that contained in this
Section 3.03, are being executed or amended (as applicable) to incorporate or adopt a new benchmark interest rate to replace the Eurocurrency Rate for Dollars; 
then, in the case of clauses (i) through (iii) above, on a date and time determined by the Administrative Agent (any such date, the
Replacement Date), which date shall be at the end of an Interest Period or on the relevant interest payment date, as applicable, for interest calculated and shall occur reasonably promptly upon the occurrence of any of the events
or circumstances under clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) above and, solely with respect to clause (ii) above, no later than the LIBOR Scheduled Unavailability Date, the Eurocurrency Rate for Dollars will be replaced
hereunder and under any Loan Document with, subject to the proviso below, the first available alternative set forth in the order below for any payment period for interest calculated that can be determined by the Administrative Agent, in each case,
without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document (the LIBOR Successor Rate; and any such rate before giving effect to the Related Adjustment, the Pre-Adjustment Successor Rate): 
  51 




(x) Term SOFR plus the Related Adjustment; and 
(y) SOFR plus the Related Adjustment; 
and in the case of clause (iv) above, the Administrative Agent and the Company may amend this Agreement solely for the purpose of replacing the
Eurocurrency Rate for Dollars under this Agreement and under any other Loan Document in accordance with the definition of LIBOR Successor Rate and such amendment will become effective at 5:00 p.m., on the fifth Business Day after the
Administrative Agent shall have notified all Lenders and the Company of the occurrence of the circumstances described in clause (iv) above unless, prior to such time, Lenders comprising the Required Lenders have delivered to the
Administrative Agent written notice that such Required Lenders object to the implementation of a LIBOR Successor Rate pursuant to such clause; provided that, if the Administrative Agent determines that Term SOFR has become available, is
administratively feasible for the Administrative Agent and would have been identified as the Pre-Adjustment Successor Rate in accordance with the foregoing if it had been so available at the time that the
LIBOR Successor Rate then in effect was so identified, and the Administrative Agent notifies the Company and each Lender of such availability, then from and after the beginning of the Interest Period, relevant interest payment date or payment period
for interest calculated, in each case, commencing no less than thirty (30) days after the date of such notice, the Pre-Adjustment Successor Rate shall be Term SOFR and the LIBOR Successor Rate shall be
Term SOFR plus the relevant Related Adjustment.  The Administrative Agent will promptly (in one or more notices) notify the Company and each Lender
of (x) any occurrence of any of the events, periods or circumstances under clauses (i) through (iii) above, (y) a Replacement Date and (z) the LIBOR Successor Rate. 
Any LIBOR Successor Rate shall be applied in a manner consistent with market practice; provided, that to the extent such market practice is not
administratively feasible for the Administrative Agent, such LIBOR Successor Rate shall be applied in a manner as otherwise reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent. Notwithstanding anything else herein, if at any time any LIBOR Successor
Rate as so determined would otherwise be less than zero, the LIBOR Successor Rate will be deemed to be zero for the purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. 
In connection with the implementation of a LIBOR Successor Rate, the Administrative Agent will have the right to make LIBOR Successor Rate Conforming Changes
from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such LIBOR Successor Rate Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other
party to this Agreement; provided, that with respect to any such amendment effected, the Administrative Agent shall post each such amendment implementing such LIBOR Successor Rate Conforming Changes to the Company and the Lenders reasonably
promptly after such amendment becomes effective.  If the events or circumstances of the type described in Sections 3.03(c)(i) through
(iii) have occurred with respect to the LIBOR Successor Rate then in effect, then the successor rate thereto shall be determined in accordance with the definition of LIBOR Successor Rate. 
  52 




(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) after any such determination
by the Administrative Agent or receipt by the Administrative Agent of any such notice described under Sections 3.03(c)(i) through (iii), as applicable, if the Administrative Agent determines that none of the LIBOR Successor Rates is
available on or prior to the Replacement Date, (ii) if the events or circumstances described in Section 3.03(c)(iv) have occurred but none of the LIBOR Successor Rates is available, or (iii) if the events or
circumstances of the type described in Sections 3.03(c)(i) through (iii) have occurred with respect to the LIBOR Successor Rate then in effect and the Administrative Agent determines that none of the LIBOR Successor Rates is
available, then in each case, the Administrative Agent and the Company may amend this Agreement solely for the purpose of replacing the Eurocurrency Rate for Dollars or any then current LIBOR Successor Rate in accordance with this Section at the end
of any Interest Period, relevant interest payment date or payment period for interest calculated, as applicable, in accordance with this Section 3.03 with another alternate benchmark rate giving due consideration to any
evolving or then existing convention for U.S. Dollar denominated syndicated credit facilities for such alternative benchmarks and, in each case, including any Related Adjustments and any other mathematical or other adjustments to such benchmark
giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similar U.S. Dollar denominated syndicated credit facilities for such benchmarks, which adjustment or method for calculating such adjustment shall be published on an
information service as selected by the Administrative Agent from time to time in its reasonable discretion and may be periodically updated. For the avoidance of doubt, any such proposed rate and adjustments shall constitute a LIBOR Successor Rate.
Any such amendment shall become effective at 5:00 p.m. on the fifth Business Day after the Administrative Agent shall have posted such proposed amendment to all Lenders and the Company unless, prior to such time, Lenders comprising the Required
Lenders have delivered to the Administrative Agent written notice that such Required Lenders object to such amendment.  (e) If, at the end
of any Interest Period, relevant interest payment date or payment period for interest calculated, no LIBOR Successor Rate has been determined in accordance with Section 3.03(c) or Section 3.03(d)
and the circumstances under Section 3.03(c)(i) or (c)(iii) above exist or the LIBOR Scheduled Unavailability Date has occurred (as applicable), the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Company and each
Lender. Thereafter, (x) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Dollars shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected Eurocurrency Rate Loans, Interest Periods, interest payment dates or
payment periods), and (y) the Eurocurrency Rate component shall no longer be utilized in determining the Base Rate, until the LIBOR Successor Rate has been determined in accordance with Section 3.03(c) or
Section 3.03(d). Upon receipt of such notice, the Company may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Dollars (to the extent of the affected
Eurocurrency Rate Loans, Interest Periods, interest payment dates or payment periods) or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for Base Rate Loans denominated in Dollars (subject to the foregoing clause
(y)).  (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other Loan Document, if the Administrative Agent
determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error), or the Company or Required Lenders notify the Administrative Agent (with, in the case of the Required Lenders, a copy to the Company) that the Company or Required Lenders
(as applicable) have determined, that:  (i) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurocurrency
Rate for Loans denominated in Sterling for any requested Interest Period, including, without limitation, because the Screen Rate for such Loans is not available or published on a current basis and such circumstances are unlikely to be temporary; or

  53 




(ii) the administrator of the Screen Rate for Sterling or a Governmental
Authority having jurisdiction over the Administrative Agent has made a public statement identifying a specific date after which the Eurocurrency Rate for Loans denominated in Sterling or the Screen Rate applicable to such Loans shall no longer be
made available, or used for determining the interest rate of loans denominated in Sterling, provided that, in each case, at the time of such statement, there is no successor administrator that is satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, that will
continue to provide such Eurocurrency Rate for Loans denominated in Sterling after such specific date (such specific date, the Alternative Currency Scheduled Unavailability Date); or 
(iii) syndicated loans currently being executed, or that include language similar to that contained in this
Section 3.03, are being executed or amended (as applicable) to incorporate or adopt a new benchmark interest rate to replace the Eurocurrency Rate for Loans denominated in Sterling; 
then, reasonably promptly after such determination by the Administrative Agent or receipt by the Administrative Agent of such notice, as applicable, the
Administrative Agent and the Company may amend this Agreement solely for the purpose of replacing the Eurocurrency Rate for Loans denominated in Sterling in accordance with this Section 3.03(f) with another alternate
benchmark rate giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similar syndicated credit facilities syndicated in the U.S. and denominated in Sterling for such alternative benchmarks and, in each case, including any
mathematical or other adjustments to such benchmark giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similar syndicated credit facilities syndicated in the U.S. and denominated in Sterling for such benchmarks, each of which
adjustments or methods for calculating such adjustments shall be published on one or more information services as selected by the Administrative Agent from time to time in its reasonable discretion and may be periodically updated (each, an
Adjustment; and any such proposed rate, an Alternative Currency Successor Rate), and any such amendment shall become effective at 5:00 p.m. on the fifth Business Day after the Administrative Agent shall have
posted such proposed amendment to all Lenders and the Company unless, prior to such time, Lenders comprising the Required Lenders have delivered to the Administrative Agent written notice that such Required Lenders object to such amendment. Such
Alternative Currency Successor Rate for Sterling shall be applied in a manner consistent with market practice; provided that to the extent such market practice is not administratively feasible for the Administrative Agent, such Alternative Currency
Successor Rate for such Alternative Currency shall be applied in a manner as otherwise reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent.  If no
Alternative Currency Successor Rate has been determined for Sterling and the circumstances under clause (i) above exist or the Alternative Currency Scheduled Unavailability Date has occurred (as applicable), the Administrative Agent will
promptly so notify the Company and each Lender. Thereafter the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Sterling shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Interest
Periods). Upon receipt of such notice, (i) the Company may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans in Sterling (to the extent of the affected Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Interest Periods) and
(ii) any outstanding affected Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Sterling shall be prepaid at the end of the applicable Interest Period in full. 
Notwithstanding anything else herein, any definition of an Alternative Currency Successor Rate for any currency shall provide that in no event shall such
Alternative Currency Successor Rate be less than zero for purposes of this Agreement.

In connection with the implementation of an Alternative Currency Successor Rate, the Administrative Agent
will have the right to make Successor Rate Conforming Changes with respect to Sterling from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Successor Rate Conforming
Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement; provided that, with respect to any such amendment effected, the Administrative Agent shall post each such amendment implementing such
Successor Rate Conforming Changes for Sterling to the Lenders reasonably promptly after such amendment becomes effective.  3.04
Increased Costs; Reserves on Eurocurrency Rate Loans.  (a) Increased Costs Generally. If any Change in Law shall: 
(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, liquidity, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar
requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement contemplated by Section 3.04(e) and other than as set forth below);
 (ii) subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses
(b) through (g) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital
attributable thereto; or  (iii) impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense
(other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or Eurocurrency Rate Loans made by such Lender or participation therein;  and the result of any of the
foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender
hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender, the Borrowers will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction
suffered.  (b) Capital Requirements. If any Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or any Lending Office of
such Lender or such Lenders holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lenders capital or on the capital of such Lenders holding company,
if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by such Lender to a level below that which such Lender or such Lenders holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into
consideration such Lenders policies and the policies of such Lenders holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrowers will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate
such Lender or such Lenders holding company for any such reduction suffered.  (c) Certificates for Reimbursement. A
certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) of this Section and delivered to the Company shall
be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrowers shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof. 
(d) Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this
Section 3.04 shall not constitute a waiver of such Lenders right to demand such compensation, provided that no Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this
Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine months prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Company of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lenders intention
to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).

  55 




(e) Additional Reserve Requirements. The Borrowers shall pay to each Lender,
(i) as long as such Lender shall be required to maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including Eurocurrency funds or deposits (currently known as Eurocurrency liabilities), additional interest on
the unpaid principal amount of each Eurocurrency Rate Loan equal to the actual costs of such reserves allocated to such Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive), and (ii) as long
as such Lender shall be required to comply with any reserve ratio requirement or analogous requirement of any other central banking or financial regulatory authority imposed in respect of the maintenance of the Commitments or the funding of the
Eurocurrency Rate Loans, such additional costs (expressed as a percentage per annum and rounded upwards, if necessary, to the nearest five decimal places) equal to the actual costs allocated to such Commitment or Loan by such Lender (as determined
by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive), which in each case shall be due and payable on each date on which interest is payable on such Loan, provided the Company shall have received at least 10 days prior
notice (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of such additional interest or costs from such Lender. If a Lender fails to give notice 10 days prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date, such additional interest or costs shall be due and payable
10 days from receipt of such notice.  3.05 Compensation for Losses. Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative
Agent) from time to time, the Borrowers shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of: 
(a) any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the
Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise);  (b) any failure by any
Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the applicable Borrower; 
(c) any failure by any Borrower to make payment of any Loan (or interest due thereon) denominated in Sterling on its scheduled due date or any
payment thereof in a different currency; or  (d) any assignment of a Eurocurrency Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the
Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the Company pursuant to Section 10.13; excluding, however, any loss of anticipated profits, but including any foreign exchange losses and any loss or expense arising from
the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan, from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained or from the performance of any foreign exchange contract. The Borrowers shall also pay any
customary administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing.  For purposes of calculating amounts payable by any Borrower to the
Lenders under this Section 3.05, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Eurocurrency Rate Loan made by it at the Eurocurrency Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the offshore
interbank market for such currency for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Eurocurrency Rate Loan was in fact so funded. 
  56 




3.06 Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders. 
(a) Designation of a Different Lending Office. Each Lender may make any Loan to the Borrowers through any Lending Office,
provided that the exercise of this option shall not affect the obligation of any Borrower to repay its Loan in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.04, or
requires any Borrower to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender, or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.01, or if any Lender gives a notice pursuant to
Section 3.02, then at the request of the Company such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different Lending Office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder
to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.01 or 3.04, as the case
may be, in the future, or eliminate the need for the notice pursuant to Section 3.02, as applicable, and (ii) in each case, would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be
disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrowers hereby agree to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment. 
(b) Replacement of Lenders. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.04, or if any Borrower is
required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.01 and, in each case, such Lender has declined or is unable to
designate a different lending office in accordance with Section 3.06(a), The Company may replace such Lender in accordance with Section 10.13. 
3.07 Survival. All obligations of the Borrowers under this Article III shall survive termination of the Aggregate Commitments,
repayment of all other Obligations hereunder, and resignation of the Administrative Agent.  ARTICLE IV CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO LOANS

ARTICLE IX ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT 
9.01 Appointment and Authority. Each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably appoints Bank of America to act on its behalf as the
Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof or thereof,
together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The provisions of this Article are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, and no Borrower shall have rights as a third party beneficiary of any of
such provisions. It is understood and agreed that the use of the term agent herein or in any other Loan Documents (or any other similar term) with reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other
implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any Applicable Law. Instead such term is used as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting parties. 
9.02 Rights as a Lender. The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity
as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent and the term Lender or Lenders shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires,
include the Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, own securities of, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity
for and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrowers or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders. 
9.03 Exculpatory Provisions. The Administrative Agent or the Arrangers, as applicable, shall not have any duties or obligations except
those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, and its duties hereunder shall be administrative in nature. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent or the Arrangers, as applicable: 
(a) shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is
continuing;  (b) shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except
discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as
shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents), provided that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent to
liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or Applicable Law, including for the avoidance of doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any Debtor Relief Law or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or
termination of property of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any Debtor Relief Law; and  (c) shall not
have any duty or responsibility to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, to any Lender, any credit or other information concerning the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition or
creditworthiness of any of the Borrowers or any of their Affiliates, that is communicated to, obtained by or in the possession of, the Administrative Agent, Arrangers or any of their Related Parties in any capacity, except for notices, reports and
other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent herein;  (d) shall not be
liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith
shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Sections 10.01 and 8.02) or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and
nonappealable judgment. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until notice describing such Default is given in writing to the Administrative Agent by the Company or a Lender; and 
  78 




(e) shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire
into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection
herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or
genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly
required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.  9.04 Reliance by Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be
entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other
distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been
made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender, the Administrative
Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender prior to the making of such Loan. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal
counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrowers), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts. 
9.05 Delegation of Duties. The Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder
or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through
their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in
connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any
sub-agents except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and non-appealable judgment that the Administrative Agent acted with gross
negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such sub-agents.  9.06 Resignation of
Administrative Agent.  (a) The Administrative Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders and the Company. Upon
receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the Company, to appoint a successor, which shall be a bank with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an
office in the United States. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation (or such earlier
day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the Resignation Effective Date), then the retiring Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent
meeting the qualifications set forth above, provided that in no event shall any such successor Administrative Agent be a Defaulting Lender. Whether or not a successor has been appointed, such resignation shall become effective in accordance
with such notice on the Resignation Effective Date. 
  79 




(b) If the Person serving as Administrative Agent is a Defaulting Lender pursuant to
clause (d) of the definition thereof, the Required Lenders may, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, by notice in writing to the Company and such Person remove such Person as Administrative Agent and, in consultation with the
Company, appoint a successor. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the Removal
Effective Date), then such removal shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice on the Removal Effective Date. 
(c) With effect from the Resignation Effective Date or the Removal Effective Date (as applicable) (1) the retiring or removed
Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (except that in the case of any collateral security held by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders under any of the Loan
Documents, the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall continue to hold such collateral security until such time as a successor Administrative Agent is appointed) and (2) except for any indemnity payments or other amounts then owed to
the retiring or removed Administrative Agent, all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender directly, until such time, if any, as the
Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided for above. Upon the acceptance of a successors appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights,
powers, privileges and duties of the retiring or removed Administrative Agent (other than as provided in Section 3.01(m) and other than any rights to indemnity payments or other amounts owed to the retiring or removed
Administrative Agent as of the Resignation Effective Date or the Removal Effective Date, as applicable), and the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan
Documents (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this Section). The fees payable by the Borrowers to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the
Borrowers and such successor. After the retiring or removed Administrative Agents resignation or removal hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article and Section 10.04 shall continue in
effect for the benefit of such retiring or removed Administrative Agent, its sub agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them (i) while the retiring or removed Administrative
Agent was acting as Administrative Agent and (ii) after such resignation or removal for as long as any of them continues to act in any capacity hereunder or under the other Loan Documents, including in respect of any actions taken in connection
with transferring the agency to any successor Administrative Agent.  (d) Any successor Administrative Agent appointed hereunder shall be an
existing Lender at the time of such appointment.  9.07 Non-Reliance on the Administrative Agent,
the Arrangers and the Other Lenders. Each Lender expressly acknowledges that none of the Administrative Agent nor any Arranger has made any representation or warranty to it, and that no act by the Administrative Agent or any Arranger hereafter
taken, including any consent to, and acceptance of any assignment or review of the affairs of any Borrower of any Affiliate thereof, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by the Administrative Agent or any Arranger to any
Lender as to any matter, including whether the Administrative Agent or any Arranger have disclosed material information in their (or their Related Parties) possession. Each Lender 
  80 





represents to the Administrative Agent and the Arrangers that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers, any other Lender or any of their Related
Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis of, appraisal of, and investigation into, the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and
creditworthiness of the Borrowers and their Subsidiaries, and all applicable bank or other regulatory Laws relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, and made its own decision to enter into this Agreement and to extend credit to the Borrowers
hereunder. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, any Arranger, any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time
to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or
thereunder, and to make such investigations as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrowers. Each Lender represents and warrants, as of
the date hereof, that (i) the Loan Documents set forth the terms of a commercial lending facility and (ii) it is engaged in making, acquiring or holding commercial loans in the ordinary course and is entering into this Agreement as a
Lender for the purpose of making, acquiring or holding commercial loans and providing other facilities set forth herein as may be applicable to such Lender, and not for the purpose of purchasing, acquiring or holding any other type of financial
instrument, and each Lender agrees not to assert a claim in contravention of the foregoing. Each Lender represents and warrants, as of the date hereof, that it is sophisticated with respect to decisions to make, acquire and/or hold commercial loans
and to provide other facilities set forth herein, as may be applicable to such Lender, and either it, or the Person exercising discretion in making its decision to make, acquire and/or hold such commercial loans or to provide such other facilities,
is experienced in making, acquiring or holding such commercial loans or providing such other facilities.  9.08 No Other Duties, Etc.
Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none of the Bookrunners, Arrangers, Syndication Agents or Documentation Agents listed on the cover page hereof shall have any powers, duties or responsibilities under this Agreement or any of the
other Loan Documents, except in its capacity, as applicable, as the Administrative Agent or a Lender hereunder.  9.09 Administrative
Agent May File Proofs of Claim. In case of the pendency of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or any other judicial proceeding relative to any Borrower, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan shall
then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on any Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or
otherwise:  (a) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of
the Loans and all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent (including any claim for the reasonable
compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders and the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.07 and 10.04)
allowed in such judicial proceeding; and  (b) to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on
any such claims and to distribute the same; 
  81 




and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any
such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders, to pay to the
Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Administrative Agent under
Sections 2.07 and 10.04.  Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative Agent
to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Lender to authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect
of the claim of any Lender in any such proceeding.  9.10 Certain ERISA Matters.

date such Person became a Lender party hereto to the date such Person ceases being a Lender party hereto, for the benefit of, the Administrative Agent, and not, for the avoidance of doubt, to or for the benefit of any Borrower, that at least one of
the following is and will be true:  (i) such Lender is not using plan assets (within the meaning of

Commitments and this Agreement, (C) the entrance into, participation in, administration of and performance of the Loans, the Commitments and this Agreement satisfies the requirements of sub-sections
(b) through (g) of Part I of PTE 84-14 and (D) to the best knowledge of such Lender, the requirements of subsection (a) of Part I of PTE 84-14 are
satisfied with respect to such Lenders entrance into, participation in, administration of and performance of the Loans, the Commitments and this Agreement, or 
(iv) such other representation, warranty and covenant as may be agreed in writing between the Administrative Agent, in its sole
discretion, and such Lender.  (b) In addition, unless either (1) clause (i) in the immediately preceding clause
(a) is true with respect to a Lender or (2) a Lender has provided another representation, warranty and covenant in accordance with clause (iv) in the immediately preceding clause (a), such Lender further
(x) represents and warrants, as of the date such Person became a Lender party hereto, to, and (y) covenants, from the date such Person became a Lender party hereto to the date such Person ceases being a Lender party hereto, for the

  82

such Lender involved in such Lenders entrance into, participation in, administration of and performance of the Loans, the Commitments and this Agreement (including in connection with the reservation or exercise of any rights by the
Administrative Agent under this Agreement, any Loan Document or any documents related hereto or thereto).  ARTICLE X MISCELLANEOUS

amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, and no consent to any departure by any Borrower therefrom, shall be effective unless in writing signed by the Required Lenders and the Company (for and on behalf of
the Borrowers) and acknowledged by the Administrative Agent, and each such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given; provided, however, that no such amendment,

Loan, Section 4.02, without the written consent of each Lender;  (b) extend or increase the Commitment(s) of any
Lender (or reinstate any Commitment terminated pursuant to Section 8.02) without the written consent of such Lender, it being understood that a waiver of any condition precedent set forth in

the Lenders (or any of them) hereunder or under any other Loan Document without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby;

(i) only the consent of the Required Lenders shall be necessary to amend the definition of Default Rate or to waive any obligation of any Borrower to pay interest at the Default Rate, and (ii) any change to the definition of
Consolidated Leverage Ratio or in the component definitions thereof shall not constitute a reduction in the rate;  (e) (i)

(i) add a different currency (other than U.S. Dollars and Sterling) without the consent of each Lender;

to the Lenders required above, affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent under this Agreement or any other Loan Document; and (ii) the Fee Letter may be amended, or rights or privileges thereunder waived, in a writing executed
only by the parties thereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Defaulting Lender shall have any right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent hereunder (and any amendment, waiver or consent which by its terms
requires the consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender may be effected with the consent of the applicable Lenders other than Defaulting Lenders), except that (x) the Commitment of any Defaulting Lender may not be increased or extended or
the maturity of any of its Loans may not be extended, the rate of interest on any of its Loans may not be reduced and the principal amount of any of its Loans may not be forgiven, in each case without the consent of such Defaulting Lender,
(y) Section 8.03 may not be changed in any manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby without the consent of such Lender and (z) any waiver, amendment, consent or modification
requiring the consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender that by its terms affects any Defaulting Lender more adversely relative to other affected Lenders shall require the consent of such Defaulting Lender. 
Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, this Agreement may be amended with the written consent of the Required Lenders, the
Administrative Agent and the Company (i) to add one or more additional term loan facilities to this Agreement, in each case subject to the limitations in Section 2.14, and to permit the extensions of credit and all
related obligations and liabilities arising in connection therewith from time to time outstanding to share ratably (or on a basis subordinated to the existing facilities hereunder) in the benefits of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents with
the obligations and liabilities from time to time outstanding in respect of the existing facilities hereunder, and (ii) in connection with the foregoing, to permit, as deemed appropriate by the Administrative Agent and approved by the Required
Lenders, the Lenders providing such additional credit facilities to participate in any required vote or action required to be approved by the Required Lenders or by any other number, percentage or class of Lenders hereunder. 
Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, if the Administrative Agent and the Company acting together identify any ambiguity,
omission, mistake, typographical error or other defect in any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document (including the schedules and exhibits thereto), then the Administrative Agent and the Company shall be permitted to amend, modify or
supplement such provision to cure such ambiguity, omission, mistake, typographical error or other defect, and such amendment shall become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement. The Administrative Agent

WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS OR FREEDOM FROM VIRUSES OR OTHER CODE
DEFECTS, IS MADE BY ANY AGENT PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH THE BORROWER MATERIALS OR THE PLATFORM. In no event shall the Administrative Agent or any of its Related Parties (collectively, the Agent Parties) have any liability to any
Borrower, any Lender or any other Person for losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses of any kind (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) arising out of any Borrowers or the Administrative Agents transmission of Borrower
Materials or notices through the Platform, any other electronic platform or electronic messaging service, or through the Internet.  (d)

specified herein, were incomplete or were not preceded or followed by any other form of notice specified herein, or (ii) the terms thereof, as understood by the recipient, varied from any confirmation thereof. The Borrowers shall indemnify the
Administrative Agent, each Lender and the Related Parties of each of them from all losses, costs, expenses and liabilities resulting from the reliance by such Person on each notice purportedly given by or on behalf of any Borrower. All telephonic
notices to and other telephonic communications with the Administrative Agent may be recorded by the Administrative Agent, and each of the parties hereto hereby consents to such recording. 
10.03 No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies; Enforcement. No failure by any Lender or the Administrative Agent to exercise, and no delay by any
such Person in exercising, any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. The rights, remedies, powers and privileges herein provided, and provided under each other Loan Document, are cumulative and not exclusive of any
rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided by law. 
  86 




Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any other Loan Document, the
authority to enforce rights and remedies hereunder and under the other Loan Documents against the Borrowers shall be vested exclusively in, and all actions and proceedings at law in connection with such enforcement shall be instituted and maintained
exclusively by, the Administrative Agent in accordance with Section 8.02 for the benefit of all the Lenders; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not prohibit (a) the Administrative Agent from
exercising on its own behalf the rights and remedies that inure to its benefit (solely in its capacity as Administrative Agent) hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, (b) any Lender from exercising setoff rights in accordance with
Section 10.08 (subject to the terms of Section 2.11), or (c) any Lender from filing proofs of claim or appearing and filing pleadings on its own behalf during the pendency of a proceeding
relative to any Borrower under any Debtor Relief Law; and provided, further, that if at any time there is no Person acting as Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, then (i) the Required Lenders shall
have the rights otherwise ascribed to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 8.02 and (ii) in addition to the matters set forth in clauses (b) and (c) of the preceding proviso and subject to
Section 2.11, any Lender may, with the consent of the Required Lenders, enforce any rights and remedies available to it and as authorized by the Required Lenders. 
10.04 Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver. 
(a) Costs and Expenses. The Company shall pay (i) all reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent and its Affiliates (including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of one counsel for the
Administrative Agent and, if necessary, one local counsel in each applicable jurisdiction), in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein, the preparation, negotiation, execution, delivery and administration of this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents or any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof or thereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be consummated), and (ii) all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent or any Lender (including the fees, charges and disbursements of one counsel for the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders and if necessary one local counsel in each applicable jurisdiction and one additional counsel for each affected party in the event of a conflict of interest), and shall pay all fees and time charges for attorneys who may be employees of the

Loans made hereunder, including all such out-of-pocket expenses incurred during any workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect of such Loans. 
(b) Indemnification by the Company. The Company shall indemnify the Administrative Agent (and any
sub-agent thereof) and each Lender, and each Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an Indemnitee) against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any
and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses (including the fees, charges and disbursements of one counsel to the Indemnitees taken as a whole and, if necessary, one firm of local counsel in each appropriate jurisdiction, and,
in the case of an actual or perceived conflict of interests where the Indemnitee affected by such conflict informs the Company of such conflict, one additional counsel to each group of affected Indemnitees similarly situated taken as a whole), and
shall indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnitee from all fees and time charges and disbursements for attorneys who may be employees of any Indemnitee, incurred by any Indemnitee or asserted against any Indemnitee by any Person (including any
Borrower) other than such Indemnitee and its Related Parties arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or
thereby, the performance by the parties hereto of their respective obligations hereunder or thereunder, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or, in the case of the Administrative Agent (and any sub agent thereof) and
its Related Parties only, the administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (including in respect of any matters addressed in Section 3.01), (ii) any Loan or the use or proposed use of the proceeds
therefrom, or (iii) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory, whether brought by a third party or by any Borrower, and

  87 





regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto, IN ALL CASES, WHETHER OR NOT CAUSED BY OR ARISING, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, OUT OF THE COMPARATIVE, CONTRIBUTORY OR SOLE NEGLIGENCE OF THE
INDEMNITEE; provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses (x) are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final
and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence, or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee or, (y) result from a claim brought by any Borrower against an Indemnitee for a breach in bad faith of such Indemnitees
obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document, if such Borrower has obtained a final and nonappealable judgment in its favor on such claim as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. Without limiting the provisions of
Section 3.01, this Section 10.04(b) shall not apply with respect to Taxes other than any Taxes that represent losses, claims, damages, etc. arising from any
non-Tax claim.  (c) Reimbursement by Lenders. To the extent that the Company for any reason
fails to indefeasibly pay any amount required under subsection (a) or (b) of this Section to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent (or any sub-agent thereof) or any Related Party
thereof, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent) or such Related Party, as the case may be, such Lenders pro rata share (determined as of the time that the
applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought based on each Lenders Applicable Percentage at such time) of such unpaid amount (including any such unpaid amount in respect of a claim asserted by such Lender), such payment to be
made severally among them based on such Lenders Applicable Percentage (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought), provided further that the unreimbursed expense or
indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent), or against any Related Party of any of
the foregoing acting for the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent). The obligations of the Lenders under this subsection (c) are subject to the provisions of
Section 2.10(d).  (d) Waiver of Consequential Damages, Etc. To the fullest extent permitted by Applicable
Law, no Borrower shall assert, and hereby waives, and acknowledges that no other Person shall have, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or
actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, any Loan or the use of the proceeds
thereof. No Indemnitee referred to in subsection (b) above shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by unintended recipients of any information or other materials distributed to such unintended recipients by such Indemnitee
through telecommunications, electronic or other information transmission systems in connection with this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby other than for direct or actual damages resulting from
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee as determined by a final and nonappealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. 
(e) Payments. All amounts due under this Section shall be payable not later than ten Business Days after demand therefor. 
(f) Survival. The agreements in this Section and the indemnity provisions of Section 10.02(e) shall survive
the resignation of the Administrative Agent, the replacement of any Lender, the termination of the Aggregate Commitments, the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all the other Obligations and the termination of this Agreement. 
  88 




10.05 Payments Set Aside. To the extent that any payment by or on behalf of any
Borrower is made to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, or the Administrative Agent or any Lender exercises its right of setoff, and such payment or the proceeds of such setoff or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be
fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Administrative Agent or such Lender in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in connection with any
proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or otherwise, then (a) to the extent of such recovery, the obligation or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not
been made or such setoff had not occurred, and (b) each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent upon demand its applicable share (without duplication) of any amount so recovered from or repaid by the Administrative Agent,
plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such payment is made at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect, in the applicable currency of such recovery or payment. The
obligations of the Lenders under clause (b) of the preceding sentence shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement. 
10.06 Successors and Assigns. 
(a) Successors and Assigns Generally. The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that no Borrower may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and each Lender,
and no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder except (i) to an assignee in accordance with the provisions of subsection (b) of this Section, (ii) by way of participation in accordance
with the provisions of subsection (d) of this Section, or (iii) by way of pledge or assignment of a security interest subject to the restrictions of subsection (e) of this Section (and any other attempted assignment or
transfer by any party hereto shall be null and void). Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby,
Participants to the extent provided in subsection (d) of this Section and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or
claim under or by reason of this Agreement.  (b) Assignments by Lenders. Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more assignees
all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it); provided that any such assignment shall be subject to the following conditions: 
(i) Minimum Amounts. 
(A) in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lenders Commitment and/or the Loans at
the time owing to it or contemporaneous assignments to related Approved Funds (determined after giving effect to such Assignments) that equal at least the amount specified in clause (b)(i)(B) of this Section in the aggregate or in the case of
an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund, no minimum amount need be assigned; and  (B) in
any case not described in subsection (b)(i)(A) of this Section, the aggregate amount of any Commitment (which for this purpose includes Loans outstanding thereunder) or, if the applicable Commitment is not then in effect, the principal
outstanding balance of the Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment, determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if Trade Date
is specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade Date, shall not be less than $5,000,000 (or, in the case of the GBP Term Facility, £5,000,000) unless each of the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, the Company otherwise consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). 
  89 




(ii) Proportionate Amounts. Each partial assignment shall be made as
an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Loans or the Commitment assigned; 
(iii) Required Consents. No consent shall be required for any assignment except to the extent required by subsection
(b)(i)(B) of this Section and, in addition:  (A) the consent of the Company (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) shall be required unless (1) an Event of Default pursuant to Section 8.01(a), (f) or (g) has occurred and is continuing at the time of such assignment or (2) such assignment
is to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund; provided that the Company shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment unless it shall object thereto by written notice to the Administrative Agent within ten
(10) Business Days after having received notice thereof; and  (B) the consent of the Administrative Agent (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required for assignments in respect of any unfunded Commitment if such assignment is to a Person that is not a Lender, an Affiliate of such Lender or an Approved Fund with respect to such
Lender.  (iv) Assignment and Assumption. The parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the
Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee in the amount of $3,500; provided, however, that the Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, elect to waive such processing and
recordation fee in the case of any assignment. The assignee, if it is not a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire. 
(v) No Assignment to Certain Persons. No such assignment shall be made (A) to any Borrower or any of such
Borrowers Affiliates or Subsidiaries, (B) to any Defaulting Lender or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Person who, upon becoming a Lender hereunder, would constitute any of the foregoing Persons described in this clause (B), or
(C) to a natural Person (or a holding company, investment vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated for the primary benefit of a natural Person). 
(vi) Certain Additional Payments. In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender
hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments to the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount
sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with the consent of the Company and the
Administrative Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Loans previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full all
payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon) and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro rata share of all Loans in accordance with its
Applicable Percentage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under Applicable Law without compliance with the provisions of this paragraph,
then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs. 
  90 




Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection
(c) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption,
have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the
case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01,
3.04, 3.05, and 10.04 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment; provided that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no assignment
by a Defaulting Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lenders having been a Defaulting Lender. Upon request, each Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and deliver a Note to the
assignee Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this subsection shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such
rights and obligations in accordance with subsection (d) of this Section.  (c) Register. The Administrative Agent,
acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrowers (and such agency being solely for Tax purposes), shall maintain at the Administrative Agents Office a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it (or the equivalent thereof
in electronic form) and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts (and stated interest) of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time
(the Register). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the
terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrowers and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. 
(d) Participations. Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, any Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell
participations to any Person (other than a natural Person, or a holding company, investment vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated for the primary benefit of a natural Person, a Defaulting Lender or the Company or any of the Companys
Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a Participant) in all or a portion of such Lenders rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans owing to it);
provided that (i) such Lenders obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the
Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, each Lender shall be
responsible for the indemnity under Section 10.04(c) without regard to the existence of any participation.  Any
agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this
Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in the first proviso to
Section 10.01 that affects such Participant. 
  91 





The Borrowers agree that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04 and 3.05 (subject to the requirements and limitations therein, including
the requirements under Section 3.01(g) (it being understood that the documentation required under Section 3.01(g) shall be delivered to the Lender who sells the participation)) to the same extent
as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section; provided that such Participant (A) agrees to be subject to the provisions of Sections 3.06 and 10.13
as if it were an assignee under subsection (b) of this Section and (B) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 3.01 or 3.04, with respect to any participation, than the Lender from whom it
acquired the applicable participation would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation. Each
Lender that sells a participation agrees, at the Companys request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Company to effectuate the provisions of Section 3.06 with respect to any Participant. To
the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.08 as though it were a Lender; provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to
Section 2.11 as though it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrowers, maintain a register on
which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participants interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the Participant Register);
provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participants interest in any commitments, loans,
letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under
Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each
Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as
Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.  (e) Certain Pledges. Any Lender may at
any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal
Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. 
10.07 Treatment of Certain Information; Confidentiality. Each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders agrees to maintain the
confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its Affiliates, its auditors and its Related Parties (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed
of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the extent required or requested by any regulatory authority purporting to have jurisdiction over such Person or its Related Parties
(including any self-regulatory authority, such as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners), (c) to the extent required by Applicable Laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to any other party hereto,
(e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or under any other Loan Document or any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder,
(f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section, to (i) any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights and obligations under this
Agreement or any Eligible Assignee invited to be a Lender pursuant to Section 2.14, (ii) any actual or prospective party (or its Related Parties) to any swap, derivative or other transaction under which payments are to be
made by reference to any of the Borrowers and their obligations, this Agreement or payments hereunder or (iii) any credit insurance 
  92 





provider relating to the Borrowers and their Obligations, (g) on a confidential basis to (i) any rating agency in connection with rating the Borrowers or their Subsidiaries or the
credit facilities provided hereunder or (ii) the CUSIP Service Bureau or any similar agency in connection with the application, issuance, publishing and monitoring of CUSIP numbers or other market identifiers with respect to the credit
facilities provided hereunder, (h) with the consent of the Company or (i) to the extent such Information (x) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section, (y) becomes available to the
Administrative Agent, any Lender or any of their respective Affiliates on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than a Borrower or (z) is independently discovered or developed by a party hereto without utilizing any Information received
from a Borrower or violating the terms of this Section 10.07. In addition, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may disclose the existence of this Agreement and information about this Agreement to market data
collectors, similar service providers to the lending industry and service providers to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in connection with the administration of this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, and the Commitments. 
For purposes of this Section, Information means all information received from any Borrower or any Subsidiary relating to any
Borrower or any Subsidiary or any of their respective businesses, other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by any Borrower or any Subsidiary. Any
Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such
Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information.  Each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders
acknowledges that (a) the Information may include material non-public information concerning each Borrower or a Subsidiary, as the case may be, (b) it has developed compliance procedures regarding
the use of material non-public information and (c) it will handle such material non-public information in accordance with Applicable Law, including United States
Federal and state securities Laws.  10.08 Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender
and each of their respective Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final,
in whatever currency) at any time held and other obligations (in whatever currency) at any time owing by such Lender or any such Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of any Borrower against any and all of the obligations of such Borrower
now or hereafter existing under this Agreement or any other Loan Document to such Lender or its Affiliates, irrespective of whether or not such Lender or Affiliate shall have made any demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and
although such obligations of such Borrower may be contingent or unmatured or are owed to a branch, office or Affiliate of such Lender different from the branch, office or Affiliate holding such deposit or obligated on such indebtedness;
provided, that in the event that any Defaulting Lender shall exercise any such right of setoff hereunder, (x) all amounts so set off shall be paid over immediately to the Administrative Agent for further application in accordance with
the provisions of Section 2.11 and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and
(y) the Defaulting Lender shall provide promptly to the Administrative Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the Obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as to which it exercised such right of setoff. The rights of each Lender
and their respective Affiliates under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that such Lender or their its Affiliates may have. Each Lender agrees to notify the Company and the Administrative
Agent promptly after any such setoff and application, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application. 
  93 




10.09 Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
any Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid under the Loan Documents shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious interest permitted by Applicable Law (the Maximum Rate).
If the Administrative Agent or any Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the applicable
Borrower. In determining whether the interest contracted for, charged, or received by the Administrative Agent or a Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, (a) characterize any payment that
is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest
throughout the contemplated term of the Obligations hereunder.  10.10 Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. 
(a) This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto in different counterparts), each of which shall constitute
an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement, the other Loan Documents, and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the Administrative Agent, constitute the entire
contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. Except as provided in Section 4.01,
this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof that, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties
hereto. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by facsimile or other electronic imaging means (e.g. pdf or tif) shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this
Agreement.  (b) This Agreement and any document, amendment, approval, consent, information, notice, certificate, request, statement,
disclosure or authorization related to this Agreement (each a Communication), including Communications required to be in writing, may be in the form of an Electronic Record and may be executed using Electronic Signatures. The
Borrowers agrees that any Electronic Signature on or associated with any Communication shall be valid and binding on each Borrower to the same extent as a manual, original signature, and that any Communication entered into by Electronic Signature,
will constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation of each Borrower enforceable against such in accordance with the terms thereof to the same extent as if a manually executed original signature was delivered. Any Communication may be
executed in as many counterparts as necessary or convenient, including both paper and electronic counterparts, but all such counterparts are one and the same Communication. For the avoidance of doubt, the authorization under this paragraph may
include, without limitation, use or acceptance by the Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders of a manually signed paper Communication which has been converted into electronic form (such as scanned into PDF format), or an electronically signed
Communication converted into another format, for transmission, delivery and/or retention. The Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders may, at its option, create one or more copies of any Communication in the form of an imaged Electronic Record
(Electronic Copy), which shall be deemed created in the ordinary course of the such Persons business, and destroy the original paper document. All Communications in the form of an Electronic Record, including an
Electronic Copy, shall be considered an original for all purposes, and shall have the same legal effect, validity and enforceability as a paper record. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the Administrative Agent is under no
obligation to accept an Electronic Signature in any form or in any format unless expressly agreed to by the Administrative Agent pursuant to procedures approved by it; provided, further, without limiting the foregoing, (a) to the extent the
Administrative Agent has agreed to accept such Electronic Signature, the Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders shall be entitled to rely on any such Electronic Signature purportedly given by or on behalf of a Borrower without further
verification and (b) upon the request of the Administrative Agent or any Lender, any Electronic Signature shall be promptly followed by such manually executed counterpart. For purposes hereof, Electronic Record and
Electronic Signature shall have the meanings assigned to them, respectively, by 15 USC §7006, as it may be amended from time to time. 
  94 




10.11 Survival of Representations and Warranties. All representations and warranties
made hereunder and in any other Loan Document or other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and thereof. Such representations and warranties have been or
will be relied upon by the Administrative Agent and each Lender, regardless of any investigation made by the Administrative Agent or any Lender or on their behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or
knowledge of any Default at the time of any Loan, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as any Loan or any other Obligation hereunder shall remain unpaid or unsatisfied. 
10.12 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable,
(a) the legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall not be affected or impaired thereby and (b) the parties shall endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the
illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions. The invalidity of a provision in a particular jurisdiction shall
not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this Section 10.12, if and to the extent that the enforceability of any provisions in this
Agreement relating to Defaulting Lenders shall be limited by Debtor Relief Laws, as determined in good faith by the Administrative Agent, then such provisions shall be deemed to be in effect only to the extent not so limited. 
10.13 Replacement of Lenders. If the Company is entitled to replace a Lender pursuant to the provisions of
Section 3.06, or if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender or a Non-Consenting Lender or if any other circumstance exists hereunder that gives the Company the right to replace a Lender as
a party hereto, then the Company may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained
in, and consents required by, Section 10.06), all of its interests, rights (other than its existing rights to payments pursuant to Sections 3.01 and 3.04) and obligations under this Agreement and the related
Loan Documents to an Eligible Assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment), provided that: 
(a) The Company shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the assignment fee (if any) specified in
Section 10.06(b);  (b) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of
its Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under Section 3.05) from the assignee (to the extent of such
outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the applicable Borrower (in the case of all other amounts);  (c) in the case of any
such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 3.04 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 3.01, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation
or payments thereafter;  (d) such assignment does not conflict with Applicable Laws; and 
  95 




(e) in the case of an assignment resulting from a Lender becoming a Non-Consenting Lender, the applicable assignee shall have consented to the applicable amendment, waiver or consent. 
A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or
otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Company to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.  Each party hereto agrees
that (a) an assignment required pursuant to this Section 10.13 may be effected pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption executed by the Company, the Administrative Agent and the assignee and (b) the Lender
required to make such assignment need not be a party thereto in order for such assignment to be effective and shall be deemed to have consented to an be bound by the terms thereof; provided that, following the effectiveness of any such
assignment, the other parties to such assignment agree to execute and deliver such documents necessary to evidence such assignment as reasonably requested by the applicable Lender; provided, further, that any such documents shall be
without recourse to or warranty by the parties thereto.  Notwithstanding anything in this Section to the contrary, the Lender that acts as
the Administrative Agent may not be replaced hereunder except in accordance with the terms of Section 9.06. 
10.14 Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Etc. 
(a) GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS AND ANY CLAIMS, CONTROVERSY, DISPUTE OR CAUSE OF ACTION (WHETHER IN
CONTRACT OR TORT OR OTHERWISE) BASED UPON, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT (EXCEPT, AS TO ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT, AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH THEREIN) AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND THEREBY SHALL BE
GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.  (b) SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION. EACH BORROWER
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY AGREES THAT IT WILL NOT COMMENCE ANY ACTION, LITIGATION OR PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND OR DESCRIPTION, WHETHER IN LAW OR EQUITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR IN TORT OR OTHERWISE, AGAINST THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, ANY LENDER, OR
ANY RELATED PARTY OF THE FOREGOING IN ANY WAY RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTI

IS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER
THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PERSON HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PERSON WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER
AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION. 
10.16 No Advisory or Fiduciary Responsibility. In connection with all aspects of each transaction contemplated hereby (including in
connection with any amendment, waiver or other modification hereof or of any other Loan Document), each Borrower acknowledges and agrees, and acknowledges its Affiliates understanding, that: (i) (A) the arranging and other services
regarding this Agreement provided by the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers and the Lenders are arms-length commercial transactions between each Borrower and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the
Administrative 
  97 





Agent, the Arrangers and the Lenders, on the other hand, (B) each Borrower has consulted its own legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent it has deemed appropriate, and
(C) each Borrower is capable of evaluating, and understands and accepts, the terms, risks and conditions of the transactions contemplated hereby and by the other Loan Documents; (ii) (A) the Administrative Agent, each Arranger and each
Lender is and has been acting solely as a principal and, except as expressly agreed in writing by the relevant parties, has not been, is not, and will not be acting as an advisor, agent or fiduciary for any Borrower or any of its Affiliates, or any
other Person and (B) neither the Administrative Agent, nor any Arranger or any Lender, has any obligation to any Borrower or any of their respective Affiliates with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby except those obligations
expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents; and (iii) the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers and the Lenders and their respective Affiliates may be engaged in a broad range of transactions that involve interests that differ
from those of the Borrowers and their respective Affiliates, and neither the Administrative Agent, nor any Arranger or any Lender, has any obligation to disclose any of such interests to the Borrowers or their respective Affiliates. To the fullest
extent permitted by law, each Borrower hereby waives and releases any claims that it may have against the Administrative Agent, any Arranger or any Lender with respect to any breach or alleged breach of agency or fiduciary duty in connection with
any aspect of any transaction contemplated hereby.  10.17 Electronic Execution of Assignments and Certain Other Documents. The words
execute, execution, signed, signature, and words of like import in or related to any document to be signed in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including without
limitation Assignment and Assumptions, amendments or other modifications, Loan Notices, waivers and consents) shall be deemed to include electronic signatures, the electronic matching of assignment terms and contract formations on electronic
platforms approved by the Administrative Agent, or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping
system, as the case may be, to the extent and as provided for in any Applicable Law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act, or any other similar
state laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act; provided that notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary the Administrative Agent is under no obligation to agree to accept electronic signatures in any form or in
any format unless expressly agreed to by the Administrative Agent pursuant to procedures approved by it.  10.18 Judgment Currency.
If, for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court, it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder or any other Loan Document in one currency into another currency, the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal
banking procedures the Administrative Agent could purchase the first currency with such other currency on the Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is given. The obligation of each Borrower in respect of any such sum due from it to the
Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder or under the other Loan Documents shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency (the Judgment Currency) other than that in which such sum is denominated in accordance with the
applicable provisions of this Agreement (the Agreement Currency), be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, of any sum adjudged to
be so due in the Judgment Currency, the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase the Agreement Currency with the Judgment Currency. If the amount of the Agreement Currency so
purchased is less than the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent or any Lender from any Borrower in the Agreement Currency, such Borrower agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the
Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, against such loss. If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is greater than the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent or any Lender in such currency, the Administrative
Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, agrees to return the amount of any excess to such Borrower (or to any other Person who may be entitled thereto under Applicable Law). 
  98 




10.19 USA PATRIOT Act. Each Lender that is subject to the Act hereby notifies the
Borrowers that pursuant to the requirements of the Act, it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each Borrower, which information includes the name and address of each Borrower and other information that will allow
such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, to identify such Borrower in accordance with the Act. Each Borrower shall, promptly following a request by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, provide all documentation and other
information that the Administrative Agent or such Lender requests in order to comply with its ongoing obligations under applicable know your customer and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the Act. 
10.20 ENTIRE AGREEMENT. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS REPRESENT THE FINAL AGREEMENT AMONG THE PARTIES AND MAY NOT
BE CONTRADICTED BY EVIDENCE OF PRIOR, CONTEMPORANEOUS, OR SUBSEQUENT ORAL AGREEMENTS OF THE PARTIES. THERE ARE NO UNWRITTEN ORAL AGREEMENTS AMONG THE PARTIES.  
10.21 Acknowledgement and Consent to Bail-In of Affected Financial Institutions. Solely to the
extent any Lender that is an Affected Financial Institution is a party to this Agreement and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Loan Document or in any other agreement, arrangement or understanding among any such parties, each party
hereto acknowledges that any liability of any Lender that is an Affected Financial Institution arising under any Loan Document, to the extent such liability is unsecured, may be subject to the Write-Down and Conversion Powers of the applicable
Resolution Authority and agrees and consents to, and acknowledges and agrees to be bound by:  (a) the application of any Write-Down and
Conversion Powers by the applicable Resolution Authority to any such liabilities arising hereunder which may be payable to it by any Lender that is an Affected Financial Institution; and 
(b) the effects of any Bail-In Action on any such liability, including, if applicable: 
(i) a reduction in full or in part or cancellation of any such liability; 
(ii) a conversion of all, or a portion of, such liability into shares or other instruments of ownership in such Affected
Financial Institution, its parent undertaking, or a bridge institution that may be issued to it or otherwise conferred on it, and that such shares or other instruments of ownership will be accepted by it in lieu of any rights with respect to any
such liability under this Agreement or any other Loan Document; or  (iii) the variation of the terms of such liability in
connection with the exercise of the Write-Down and Conversion Powers of the applicable Resolution Authority.  10.22 Acknowledgement
Regarding Any Supported QFCs. To the extent that the Loan Documents provide support, through a guarantee or otherwise, for any Swap Contract or any other agreement or 

ll be effective to the same extent as the transfer would be effective under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the
Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support (and any such interest, obligation and rights in property) were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. In the event a Covered Party or a BHC Act Affiliate of a Covered
Party becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, Default Rights under the Loan Documents that might otherwise apply to such Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support that may be exercised against such Covered Party are
permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such Default Rights could be exercised under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and the Loan Documents were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United
States. Without limitation of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that rights and remedies of the parties with respect to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event affect the rights of any Covered Party with respect to a Supported QFC or any QFC
Credit Support.  (b) As used in this Section 10.22, the following terms have the following meanings: 
BHC Act Affiliate of a party means an affiliate (as such term is defined under, and interpreted
in accordance with, 12 U.S.C. 1841(k)) of such party.  Covered Entity means any of the following:
(i) a covered entity as that term is defined in, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R. § 252.82(b); (ii) a covered bank as that term is defined in, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R. §
47.3(b); or (iii) a covered FSI as that term is defined in, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R. § 382.2(b). 
Default Right has the meaning assigned to that term in, and shall be interpreted in accordance with, 12
C.F.R. §§ 252.81, 47.2 or 382.1, as applicable.  QFC has the meaning assigned to the term
qualified financial contract in, and shall be interpreted in accordance with, 12 U.S.C. 5390(c)(8)(D).  ARTICLE XI COMPANY
GUARANTY  11.01 Guaranty. The Company hereby unconditionally and absolutely guarantees the full and punctual payment
(whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise) of the principal of and interest on each Loan made to the Designated Borrowers (if any) pursuant to this Agreement, and the full and punctual payment of all other amounts payable by the
Designated Borrowers under this Agreement. Upon failure by any Designated Borrower to pay punctually any such amount, the Company shall forthwith on demand pay the amount not so paid at the place and in the manner specified in this Agreement. The
Company agrees that this guaranty is a continuing guaranty of payment and performance and not of collection.  11.02 Guaranty
Absolute. The obligations of the Company hereunder shall be unconditional and absolute and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, shall not be released, discharged or otherwise affected by: 
  100 




(a) any extension, renewal, settlement, compromise, waiver or release in respect of any
obligation of the Borrowers under any Loan Document, by operation of law or otherwise;  (b) any modification or amendment of or supplement
to this Agreement or any Note;  (c) any change in the corporate existence, structure or ownership of a Borrower, or any insolvency,
bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar proceeding affecting a Borrower or its assets or any resulting release or discharge of any obligation of a Borrower contained in any Loan Document; 
(d) the existence of any claim (other than a claim that the Obligations have been paid in full), set off or other rights which the Company may
have at any time against the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any other Person, whether in connection herewith or any unrelated transactions; provided that nothing herein shall prevent the assertion of any such claim by
separate suit or compulsory counterclaim;  (e) any invalidity or unenforceability relating to or against any Designated Borrower for any
reason of any Loan Document, or any provision of applicable law or regulation purporting to prohibit the payment by the Borrowers of the principal of or interest on any Loan or any other amount payable by it under this Agreement; or 
(f) any other act or omission to act or delay of any kind by the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any other Person or any
other circumstance whatsoever which might, but for the provisions of this paragraph, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of or defense to the Companys obligations hereunder (other than payment of the Obligations in full). 
11.03 Discharge Only Upon Payment in Full; Reinstatement in Certain Circumstances. The Companys obligations hereunder shall remain
in full force and effect until the Commitments shall have terminated and the principal of and interest on the Loans and all other amounts payable by the Company and the Borrowers under this Agreement shall have been paid in full. If at any time any
payment of the principal of or interest on any Loan or any other amount payable by the Borrowers under this Agreement is rescinded or must be otherwise restored or returned upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Borrowers or
otherwise, the Companys obligations hereunder with respect to such payment shall be reinstated at such time as though such payment had been due but not made at such time. 
11.04 Waiver by the Company. The Company irrevocably waives acceptance hereof, presentment, demand, protest and any notice not
provided for herein, as well as any requirement that at any time any action be taken by any Person against the Borrowers or any other Person as a condition to the Companys obligations hereunder. 
11.05 Subrogation. Upon making any payment with respect to the Borrowers hereunder, the Company shall be subrogated to the rights of the
payee against the Borrowers with respect to such payment; provided that the Company shall not enforce any payment by way of subrogation unless all amounts of principal of and interest on the Loans to the Borrowers and all other amounts payable by
the Borrowers under this Agreement have been paid in full.  11.06 Stay of Acceleration. If acceleration of the time for
payment of any amount payable by the Borrowers under this Agreement or its Notes is stayed upon insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Borrowers, all such amounts otherwise subject to acceleration under the terms of this Agreement shall
nonetheless be payable by the Company hereunder forthwith on demand by the Administrative Agent made at the request of the Required Lenders.
