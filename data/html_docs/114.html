Borrower shall reimburse Agent or such Lender, as applicable, for the amount of such payment by the end of the day on which Agent
or such Lender shall make such payment and (B) Borrowers shall be deemed to have immediately requested that Revolving Lenders make
a Revolving Loan, in a principal amount equal to the amount of such payment (but solely to the extent such Borrower shall have
failed to directly reimburse Agent or, with respect to Lender Letters of Credit, the applicable LC Issuer, for the amount of such
payment). Agent shall promptly notify Revolving Lenders of any such deemed request and each Revolving Lender hereby agrees to make
available to Agent not later than noon (Eastern time) on the Business Day following such notification from Agent such Revolving
Lender's Pro Rata Share of such Revolving Loan. Each Revolving Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to fund such
Revolving Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Loan described in the immediately preceding sentence, unaffected by any circumstance whatsoever,
including, without limitation, (x) the occurrence and continuance of a Default or Event of Default, (y) the fact that, whether
before or after giving effect to the making of any such Revolving Loan, the Revolving Loan Outstandings exceed or will exceed the
Revolving Loan Limit, and/or (z) the non-satisfaction of any conditions set forth in Section 7.2. Agent hereby agrees to apply
the gross proceeds of each Revolving Loan deemed made pursuant to this Section 2.5(c) in satisfaction of Borrowers' reimbursement
obligations arising pursuant to this Section 2.5(c). Borrowers shall pay interest, on demand, on all amounts so paid by Agent pursuant
to any Support Agreement or to any applicable Lender in honoring a draw request under any Lender Letter of Credit for each day
from the date of such payment until Borrowers reimburse Agent or the applicable Lender therefor (whether pursuant to clause (A)
or (B) of the first sentence of this subsection (c)) at a rate per annum equal to the sum of two percent (2%) plus the interest
rate applicable to Revolving Loans for such day.</p>

</font>Each Credit Party agrees that a notice received by it at least ten (10) days before the time of any intended public sale,
or the time after which any private sale or other disposition of the Collateral is to be made, shall be deemed to be reasonable
notice of such sale or other disposition. If permitted by applicable law, any perishable Collateral which threatens to speedily
decline in value or which is sold on a recognized market may be sold immediately by Agent without prior notice to Credit Parties.
At any sale or disposition of Collateral, Agent may (to the extent permitted by applicable law) purchase all or any part of the
Collateral, free from any right of redemption by Credit Parties, which right is hereby waived and released. Each Borrower covenants
and agrees not to interfere with or impose any obstacle to Agent's exercise of its rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral.
Agent shall have no obligation to clean-up or otherwise prepare the Collateral for sale. Agent may comply with any applicable state
or federal law requirements in connection with a disposition of the Collateral and compliance will not be considered to adversely
affect the commercial reasonableness of any sale of the Collateral. Agent may sell the Collateral without giving any warranties
as to the Collateral. Agent may specifically disclaim any warranties of title or the like. This procedure will not be considered
to adversely affect the commercial reasonableness of any sale of the Collateral. If Agent sells any of the Collateral upon credit,
Credit Parties will be credited only with payments actually made by the purchaser, received by Agent and applied to the indebtedness
of the purchaser. In the event the purchaser fails to pay for the Collateral, Agent may resell the Collateral and Credit Parties
shall be credited with the proceeds of the sale. Credit Parties shall remain liable for any deficiency if the proceeds of any sale
or disposition of the Collateral are insufficient to pay all Obligations.</p>
