Credit Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.2 by the time specified in this Section 2.2, the Swingline Lender shall be entitled to recover from such Revolving Credit Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the Swingline Lender at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Federal Funds Rate, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Swingline Lender in connection with the foregoing.  If such Revolving Credit Lender pays such amount (with interest and fees as aforesaid), the amount so paid shall constitute such Revolving Credit Lenders Revolving Credit Loan or Swingline Participation Amount, as the case may be.  A certificate of the Swingline Lender submitted to any Revolving Credit Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (v) shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
 
(c)                                  Defaulting Lenders.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, this Section 2.2 shall be subject to the terms and conditions of Section 5.14 and Section 5.15.
 
SECTION 2.3                                        Procedure for Advances of Revolving Credit Loans and Swingline Loans.
 
(a)                                 Requests for Borrowing.  The Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent irrevocable prior written notice substantially in the form of Exhibit B (a Notice of Borrowing) not later than 11:00 a.m. (i) on the same Business Day as each Base Rate Loan and each Swingline Loan and (ii) at least three (3) Business Days before each LIBOR Rate Loan, of its intention to borrow, specifying (A) the date of such borrowing, which shall be a Business Day, (B) the amount of such borrowing, which shall be, (x) with respect to Base Rate Loans (other than Swingline Loans) in an aggregate principal amount of $1,000,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof, (y) with respect to LIBOR Rate Loans in an aggregate principal amount of $1,000,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof and (z) with respect to Swingline Loans in an aggregate principal amount of $500,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof, (C) whether such Loan is to be a Revolving Credit Loan or Swingline Loan, (D) in the case of a Revolving Credit Loan whether the Loans are to be LIBOR Rate Loans or Base Rate Loans, and (E) in the case of a LIBOR Rate Loan, the duration of the Interest Period applicable thereto; provided that if the Borrower wishes to request LIBOR Rate Loans having an Interest Period of twelve (12) months in duration, such notice must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. four (4) Business Days prior to the requested date of such borrowing, whereupon the Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice to the Revolving Credit Lenders of such request and determine whether the requested Interest Period is acceptable to all of them.  If the Borrower fails to specify a type of Loan in a Notice of Borrowing, then the applicable Loans shall be made as Base Rate Loans.  If the Borrower requests a borrowing of LIBOR Rate Loans in any such Notice of Borrowing, but fails to specify an Interest Period, it will be deemed to have specified an Interest Period of one month.  A Notice of Borrowing received after 11:00 a.m. shall be deemed received on the next Business Day.  The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Revolving Credit Lenders of each Notice of Borrowing.
 
(b)                                 Disbursement of Revolving Credit and Swingline Loans.  Not later than 1:00 p.m. on the proposed borrowing date, (i) each Revolving Credit Lender (so long as, in respect of Base Rate Loans, the Administrative Agent has provided such Revolving Credit Lender with a copy of the Notice of Borrowing by no later than 11:00 a.m. on the proposed borrowing date) will make available to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Borrower, at the office of the Administrative Agent in funds immediately available to the Administrative Agent, such Revolving Credit Lenders Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage of the Revolving Credit Loans to be made on such borrowing date and (ii) the Swingline Lender will make available to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Borrower, at the office of the Administrative Agent in funds immediately available to the Administrative Agent, the Swingline Loans to be made on such borrowing date.  The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to 
 
44





 
the Borrower (and the Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent to disburse the proceeds of each borrowing requested pursuant to this Section) in immediately available funds by crediting or wiring such proceeds to the deposit account of the Borrower identified in the most recent notice substantially in the form attached as Exhibit C (a Notice of Account Designation) delivered by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent or as may be otherwise agreed upon by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent from time to time.  Subject to Section 5.7 hereof, the Administrative Agent shall not be obligated to disburse the portion of the proceeds of any Revolving Credit Loan requested pursuant to this Section to the extent that any Revolving Credit Lender has not made available to the Administrative Agent its Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage of such Loan.  Revolving Credit Loans to be made for the purpose of refunding Swingline Loans shall be made by the Revolving Credit Lenders as provided in Section 2.2(b).
 
SECTION 2.4                                        Repayment and Prepayment of Revolving Credit and Swingline Loans.
 
(a)                                 Repayment on Termination Date.  The Borrower hereby agrees to repay the outstanding principal amount of: (i) all Revolving Credit Loans in full on the Revolving Credit Maturity Date; and (ii) all Swingline Loans in accordance with Section 2.2(b) (but, in any event, no later than the Revolving Credit Maturity Date), together, in each case, with all accrued but unpaid interest thereon.
 
(b)                                 Mandatory Prepayments.  If at any time the Revolving Credit Outstandings exceed the Revolving Credit Commitment, the Borrower agrees to repay immediately upon notice from the Administrative Agent, by payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Revolving Credit Lenders, such portions of the Extensions of Credit which equals the amount of such excess with each such repayment applied: first, to the principal amount of outstanding Swingline Loans; second to the principal amount of outstanding Revolving Credit Loans; and third, with respect to any Letters of Credit then outstanding, a payment of Cash Collateral into a Cash Collateral account opened by the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Revolving Credit Lenders, in an amount equal to such excess (such Cash Collateral to be applied in accordance with Section 10.2(b)).
 
(c)                                  Optional Prepayments.  The Borrower may at any time and from time to time prepay Revolving Credit Loans and Swingline Loans, in whole or in part, with irrevocable prior written notice to the Administrative Agent substantially in the form attached as Exhibit D (a Notice of Prepayment) given not later than 11:00 a.m. (i) on the same Business Day as the prepayment of each Base Rate Loan and each Swingline Loan (or such later time as approved by the Administrative Agent) and (ii) at least three (3) Business Days before the prepayment of each LIBOR Rate Loan (or such later time as approved by the Administrative Agent), specifying the date and amount of prepayment and whether the prepayment is of LIBOR Rate Loans, Base Rate Loans, Swingline Loans or a combination thereof, and, if of a combination thereof, the amount allocable to each.  Upon receipt of such notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Revolving Credit Lender.  If any such notice is given, the amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date set forth in such notice.  Partial prepayments shall be in an aggregate amount of $1,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof with respect to Base Rate Loans (other than Swingline Loans), $1,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof with respect to LIBOR Rate Loans, and $500,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof with respect to Swingline Loans.  A Notice of Prepayment received after 11:00 a.m. shall be deemed received on the next Business Day.  Each such repayment shall be accompanied by any amount required to be paid pursuant to Section 5.9 hereof.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Notice of a Prepayment delivered by the Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities or other transactions or events specified therein, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied (provided that the failure of such condition to be satisfied shall not relieve the Borrower from its obligations in respect thereof under Section 5.9).
 
45





 
(d)                                 Prepayment of Excess Proceeds.  In the event proceeds remain after the prepayments of Term Loan Facility pursuant to Section 4.4(b), the amount of such excess proceeds shall be used on the date of the required prepayment under Section 4.4(b) to prepay the outstanding principal amount of the Revolving Credit Loans, without a corresponding reduction of the Revolving Credit Commitment, with remaining proceeds, if any, refunded to the Borrower.
 
(e)                                  Limitation on Prepayment of LIBOR Rate Loans.  The Borrower may not prepay any LIBOR Rate Loan on any day other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto unless such prepayment is accompanied by any amount required to be paid pursuant to Section 5.9 hereof.
 
(f)                                   Hedge Agreements.  No repayment or prepayment of the Loans pursuant to this Section shall affect any of the Borrowers obligations under any Hedge Agreement entered into with respect to the Loans.
 
SECTION 2.5                                        Permanent Reduction of the Revolving Credit Commitment.
 
(a)                                 Voluntary Reduction.  The Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time, upon at least five (5) Business Days prior irrevocable written notice to the Administrative Agent, to permanently reduce, without premium or penalty: (i) the entire Revolving Credit Commitment at any time; or (ii) portions of the Revolving Credit Commitment, from time to time, in an aggregate principal amount not less than $1,000,000 or any whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof.  Any reduction of the Revolving Credit Commitment shall be applied to the Revolving Credit Commitment of each Revolving Credit Lender according to its Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage.  All Commitment Fees accrued until the effective date of any termination of the Revolving Credit Commitment shall be paid on the effective date of such termination.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, any notice to reduce the Revolving Credit Commitment delivered by the Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities or other transactions or events specified therein, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied (provided that the failure of such condition to be satisfied shall not relieve the Borrower from its obligations in respect thereof under Section 5.9).
 
(b)                                 Corresponding Payment.  Each permanent reduction permitted pursuant to this Section shall be accompanied by a payment of principal sufficient to reduce the aggregate outstanding Revolving Credit Loans, Swingline Loans and L/C Obligations, as applicable, after such reduction to the Revolving Credit Commitment as so reduced, and if the aggregate amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit exceeds the Revolving Credit Commitment as so reduced, the Borrower shall be required to deposit Cash Collateral in a Cash Collateral account opened by the Administrative Agent in an amount equal to such excess.  Such Cash Collateral shall be applied in accordance with Section 10.2(b).  Any reduction of the Revolving Credit Commitment to zero shall be accompanied by payment of all outstanding Revolving Credit Loans and Swingline Loans (and furnishing of Cash Collateral satisfactory to the Administrative Agent for all L/C Obligations) and shall result in the termination of the Revolving Credit Commitment and the Swingline Commitment and the Revolving Credit Facility.  If the reduction of the Revolving Credit Commitment requires the repayment of any LIBOR Rate Loan, such repayment shall be accompanied by any amount required to be paid pursuant to Section 5.9 hereof.
 
SECTION 2.6                                        Termination of Revolving Credit Facility.  The Revolving Credit Facility and the Revolving Credit Commitments shall terminate on the Revolving Credit Maturity Date.

48





 
Revolving Credit Loan or otherwise in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, such L/C Participant shall pay to such Issuing Lender upon demand, in Dollars, at such Issuing Lenders address for notices specified herein an amount equal to such L/C Participants Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage of the Dollar Equivalent of the amount of such draft, or any part thereof, which is not so reimbursed.
 
(b)                                 Upon becoming aware of any amount required to be paid by any L/C Participant to any Issuing Lender pursuant to Section 3.4(a) in respect of any unreimbursed portion of any payment made by such Issuing Lender under any Letter of Credit, issued by it, such Issuing Lender shall notify the Administrative Agent of such unreimbursed amount and the Administrative Agent shall notify each L/C Participant (with a copy to the applicable Issuing Lender) of the amount and due date of such required payment and such L/C Participant shall pay to the Administrative Agent (which, in turn shall pay such Issuing Lender) the amount specified on the applicable due date.  If any such amount is paid to such Issuing Lender after the date such payment is due, such L/C Participant shall pay to such Issuing Lender on demand, in addition to such amount, the product of: (i) such amount; times (ii) the Overnight Rate as determined by the Administrative Agent during the period from and including the date such payment is due to the date on which such payment is immediately available to such Issuing Lender; times (iii) a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days that elapse during such period and the denominator of which is 360.  A certificate of such Issuing Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this Section shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.  With respect to payment to such Issuing Lender of the unreimbursed amounts described in this Section, if the L/C Participants receive notice that any such payment is due (A) prior to 1:00 p.m. on any Business Day, such payment shall be due that Business Day, and (B) after 1:00 p.m. on any Business Day, such payment shall be due on the following Business Day.
 
(c)                                  Whenever, at any time after any Issuing Lender has made payment under any Letter of Credit issued by it and has received from any L/C Participant its Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage of such payment in accordance with this Section, such Issuing Lender receives any payment related to such Letter of Credit (whether directly from the Borrower or otherwise), or any payment of interest on account thereof, such Issuing Lender will promptly distribute to such L/C Participant its pro rata share thereof; provided, that in the event that any such payment received by such Issuing Lender shall be required to be returned by such Issuing Lender, such L/C Participant shall promptly return in Dollars to such Issuing Lender the portion thereof previously distributed by such Issuing Lender to it.
 
(d)                                 Each L/C Participants obligation to make the Revolving Credit Loans referred to in Section  3.4(b) and to purchase participating interests pursuant to Section 3.4(a) shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (i) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right that such Revolving Credit Lender or the Borrower may have against the Issuing Lender, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (ii) with respect to the obligation to purchase participating interests pursuant to Section 3.4(a), the occurrence or continuance of a Default or an Event of Default or the failure to satisfy any of the other conditions specified in Article VI, (iii) any adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise) of the Borrower, (iv) any breach of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by the Borrower, any other Credit Party or any other Revolving Credit Lender or (v) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing.
 
SECTION 3.5                                        Reimbursement Obligation of the Borrower.  In the event of any drawing under any Letter of Credit, the Borrower agrees to reimburse (either with the proceeds of a Revolving Credit Loan as provided for in this Section or with funds from other sources), in same day funds, in Dollars, the applicable Issuing Lender on each date on which such Issuing Lender notifies the Borrower of the date and amount of a draft paid by it under any Letter of Credit for the Dollar Equivalent of the amount of (a) such draft so paid and (b) any amounts referred to in Section 3.3(c) incurred by such 
 
49





 
Issuing Lender in connection with such payment.  Unless the Borrower shall immediately notify such Issuing Lender that the Borrower intends to reimburse such Issuing Lender for such drawing from other sources or funds, the Borrower shall be deemed to have timely given a Notice of Borrowing to the Administrative Agent requesting that the Revolving Credit Lenders make a Revolving Credit Loan as a Base Rate Loan on the applicable repayment date in the Dollar Equivalent of the amount of (i) such draft so paid and (ii) any amounts referred to in Section 3.3(c) incurred by such Issuing Lender in connection with such payment, and, subject to satisfaction or waiver of the conditions specified in Section 6.02, the Revolving Credit Lenders shall make a Revolving Credit Loan as a Base Rate Loan in such amount, the proceeds of which shall be applied to reimburse such Issuing Lender for the amount of the related drawing and such fees and expenses.  Each Revolving Credit Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to fund a Revolving Credit Loan in accordance with this Section to reimburse such Issuing Lender for any draft paid under a Letter of Credit issued by it is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including, without limitation, non-satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 2.3(a), except for the failure to satisfy any of the conditions specified in Section 6.02 which have not been waived.  If the Borrower has elected to pay the amount of such drawing with funds from other sources and shall fail to reimburse such Issuing Lender as provided above, or if the amount of such drawing is not fully refunded through a Base Rate Loan as provided above, the unreimbursed amount of such drawing shall bear interest at the rate which would be payable on any outstanding Base Rate Loans which were then overdue from the date such amounts become payable (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) until payment in full.
 
SECTION 3.6                                        Obligations Absolute.  The Borrowers obligations under this Article III (including, without limitation, the Reimbursement Obligation) shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances and irrespective of any set off, counterclaim or defense to payment which the Borrower may have or have had against the applicable Issuing Lender or any beneficiary of a Letter of Credit or any other Person.  The Borrower also agrees that the applicable Issuing Lender and the L/C Participants shall not be responsible for, and the Borrowers Reimbursement Obligation under Section 3.5 shall not be affected by, among other things, the validity or genuineness of documents or of any endorsements thereon, even though such documents shall in fact prove to be invalid, fraudulent or forged, or any dispute between or among the Borrower and any beneficiary of any Letter of Credit or any other party to which such Letter of Credit may be transferred or any claims whatsoever of the Borrower against any beneficiary of such Letter of Credit or any such transferee, or any adverse change in the relevant exchange rates or in the availability of the relevant Alternative Currency to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or in the relevant currency markets generally.  Any Issuing Lender shall not be liable for any error, omission, interruption or delay in transmission, dispatch or delivery of any message or advice, however transmitted, in connection with any Letter of Credit issued by it, except for errors or omissions caused by such Issuing Lenders gross negligence or willful misconduct, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final nonappealable judgment.  The Borrower agrees that any action taken or omitted by any Issuing Lender under or in connection with any Letter of Credit issued by it or the related drafts or documents, if done in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct shall be binding on the Borrower and shall not result in any liability of such Issuing Lender or any L/C Participant to the Borrower.  The responsibility of any Issuing Lender to the Borrower in connection with any draft presented for payment under any Letter of Credit issued by it shall, in addition to any payment obligation expressly provided for in such Letter of Credit, be limited to determining that the documents (including each draft) delivered under such Letter of Credit in connection with such presentment substantially conforms to the requirements under such Letter of Credit.
 
SECTION 3.7                                        Effect of Letter of Credit Application.  To the extent that any provision of any Letter of Credit Application related to any Letter of Credit is inconsistent with the provisions of this Article III, the provisions of this Article III shall apply.

(a)                                 Any Lender may at any time resign from its role as an Issuing Lender hereunder upon not less than thirty (30) days prior notice to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (or such shorter period of time as may be acceptable to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent).
 
(b)                                 Any resigning Issuing Lender shall retain all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of an Issuing Lender hereunder with respect to all Letters of Credit issued by it that are outstanding as of the effective date of its resignation as an Issuing Lender and all L/C Obligations with respect thereto (including, without limitation, the right to require the Revolving Credit Lenders to take such actions as are required under Section 3.4).  Without limiting the foregoing, upon the resignation of a Lender as an Issuing Lender hereunder, the Borrower may, or at the request of such resigned Issuing Lender the Borrower shall, use commercially reasonable efforts to, arrange for one or more of the other Issuing Lenders to issue Letters of Credit hereunder in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, issued by such resigned Issuing Lender and outstanding at the time of such resignation, or make other arrangements satisfactory to the resigned Issuing Lender to effectively cause another Issuing Lender to assume the obligations of the resigned Issuing Lender with respect to any such Letters of Credit.
 
SECTION 3.9                                        Reporting of Letter of Credit Information and L/C Commitment.  At any time that there is an Issuing Lender that is not also the financial institution acting as Administrative Agent, then: (a) on the last Business Day of each calendar month; (b) on each date that a Letter of Credit is amended, terminated or otherwise expires; (c) on each date that a Letter of Credit is issued or the expiry date of a Letter of Credit is extended; and (d) upon the request of the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Lender (or, in the case of clauses (b), (c) or (d) of this Section, the applicable Issuing Lender) shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a report setting forth in form and detail reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent information (including, without limitation, any reimbursement, Cash Collateral, or termination in respect of Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender) with respect to each Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender that is outstanding hereunder.  In addition, each Issuing Lender shall provide notice to the Administrative Agent of its L/C Commitment, or any change thereto, promptly upon it becoming an Issuing Lender or making any change to its L/C Commitment.  No failure on the part of any Issuing Lender to provide such information pursuant to this Section 3.9 shall limit the obligations of the Borrower or any Revolving Credit Lender hereunder with respect to its reimbursement and participation obligations hereunder.
 
SECTION 3.10                                 Letters of Credit Issued for Subsidiaries.  Notwithstanding that a Letter of Credit issued or outstanding hereunder is in support of any obligations of, or is for the account of, a Subsidiary, the Borrower shall be obligated to reimburse, or to cause the applicable Subsidiary to reimburse, the applicable Issuing Lender hereunder for any and all drawings under such Letter of Credit.  The Borrower hereby acknowledges that the issuance of Letters of Credit for the account of any of its Subsidiaries inures to the benefit of the Borrower and that the Borrowers business derives substantial benefits from the businesses of such Subsidiaries.

(a)                                 Initial Term Loan.  The Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent an irrevocable Notice of Borrowing prior to 11:00 a.m. on the Closing Date (or such later time as approved by the Administrative Agent) requesting that the Term Loan Lenders make the Initial Term Loan as a Base Rate Loan on such date (provided that the Borrower may request, no later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date (or such later time as approved by the Administrative Agent), that the Lenders make the Initial Term Loan as a LIBOR Rate Loan if the Borrower has delivered to the Administrative Agent a letter in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent indemnifying the Lenders in the manner set forth in Section 5.9 of this Agreement).  Upon receipt of such Notice of Borrowing from the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Term Loan Lender thereof.  Not later than 1:00 p.m. on the Closing Date, each Term Loan Lender will make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Borrower, at the Administrative Agents Office in immediately available funds, the amount of such Initial Term Loan to be made by such Term Loan Lender on the Closing Date.  The Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent to disburse the proceeds of the Initial Term Loan in immediately available funds by wire transfer to such Person or Persons as may be designated by the Borrower in writing.
 
SECTION 4.3                                        Repayment of Term Loans.
 
(a)                                 Initial Term Loan.  The Borrower shall repay the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Initial Term Loan in consecutive quarterly installments on the last Business Day of each of March, June, September and December of each calendar year, commencing with the first full quarter ending after the Closing Date, as set forth below (except as the amounts of individual installments may be adjusted pursuant to Section 4.4 hereof):

Term Loan   Maturity Date 

  

Remaining outstanding principal balance 

    
 
If not sooner paid, the Initial Term Loan shall be paid in full, together with accrued interest thereon, on the Term Loan Maturity Date.
 
SECTION 4.4                                        Prepayments of Term Loans.
 
(a)                                 Optional Prepayments.  The Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time, without premium or penalty (except as set forth in Section 5.9), to prepay the Term Loans, in whole or in part, upon delivery to the Administrative Agent of a Notice of Prepayment not later than 11:00 a.m.: (i) on the same Business Day with respect to each Base Rate Loan (or such later time as approved by the Administrative Agent); and (ii) at least three (3) Business Days before with respect to each LIBOR Rate Loan (or such later time as approved by the Administrative Agent), specifying the date and amount of repayment, whether the repayment is of LIBOR Rate Loans or Base Rate Loans or a combination thereof, and if a combination thereof, the amount allocable to each.  Each optional prepayment of the Term Loans hereunder shall be in an aggregate principal amount of at least $1,000,000 or any whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and shall be applied, as directed by the Borrower, to the outstanding principal installments of any Series of Term Loans.  Each repayment shall be accompanied by any amount required to be paid pursuant to Section 5.9 hereof.  A Notice of Prepayment received after 11:00 a.m. shall be deemed received on the next Business Day.  The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the applicable Term Loan Lenders of each Notice of Prepayment.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Notice of Prepayment delivered by the Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities or other transactions or events specified therein, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied (provided that the failure of such condition to be satisfied shall not relieve the Borrower from its obligations in respect thereof under Section 5.9).
 
(b)                                 Mandatory Prepayments.
 
(i)                                     Debt Issuances.  The Borrower shall make mandatory principal prepayments of the Loans in the manner set forth in clause (v) below in an amount equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the aggregate Net Cash Proceeds from any Debt Issuance not otherwise permitted pursuant to Section 9.1.  Such prepayment shall be made within three (3) Business Days after the date of receipt of the Net Cash Proceeds of any such Debt Issuance.
 
(ii)                                  Asset Dispositions and Insurance and Condemnation Events.  Subject to Section 4.4(b)(iv), the Borrower shall make mandatory principal prepayments of the Loans in the manner set forth in clause (v) below in amounts equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the aggregate Net Cash Proceeds from: (A) any Asset Disposition (other than any Asset Disposition permitted pursuant to, and in accordance with, clauses (a), (b), (c), (d), (f), (g), (h), (i), (j), (k), (l) and  (m) of Section 9.5); or (B) any Insurance and Condemnation Event; provided that, (1) no mandatory prepayment shall be required under this clause (ii) with respect to any individual or series of related Asset Dispositions or Insurance and Condemnation Events that results in Net Cash Proceeds not in excess of $5,000,000 for such single event or series of related events and (2) no mandatory prepayment shall be required in any Fiscal Year pursuant to this clause (ii) until the date on which the Net Cash Proceeds required to be applied as mandatory prepayments pursuant to this clause (ii) in such Fiscal Year shall exceed $10,000,000 (and thereafter only Net Cash Proceeds in excess of such amount shall be required to be applied to mandatory prepayments
 
53





 
pursuant to this clause (ii)).  Such prepayments shall be made within three (3) Business Days after the date of receipt of the Net Cash Proceeds; provided that, so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds, no prepayment shall be required under this Section 4.4(b)(ii) with respect to such portion of such Net Cash Proceeds that the Borrower shall have, on or prior to such date given written notice to the Administrative Agent of its intent to reinvest in accordance with Section 4.4(b)(iii) ; provided, however, that any Lender may elect in its sole discretion, by delivering a written notice to the Administrative Agent promptly after receiving notice from the Administrative Agent of any such prepayment pursuant to this Section 4.4(b)(ii), to forego its ratable portion of any such prepayment, in which case such declined portion of the prepayment may be retained by the Borrower.
 
(iii)                               Reinvestment Option.  With respect to any Net Cash Proceeds realized or received with respect to any Asset Disposition or any Insurance and Condemnation Event by any Credit Party of any Subsidiary thereof (in each case, to the extent not excluded pursuant to Section 4.4(b)(ii)), at the option of the Borrower, the Credit Parties or any of their Subsidiaries may reinvest all or any portion of such Net Cash Proceeds in assets used or useful for the business of the Credit Parties and their Subsidiaries within: (x) twelve (12) months following receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds; or (y) if such Credit Party or Subsidiary, within twelve (12) months following receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds, enters into a bona fide commitment to reinvest such Net Cash Proceeds, within eighteen (18) months following receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds; provided that if any Net Cash Proceeds have not been so reinvested within such twelve (12) months or eighteen (18) months, as applicable, an amount equal to such Net Cash Proceeds that have not been so reinvested shall be applied to the repayment of the Loans pursuant to Section 4.4(b) within three (3) Business Days after the end of such twelve (12) twelve months or eighteen (18) months, as applicable.  Pending the final application of any such Net Cash Proceeds, the

            Restriction on Mandatory Prepayments.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 4.4(b), to the extent that any or all of the Net Cash Proceeds of a Foreign Disposition or the Net Cash Proceeds of any Foreign Casualty Event is prohibited or delayed by applicable local law or organizational document restrictions (including financial assistance, corporate benefit, restrictions on dividends and the fiduciary and statutory duties of directors of the applicable Foreign Subsidiaries and as a result of minority ownership in the applicable Foreign Subsidiaries) from being repatriated to the United States, an amount equal to the portion of such Net Cash Proceeds so affected will not be required to be applied to make a prepayment of the Loans at the time provided in this Section 4.4(b). Instead, such amounts may be retained so long as, but only so long as, the applicable local law or organizational document restriction will not permit repatriation to the United States (the Borrower hereby agreeing to cause the applicable Foreign Subsidiary for a period of one year after the occurrence of the applicable Foreign Disposition or Foreign Casualty Event to promptly take all commercially reasonable actions reasonably required by the applicable local law to permit such repatriation), and once such repatriation of any such affected Net Cash Proceeds is permitted under the applicable local law, such repatriation will be promptly (and in any event not later than three (3) Business Days after such repatriation) applied (net of additional taxes payable or reserved against as a result thereof) to the repayment of the Loans pursuant to this Section 4.4(b).  In addition, notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 4.4(b), to the extent the Borrower has reasonably determined in good faith that repatriation of any or all of the Net Cash Proceeds of any Foreign Disposition or any Foreign Casualty Event would have an adverse tax consequence (taking into account any foreign tax credit or benefit received in connection with
 
54





 
such repatriation), then, to the extent that such adverse tax consequence is not directly attributable to actions taken by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries with the intent of avoiding or reducing any mandatory prepayment otherwise required, the Borrower shall not be required to make a prepayment with an amount equal to such portion of Net Cash Proceeds as required pursuant to this Section 4.4(b).  Instead, such amounts may be retained so long as, but only so long as, repatriation of the Net Cash Proceeds would have an adverse tax consequence (the Borrower hereby agreeing to use commercially reasonable efforts for a period of one year after such Foreign Disposition or Foreign Casualty Event to reduce or eliminate such adverse tax consequence) and once such repatriation would not have an adverse tax consequence, an amount equal to such Net Cash Proceeds will be promptly (and in any event not later than three (3) Business Days after such repatriation would not have an adverse tax consequence) applied (net of additional taxes payable or reserved against as a result thereof) to the repayment of the Loans pursuant to this Section 4.4(b).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Borrower agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts for a period of one year after the occurrence of the applicable Foreign Disposition or Foreign Casualty Event to use other cash resources of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (subject to the limitations set forth in this clause (iv)) to make any such mandatory prepayment required by this Section 4.4(b) and (ii) the limitations on the Borrowers obligation to make mandatory prepayments provided by this clause (iv) shall only apply if at the time a mandatory prepayment would otherwise be required due to such Foreign Disposition or Foreign Casualty Event, the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio, calculated on a Pro Forma Basis as of the most recently ended fiscal quarter for which financial statements are required to have been delivered pursuant to Section 8.1(a) or (b), is less than 2.50 to 1.00.
 
(v)                                 Notice; Manner of Payment.  Upon the occurrence of any event triggering the prepayment requirement under clauses (i) and (ii) above, the Borrower shall promptly deliver a Notice of Prepayment to the Administrative Agent and upon receipt of such notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly so notify the Lenders.  Each prepayment of the Loans under this Section shall be applied as follows:  first, ratably between each Series of Term Loans (unless otherwise agreed by the Lenders of the applicable Series of Term Loans (provided that in no event shall the Initial Term Loans receive less than their ratable share)) to reduce in inverse order of maturity the remaining scheduled principal installments of each such Series pursuant to Section 4.3; and second, to the extent of any excess, to repay the Revolving Credit Loans pursuant to Section 2.4(d), without a corresponding reduction in the Revolving Credit Commitment.
 
(vi)                              Prepayment of LIBOR Rate Loans.  Each prepayment shall be accompanied by any amount required to be paid pursuant to Section 5.9; provided that, so long as no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, if any prepayment of LIBOR Rate Loans is required to be made under this Section 4.4(b) prior to the last day of the Interest Period therefor, in lieu of making any payment pursuant to this Section 4.4(b) in respect of any such LIBOR Rate Loan prior to the last day of the Interest Period therefor, the Borrower may, in its sole discretion, deposit an amount sufficient to make any such prepayment otherwise required to be made thereunder together with accrued interest to the last day of such Interest Period into an account held at, and subject to the sole control of, the Administrative Agent until the last day of such Interest Period, at which time the Administrative Agent shall be authorized (without any further action by or notice to or from the Borrower or any other Credit Party) to apply such amount to the prepayment of such Term Loans in accordance with this Section 4.4(b).  Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Default or Event of Default, the Administrative Agent shall also be authorized (without any further action by or notice to or from the Borrower or any other Credit Party) to apply such amount to the prepayment of the outstanding Term Loans in accordance with the relevant provisions of this Section 4.4(b).
 
55

 




 
(vii)                           No Reborrowings.  Amounts applied to the repayment or prepayment of the Term Loans pursuant to this Section may not be reborrowed.
 
ARTICLE V
 
GENERAL LOAN PROVISIONS
 
SECTION 5.1                                        Interest.
 
(a)                                 Interest Rate Options.  Subject to the provisions of this Section, at the election of the Borrower: (i) Revolving Credit Loans and the Term Loans shall bear interest at: (A) the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin; or (B) the LIBOR Rate plus the Applicable Margin (provided that the LIBOR Rate shall not be available until three (3) Business Days (or four (4) Business Days with respect to a LIBOR Rate based on a twelve month Interest Period) after the Closing Date unless the Borrower has delivered to the Administrative Agent a letter in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent indemnifying the Lenders in the manner set forth in Section 5.9 of this Agreement); and (ii) any Swingline Loan shall bear interest at the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin.  The Borrower shall select the rate of interest and Interest Period, if any, applicable to any Loan at the time a Notice of Borrowing is given or at the time a Notice of Conversion/Continuation is given pursuant to Section 5.2.
 
(b)                                 Default Rate.  Subject to Section 10.3: (i) immediately upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default under Section 10.1(a), (b), (h) or (i); or (ii) at the election of the Required Lenders (or of the Administrative Agent at the direction of the Required Lenders), upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any other Event of Default: (A) the Borrower shall no longer have the option to request LIBOR Rate Loans, Swingline Loans or Letters of Credit; (B) all outstanding LIBOR Rate Loans shall bear interest at a rate per annum of two percent (2%) in excess of the rate (including the Applicable Margin) then applicable to LIBOR Rate Loans until the end of the applicable Interest Period and thereafter at a rate equal to two percent (2%) in excess of the rate (including the Applicable Margin) then applicable to Base Rate Loans; (C) all outstanding Base Rate Loans and other Obligations arising hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to two percent (2%) in excess of the rate (including the Applicable Margin) then applicable to Base Rate Loans or such other Obligations arising hereunder or under any other Loan Document; and (D) all accrued and unpaid interest shall be due and payable on demand of the Administrative Agent.  Interest shall continue to accrue on the Obligations after the filing by or against the Borrower of any petition seeking any relief in bankruptcy or under any Debtor Relief Law.
 
(c)                                  Interest Payment and Computation.  Interest on each Base Rate Loan shall be due and payable in arrears on the last Business Day of each calendar quarter commencing with the last Business Day of the first calendar quarter ending after the Closing Date; and interest on each LIBOR Rate Loan shall be due and payable on the last day of each Interest Period applicable thereto, and if such Interest Period extends over three (3) months, at the end of each three (3) month interval during such Interest Period.  All computations of interest for Base Rate Loans when the Base Rate is determined by the Prime Rate shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed.  All other computations of fees and interest provided hereunder shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed (which results in more fees or interest, as applicable, being paid than if computed on the basis of a 365/366-day year).
 
(d)                                 Maximum Rate.  In no contingency or event whatsoever shall the aggregate of all amounts deemed interest under this Agreement charged or collected pursuant to the terms of this Agreement exceed the highest rate permissible under any Applicable Law which a court of competent
 
56





 
jurisdiction shall, in a final determination, deem applicable hereto.  In the event that such a court determines that the Lenders have charged or received interest hereunder in excess of the highest applicable rate, the rate in effect hereunder shall automatically be reduced to the maximum rate permitted by Applicable Law and the Lenders shall at the Administrative Agents option: (i) promptly refund to the Borrower any interest received by the Lenders in excess of the maximum lawful rate; or (ii) apply such excess to the principal balance of the Obligations.  It is the intent hereof that the Borrower not pay or contract to pay, and that neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender receive or contract to receive, directly or indirectly in any manner whatsoever, interest in excess of that which may be paid by the Borrower under Applicable Law.
 
SECTION 5.2                                        Notice and Manner of Conversion or Continuation of Loans.  Provided that no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is then continuing, the Borrower shall have the option to: (a) convert at any time following the third (3rd) Business Day after the Closing Date all or any portion of any outstanding Base Rate Loans (other than Swingline Loans) in a principal amount equal to $1,000,000 or any whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof into one or more LIBOR Rate Loans; and (b) upon the expiration of any Interest Period: (i) convert all or any part of its outstanding LIBOR Rate Loans in a principal amount equal to $1,000,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof into Base Rate Loans (other than Swingline Loans); or (ii) continue such LIBOR Rate Loans as LIBOR Rate Loans.  Whenever the Borrower desires to convert or continue Loans as provided above, the Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent irrevocable prior written notice in the form attached as Exhibit E (a Notice of Conversion/Continuation) not later than 11:00 a.m. three (3) Business Days before the day on which a proposed conversion or continuation of such Loan is to be effective specifying: (A) the Loans to be converted or continued, and, in the case of any LIBOR Rate Loan to be converted or continued, the last day of the Interest Period therefor; (B) the effective date of such conversion or continuation (which shall be a Business Day); (C) the principal amount of such Loans to be converted or continued; and (D) the Interest Period to be applicable to such converted or continued LIBOR Rate Loan; provided that if the Borrower wishes to request LIBOR Rate Loans having an Interest Period of twelve months in duration, such notice must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. four (4) Business Days prior to the requested date of such conversion or continuation, whereupon the Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice to the applicable Lenders of such request and determine whether the requested Interest Period is acceptable to all of them; provided, further, that the Notice of Borrowing with respect to the Loans to be borrowed on the Closing Date may be in such form and may be delivered on such shorter notice as may be agreed by the Administrative Agent.  If the Borrower fails to give a timely Notice of Conversion/Continuation prior to the end of the Interest Period for any LIBOR Rate Loan, then the applicable LIBOR Rate Loan shall be continued as a LIBOR Rate Loan and will be deemed to have the same Interest Period as was then in effect prior to the expiration of the previous Interest Period during which the Borrower failed to give a timely Notice of Conversion/Continuation.  Any such automatic continuation of a LIBOR Rate Loan shall be effective as of the last day of the Interest Period then in effect with respect to the applicable LIBOR Rate Loan.  If the Borrower requests a conversion to, or continuation of, LIBOR Rate Loans, but fails to specify an Interest Period, it will be deemed to have specified an Interest Period of one month.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Swingline Loan may not be converted to a LIBOR Rate Loan.  The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the affected Lenders of such Notice of Conversion/Continuation.
 
SECTION 5.3                                        Fees.
 
(a)                                 Commitment Fee.  Commencing on the Closing Date, subject to Section 5.15(a)(iii)(A), the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Revolving Credit Lenders, a non-refundable commitment fee (the Commitment Fee), at a rate per annum equal to the applicable amount for Commitment Fees set forth in the definition of Applicable Margin, on the average daily unused portion of the Revolving Credit Commitment of the Revolving Credit Lenders (other than the
 
57





 
Defaulting Lenders, if any); provided that the amount of outstanding Swingline Loans shall not be considered usage of the Revolving Credit Commitment for the purpose of calculating the Commitment Fee.  The Commitment Fee shall be fully earned and due and payable quarterly in arrears (calculated on a 360-day basis) on the last Business Day of each calendar quarter during the term of this Agreement commencing with the last Business Day of the first calendar quarter ending after the Closing Date and ending on the date upon which all Obligations (other than contingent indemnification obligations not then due) arising under the Revolving Credit Facility shall have been indefeasibly and irrevocably paid and satisfied in full, all Letters of Credit have been terminated or expired (or been Cash Collateralized) and the Revolving Credit Commitment has been terminated.  The Commitment Fee shall be distributed by the Administrative Agent to the Revolving Credit Lenders (other than any Defaulting Lender) pro rata in accordance with such Revolving Credit Lenders respective Revolving Credit Commitment Percentages.
 
(b)                                 Other Fees.  The Borrower shall pay to the Arranger and the Administrative Agent for their own respective accounts fees in the amounts and at the times specified in their Fee Letter.  The Borrower shall pay to the Lenders such fees as shall have been separately agreed upon in writing in the amounts and at the times so specified.
 
SECTION 5.4                                        Manner of Payment.  Each payment by the Borrower on account of the principal of or interest on the Loans or of any fee, commission or other amounts (including the Reimbursement Obligation) payable to the Lenders under this Agreement shall be made not later than 1:00 p.m. on the date specified for payment under this Agreement to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agents Office for the account of the Lenders entitled to such payment in Dollars, in immediately available funds and shall be made without any set off, counterclaim or deduction whatsoever.  Any payment received after such time but before 2:00 p.m. on such day shall be deemed a payment on such date for the purposes of Section 10.1, but for all other purposes shall be deemed to have been made on the next succeeding Business Day.  Any payment received: (i) after 2:00 p.m., in the case of payments in Dollars; or (ii) after the Applicable Time specified by Administrative Agent in the case of payments in an Alternative Currency, shall in each case be deemed to have been made on the next succeeding Business Day for all purposes.  Upon receipt by the Administrative Agent of each such payment, the Administrative Agent shall distribute to each such Lender at its address for notices set forth herein its Commitment Percentage in respect of the relevant Credit Facility (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment and shall wire advice of the amount of such credit to each Lender.  Each payment to the Administrative Agent on account of the principal of or interest on the Swingline Loans or of any fee, commission or other amounts payable to the Swingline Lender shall be made in like manner, but for the account of the Swingline Lender.  Each payment to the Administrative Agent of any Issuing Lenders fees or L/C Participants commissions shall be made in like manner, but for the account of such Issuing Lender or the L/C Participants, as the case may be.  Each payment to the Administrative Agent of Administrative Agents fees or expenses shall be made for the account of the Administrative Agent and any amount payable to any Lender under Sections 5.9, 5.10, 5.11 or 12.3 shall be paid to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Lender.  Subject to the definition of Interest Period, if any payment under this Agreement shall be specified to be made upon a day which is not a Business Day, it shall be made on the next succeeding day which is a Business Day and such extension of time shall in such case be included in computing any interest if payable along with such payment.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if there exists a Defaulting Lender each payment by the Borrower to such Defaulting Lender hereunder shall be applied in accordance with Section 5.15(a)(ii).  If, for any reason, the Borrower is prohibited by any law from making any required payment hereunder in an Alternative Currency, the Borrower shall make such payment in Dollars in the Dollar Equivalent of the Alternative Currency payment amount.
 
58





 
SECTION 5.5                                        Evidence of Indebtedness.
 
(a)                                 Extensions of Credit.  The Extensions of Credit made by each Lender and each Issuing Lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender or such Issuing Lender and by the Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of business.  The accounts or records maintained by the Administrative Agent and each Lender or the applicable Issuing Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of the Extensions of Credit made by the Lenders or such Issuing Lender to the Borrower and its Subsidiaries and the interest and payments thereon.  Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations.  In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender or any Issuing Lender and the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error.  Upon the request of any Lender made through the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative Agent) a Revolving Credit Note, Term Loan Note and/or Swingline Note, as applicable, which shall evidence such Lenders Revolving Credit Loans, Term Loans and/or Swingline Loans, as applicable, in addition to such accounts or records.  Each Lender may attach schedules to its Notes and endorse thereon the date, amount and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto.
 
(b)                                 Participations.  In addition to the accounts and records referred to in subsection (a), each Revolving Credit Lender and the Administrative Agent shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice accounts or records evidencing the purchases and sales by such Revolving Credit Lender of participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans.  In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by the Administrative Agent and the accounts and records of any Revolving Credit Lender in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error.
 
SECTION 5.6                                        Sharing of Payments by Lenders.  If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans or other obligations hereunder resulting in such Lenders receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and accrued interest thereon or other such obligations (other than pursuant to Section 5.9, Section 5.10, Section 5.11 or Section 12.3) greater than its pro rata share thereof as provided herein, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall: (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact; and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and such other obligations of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and other amounts owing them; provided that:
 
(i)                                     if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and
 
(ii)                                  the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to: (A) any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender or a Disqualified Institution); (B) the application of Cash Collateral provided for in Section 5.14; or (C) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in Swingline Loans and Letters of Credit to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply).
 
59





 
Each Credit Party consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under Applicable Law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against each Credit Party rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of each Credit Party in the amount of such participation.
 
SECTION 5.7                                        Administrative Agents Clawback.
 
(a)                                 Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent.  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender: (i) in the case of Base Rate Loans, not later than 12:00 noon on the date of any proposed borrowing; and (ii) otherwise, prior to the proposed date of any borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lenders share of such borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with Sections 2.3(b) and 4.2 and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount.  In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at: (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the Overnight Rate, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing; and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans.  If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period.  If such Lender pays its share of the applicable borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lenders Loan included in such borrowing.  Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.
 
(b)                                 Payments by the Borrower; Presumptions by Administrative Agent.  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders, the Issuing Lender or the Swingline Lender hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders, the Issuing Lender or the Swingline Lender, as the case may be, the amount due.  In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders, the Issuing Lender or the Swingline Lender, as the case maybe, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender, Issuing Lender or the Swingline Lender, in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Overnight Rate.
 
(c)                                  Nature of Obligations of Lenders Regarding Extensions of Credit.  The obligations of the Lenders under this Agreement to make the Loans and issue or participate in Letters of Credit or pay any other amounts hereunder are several and are not joint or joint and several.  The failure of any Lender to make available its Commitment Percentage of any Loan requested by the Borrower or of any other amount hereunder shall not relieve it or any other Lender of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Commitment Percentage of such Loan available on the borrowing date or of such other amount hereunder on the applicable payment date, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make its Commitment Percentage of such Loan available on the borrowing date or of such other amount available on the applicable payment date.

SECTION 5.8                                        Changed Circumstances.
 
(a)                                 Circumstances Affecting LIBOR Rate Availability.  In connection with any request for a LIBOR Rate Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof, if for any reason: (i) the Administrative Agent shall determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in the London interbank Eurodollar market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Loan; (ii) the Administrative Agent shall determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that reasonable and adequate means do not exist for ascertaining the LIBOR Rate for such Interest Period with respect to a proposed LIBOR Rate Loan; or (iii) the Required Lenders shall determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that the LIBOR Rate does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining such Loans during such Interest Period, then the Administrative Agent shall promptly give notice thereof to the Borrower.  Thereafter, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower that such circumstances no longer exist, the obligation of the Lenders to make LIBOR Rate Loans and the right of the Borrower to convert any Loan to or continue any Loan as a LIBOR Rate Loan shall be suspended, and the Borrower shall either: (A) repay in full (or cause to be repaid in full) the then outstanding principal amount of each such LIBOR Rate Loan together with accrued interest thereon (subject to Section 5.1(d)), on the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable to such LIBOR Rate Loan; or (B) convert the then outstanding principal amount of each such LIBOR Rate Loan to a Base Rate Loan as of the last day of such Interest Period.
 
(b)                                 Laws Affecting LIBOR Rate Availability.  If, after the date hereof, the introduction of, or any change in, any Applicable Law or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any of the Lenders (or any of their respective Lending Offices) with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency, shall make it unlawful or impossible for any of the Lenders (or any of their respective Lending Offices) to honor its obligations hereunder to make or maintain any LIBOR Rate Loan, such Lender shall promptly give notice thereof to the Administrative Agent and the Administrative Agent shall promptly give notice to the Borrower and the other Lenders.  Thereafter, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower that such circumstances no longer exist: (i) the obligations of the Lenders to make LIBOR Rate Loans, and the right of the Borrower to convert any Loan to a LIBOR Rate Loan or continue any Loan as a LIBOR Rate Loan shall be suspended and thereafter the Borrower may select only Base Rate Loans; and (ii) if any of the Lenders may not lawfully continue to maintain a LIBOR Rate Loan to the end of the then current Interest Period applicable thereto, the applicable Loan shall immediately be converted to a Base Rate Loan for the remainder of such Interest Period.
 
SECTION 5.9                                        Indemnity.  The Borrower hereby indemnifies each of the Lenders against any loss or expense (including any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain a LIBOR Rate Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained) which may arise or be attributable to each Lenders obtaining, liquidating or employing deposits or other funds acquired to effect, fund or maintain any Loan: (a) as a consequence of any failure by the Borrower to make any payment when due of any amount due hereunder in connection with a LIBOR Rate Loan; (b) due to any failure of the Borrower to borrow, continue or convert on a date specified therefor in a Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation; or (c) due to any payment, prepayment or conversion of any LIBOR Rate Loan on a date other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor.  The amount of such loss or expense shall be determined, in the applicable Lenders sole discretion, based upon the assumption that such Lender funded its Commitment Percentage of the LIBOR Rate Loans in the London interbank market and using any reasonable attribution or averaging methods which such Lender deems appropriate and practical.  A certificate of such Lender
 
61





 
setting forth the basis for determining such amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender shall be forwarded to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent and shall be conclusively presumed to be correct save for manifest error.
 
SECTION 5.10                                 Increased Costs.
 
(a)                                 Increased Costs Generally.  If any Change in Law shall:
 
(i)                                     impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve (whether for capital adequacy or liquidity or otherwise), special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or advances, loans or other credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement reflected in the LIBOR Rate) or any Issuing Lender;
 
(ii)                                  subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than: (A) Indemnified Taxes; (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes; and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; or
 
(iii)                               impose on any Lender or any Issuing Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense (other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or LIBOR Rate Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;
 
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender, the Issuing Lender or such other Recipient of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan), or to increase the cost to such Lender, such Issuing Lender or such other Recipient of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of Credit), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender, such Issuing Lender or such other Recipient hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon written request of such Lender, such Issuing Lender or other Recipient, the Borrower shall promptly pay to any such Lender, such Issuing Lender or other Recipient, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender, such Issuing Lender or other Recipient, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
 
(b)                                 Capital Requirements.  If any Lender or any Issuing Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or such Issuing Lender or any lending office of such Lender or such Lenders or such Issuing Lenders holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lenders or such Issuing Lenders capital or on the capital of such Lenders or such Issuing Lenders holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Revolving Credit Commitment of such Lender or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit or Swingline Loans held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or such Issuing Lender or such Lenders or such Issuing Lenders holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lenders or such Issuing Lenders policies and the policies of such Lenders or such Issuing Lenders holding company with respect to capital adequacy and liquidity), then from time to time upon written request of such Lender or such Issuing Lender the Borrower shall promptly pay to such Lender or such Issuing Lender, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuing Lender or such Lenders or such Issuing Lenders holding company for any such reduction suffered.
 
62





 
(c)                                  Certificates for Reimbursement.  A certificate of a Lender, or an Issuing Lender or such other Recipient setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or such Issuing Lender, such other Recipient or any of their respective holding companies, as the case may be, as specified in clause (a) or (b) of this Section and delivered to the Borrower, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  The Borrower shall pay such Lender or such Issuing Lender or such other Recipient, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within ten (10) days after receipt thereof.
 
(d)                                 Delay in Requests.  Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or any Issuing Lender or such other Recipient to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lenders or such Issuing Lenders or such other Recipients right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate any Lender or an Issuing Lender or any other Recipient pursuant to this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than six (6) months prior to the date that such Lender or such Issuing Lender or such other Recipient, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions, and of such Lenders or such Issuing Lenders or such other Recipients intention to claim compensation therefor (except that if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the six-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).
 
SECTION 5.11                                 Taxes.
 
(a)                                 Defined Terms.  For purposes of this Section 5.11, the term Lender includes any Issuing Lender and the term Applicable Law includes FATCA.
 
(b)                                 Payments Free of Taxes.  Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Credit Party under any Loan Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by Applicable Law.  If any Applicable Law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable Withholding Agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a Withholding Agent, then the applicable Withholding Agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with Applicable Law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the applicable Credit Party shall be increased as necessary so that, after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section), the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made.
 
(c)                                  Payment of Other Taxes by the Credit Parties.  The Credit Parties shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with Applicable Law, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes.
 
(d)                                 Indemnification by the Credit Parties.  The Credit Parties shall jointly and severally indemnify each Recipient, within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Recipient (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Recipient, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
 
63





 
(e)                                  Indemnification by the Lenders.  Each Lender and each Issuing Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for: (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Credit Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Credit Parties to do so); (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lenders failure to comply with the provisions of Section 12.9(d) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register; and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this clause (e).  Any amounts set off and applied by the Administrative Agent pursuant to the preceding sentence in respect of amounts paid by the Borrower shall be treated as having been paid by the Borrower for purposes of the Loan Documents.  The agreements in this paragraph (e) shall survive the resignation and/or replacement of the Administrative Agent.
 
(f)                                   Evidence of Payments.  As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by any Credit Party to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section 5.11, such Credit Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
 
(g)                                  Status of Lenders.
 
(i)                                     Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding.  In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by Applicable Law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 5.11(g)(ii)(B), (ii)(C) and (ii)(E) below) shall not be required if in the Lenders reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.
 
(ii)                                  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that the Borrower is a U.S. Person:
 
(A)                               The Administrative Agent, and any successor Administrative Agent that is a U.S. Person, shall deliver an executed IRS Form W-9 to the Borrower on or prior to the date the Administrative Agent becomes a party hereto and any successor Administrative Agent that is not a U.S. Person shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to
 
64





 
do so, provide to the Borrower any and all forms described in Section 5.11(g)(ii)(C) and Section 5.11(g)(ii)(D) below;
 
(B)                               Any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed copies of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from United States federal backup withholding tax;
 
(C)                               any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:
 
(1)                                 in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party: (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, United States federal withholding Tax pursuant to the interest article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, United States federal withholding Tax pursuant to the business profits or other income article of such tax treaty;
 
(2)                                 executed copies of IRS Form W-8ECI;
 
(3)                                 in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code: (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a bank within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a 10 percent shareholder of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a controlled foreign corporation described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate); and (y) executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN-E; or
 
(4)                                 to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner of payments made to it, executed copies of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN-E, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-2 or Exhibit H-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner;
 
(D)                               any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender
 
65





 
becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed copies of any other form prescribed by Applicable Law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in United States federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by Applicable Law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and
 
(E)                                if a payment made to a Recipient under any Loan Document would be subject to United States federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Recipient were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Recipient shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by Applicable Law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by Applicable Law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Recipient has complied with such Lenders obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.  Solely for purposes of this clause (E), FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
 
Each Recipient agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.
 
(h)                                 Treatment of Certain Refunds.  If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it is entitled and for which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 5.11 (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section 5.11), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund).  Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this clause (h) (plus any interest imposed by the relevant Go

to an indemnifying party pursuant to this clause (h) if: (i) payment of the additional amounts pursuant to this Section 5.11 are not due to the indemnified partys failure to file a timely and accurate form or certification or timely update such form or certification as required pursuant to Section 5.11(g); and (ii) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid.  This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.
 
66

 




 
(i)                                     Tax Reporting Cooperation.  The Administrative Agent shall, to the extent such information is in its possession, provide the information reasonably requested by the Borrower for the purpose of complying with the requirements of Treasury Regulations Section 1.1273-2(f)(9) to the extent such regulation is applicable to any Loan made pursuant to this Agreement.
 
(j)                                    Survival.  Each partys obligations under this Section 5.11 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document.
 
SECTION 5.12                                 Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.
 
(a)                                 Designation of a Different Lending Office.  If any Lender requests compensation under Section 5.10, or requires the Borrower to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 5.11, then such Lender shall, at the request of the Borrower, use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment: (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 5.10 or Section 5.11, as the case may be, in the future; and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
 
(b)                                 Replacement of Lenders.  If any Lender requests compensation under Section 5.10, or if the Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 5.11, and, in each case, such Lender has declined or is unable to designate a different lending office in accordance with Section 5.12(a), or if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender or a Non-Consenting Lender, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 12.9), all of its interests, rights (other than its existing rights to payments pursuant to Section 5.10 or Section 5.11) and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents (or in the case of a Non-Consenting Lender, all of such interests, rights and obligations with respect to the Series or Class of Loans or Commitments that is the subject of the related consent, waiver, amendment, modification or termination) to an Eligible Assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that:
 
(i)                                     the Borrower shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the assignment fee (if any) specified in Section 12.9;
 
(ii)                                  such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and funded participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under Section 5.9) from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts);
 
(iii)                               in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 5.10 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 5.11, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter;
 
67





 
(iv)                              such assignment does not conflict with Applicable Law; and
 
(v)                                 in the case of any assignment resulting from a Lender becoming a Non-Consenting Lender, the applicable assignee shall have consented to the applicable amendment, waiver or consent.
 
A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.
 
SECTION 5.13                                 [Reserved].
 
SECTION 5.14                                 Cash Collateral.  At any time that there shall exist a Defaulting Lender, within one (1) Business Day following the written request of the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) or the Swingline Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall Cash Collateralize the Fronting Exposure of such Issuing Lender and/or the Swingline Lender, as applicable, with respect to such Defaulting Lender (determined after giving effect to Section 5.15(a)(iv) and any Cash Collateral provided by such Defaulting Lender) in an amount not less than the Minimum Collateral Amount.  Additionally, if the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower at any time that the L/C Obligations at such time exceeds 102% of the L/C Sublimit then in effect, then, within two (2) Business Days after receipt of such notice, the Borrower shall provide Cash Collateral for the L/C Obligations in an amount not less than the amount by which the L/C Obligations exceeds the L/C Sublimit.
 
(a)                                 Grant of Security Interest.  The Borrower, and to the extent provided by any Defaulting Lender, such Defaulting Lender, hereby grants to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of each Issuing Lender and the Swingline Lender, and agrees to maintain, a first priority security interest in all such Cash Collateral as security for the Defaulting Lenders obligation to fund participations in respect of L/C Obligations and Swingline Loans, to be applied pursuant to Section 5.15(b).  If at any time the Administrative Agent determines that Cash Collateral is subject to any right or claim of any Person other than the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Lender and the Swingline Lender as herein provided, or that the total amount of such Cash Collateral is less than the Minimum Collateral Amount, the Borrower will, promptly upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay or provide to the Administrative Agent additional Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to eliminate such deficiency (after giving effect to any Cash Collateral provided by the Defaulting Lender).
 
(b)                                 Application.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Cash Collateral provided under this Section 5.14 or Section 5.15 in respect of Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans shall be applied to the satisfaction of the Defaulting Lenders obligation to fund participations in respect of L/C Obligations and Swingline Loans (including, as to Cash Collateral provided by a Defaulting Lender, any interest accrued on such obligation) for which the Cash Collateral was so provided, prior to any other application of such property as may otherwise be provided for herein.
 
(c)                                  Termination of Requirement.  Cash Collateral (or the appropriate portion thereof) provided to reduce the Fronting Exposure of any Issuing Lender and/or the Swingline Lender, as applicable, shall no longer be required to be held as Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section 5.14 following (i) the elimination of the applicable Fronting Exposure (including by the termination of Defaulting Lender status of the applicable Lender), or (ii) the determination by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lenders and the Swingline Lender that there exists excess Cash Collateral; provided that, subject to Section 5.15, the Person providing Cash Collateral, the Issuing Lenders and the Swingline Lender may agree that Cash Collateral shall be held to support future anticipated Fronting Exposure or
 
68

SECTION 5.15                                 Defaulting Lenders.
 
(a)                                 Defaulting Lender Adjustments.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as such Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law:
 
(i)                                     Waivers and Amendments.  Such Defaulting Lenders right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in the definition of Required Lenders and Section 12.2.

effect to Section 5.15(a)(iv). Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section 5.15(a)(ii) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.
 
(iii)                               Certain Fees.
 
(A)                               No Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive any Commitment Fee for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and the Borrower shall not be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender).
 
(B)                               Each Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive letter of credit commissions pursuant to Section 3.3 for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender only to the extent allocable to its Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage of the stated amount of Letters of Credit for which it has provided Cash Collateral pursuant to Section 5.14.
 
(C)                               With respect to any Commitment Fee or letter of credit commission not required to be paid to any Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (A) or (B) above, the Borrower shall: (1) pay to each Non-Defaulting Lender that portion of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender with respect to such Defaulting Lenders participation in L/C Obligations or Swingline Loans that has been reallocated to such Non-Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (iv) below; (2) pay to each applicable Issuing Lender and Swingline Lender, as applicable, the amount of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender to the extent allocable to such Issuing Lenders or Swingline Lenders Fronting Exposure to such Defaulting Lender; and (3) not be required to pay the remaining amount of any such fee.
 
(iv)                              Reallocation of Participations to Reduce Fronting Exposure.  All or any part of such Defaulting Lenders participation in L/C Obligations and Swingline Loans shall be reallocated among the Non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Revolving Credit Commitment Percentages (calculated without regard to such Defaulting Lenders Revolving Credit Commitment) but only to the extent that such reallocation does not cause the aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure of any Non-Defaulting Lender to exceed such Non-Defaulting Lenders Revolving Credit Commitment.  No reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a Non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such Non-Defaulting Lenders increased exposure following such reallocation.
 
(v)                                 Cash Collateral, Repayment of Swingline Loans.  If the reallocation described in clause (iv) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrower shall, without prejudice to any right or remedy available to it hereunder or under law: (x) first, repay Swingline Loans in an amount equal to the Swingline Lenders Fronting Exposure; and (y) second, Cash Collateralize the Issuing Lenders Fronting Exposure in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 5.14.
 
(b)                                 Defaulting Lender Cure.  If the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lenders and the Swingline Lender agree in writing that a Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect
 
70





 
to any Cash Collateral), such Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans to be held pro rata by the Lenders in accordance with the Commitments under the applicable Credit Facility (without giving effect to Section 5.15(a)(iv)), whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided further that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lenders having been a Defaulting Lender.
 
SECTION 5.16                                 Amend and Extend Transactions.
 
(a)                                 The Borrower may, by written notice to the Administrative Agent from time to time, request an extension (each, an Extension) of the maturity date of any Series of Loans and Commitments to the extended maturity date specified in such notice. Such notice shall: (i) set forth the amount of the applicable Series of Revolving Credit Commitments and/or Term Loans that will be subject to the Extension (which shall be in minimum increments of $10,000,000 and a minimum amount of $50,000,000); (ii) set forth the date on which such Extension is requested to become effective (which shall be not less than ten (10) Business Days nor more than sixty (60) days after the date of such Extension notice (or such longer or shorter periods as the Administrative Agent shall agree in its sole discretion)); (iii) identify the relevant Series of Revolving Credit Commitments and/or Term Loans to which such Extension relates; and (iv) specify any other amendments or modifications to this Agreement to be effected in connection with such Extension, which amendments or modifications shall apply only to the applicable Extended Revolving Credit Commitments or Extended Term Loans and shall comply with Section 5.16(c).

If the aggregate principal amount of Revolving Credit Commitments or Term Loans in respect of which Lenders shall have accepted the relevant Extension Offer shall exceed the maximum aggregate principal amount of Revolving Credit Commitments or Term Loans, as applicable, subject to the Extension Offer as set forth in the Extension notice, then the Revolving Credit Commitments or Term Loans, as applicable, of Lenders of the applicable Series shall be extended ratably up to such maximum amount based on the respective principal amounts with respect to which such Lenders have accepted such Extension Offer.  Each group of Term Loans or Revolving Credit Commitments, as applicable, in each case as so extended pursuant to this Section 5.16, as well as the Term Loans and the Revolving Credit Commitments made on the Closing Date (in each case not so extended), shall be deemed a separate Series; any Extended Term Loans shall constitute a separate Series of Term Loans from the Series of Term Loans from which they were converted; and any Extended Revolving Credit Commitments shall constitute a separate Series of Revolving Credit Commitments from the Series of Revolving Credit Commitments from which they were converted.
 
(b)                                 The following shall be conditions precedent to the effectiveness of any Extension: (i) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing immediately prior to and immediately after giving effect to such Extension; (ii) the representations and warranties set forth in Article VII and in each other Loan Document shall be deemed to be made and shall be true and correct in all material respects (except to the extent any such representation or warranty is qualified by materiality or reference to Material Adverse Effect, in which case, such representation or warranty shall be true and correct in all respects) on and as of the effective date of such Extension; (iii) the Issuing Lender and the Swingline Lender shall have consented to any Extension of the Revolving Credit Commitments, to the extent that such Extension provides for the issuance or extension of Letters of Credit or making of Swingline Loans
 
71





 
at any time during the extended period; and (iv) the terms of such Extended Revolving Credit Commitments and Extended Term Loans shall comply with paragraph (c) of this Section.
 
(c)                                  The terms of each Extension shall be determined by the Borrower and the applicable extending Lenders and set forth in an Extension Amendment; provided that (i) the final maturity date of any Series of Extended Revolving Credit Commitments or Series of Extended Term Loans shall be no earlier than the Revolving Credit Maturity Date or the Term Loan Maturity Date for the applicable Series, respectively; (ii)(A) there shall be no scheduled amortization of the loans or reductions of commitments under any Extended Revolving Credit Commitments and (B) the average life to maturity of any Series of Extended Term Loans shall be no shorter than the remaining average life to maturity of each existing Series of Term Loans; (iii) the Extended Revolving Credit Loans and the Extended Term Loans will rank pari passu in right of payment and with respect to security with the existing Revolving Credit Loans and the existing Term Loans and the borrower and guarantors of the Extended Revolving Credit Commitments or Extended Term Loans, as applicable, shall be the same as the Borrower and Guarantors with respect to the existing Revolving Credit Loans or Term Loans, as applicable; (iv) the interest rate margin, rate floors, fees, original issue discount and premium applicable to any Series of Extended Revolving Credit Commitment (and the Extended Revolving Credit Loans thereunder) and any Series of Extended Term Loans shall be determined by the Borrower and the applicable extending Lenders; (v)(A) any Series of Extended Term Loans may participate on a pro rata or less than pro rata (but not greater than pro rata) basis in voluntary or mandatory prepayments with the other Series of Term Loans and (B) borrowing and prepayment of Extended Revolving Credit Loans, or reductions of Extended Revolving Credit Commitments, and participation in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans, shall be on a pro rata basis with the other Revolving Credit Loans or Revolving Credit Commitments (except that the Borrower shall be permitted to permanently repay and terminate commitments of any such Series on a better than a pro rata basis as compared to any other Series with a later maturity date than such Series); and (vi) the terms of the Extended Revolving Credit Commitments or Extended Term Loans, as applicable, shall be substantially identical to the terms set forth herein (except as set forth in clauses (i) through (v) above and for terms applicable only after the Revolving Credit Maturity Date (in the case of Extended Revolving Credit Commitments) or the Latest Maturity Date (in the case of Extended Term Loans)).
 
(d)                                 In connection with any Extension, the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and each applicable extending Lender shall execute and deliver or cause to be delivered to the Administrative Agent an Extension Amendment and such other documentation (including, without limitation, supplements or amendments to the Security Documents, customary legal opinions, officers certificates and resolutions duly adopted by the board of directors (or equivalent governing body) of each Credit Party authorizing such Extension) as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably specify to evidence the Extension. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender as to the effectiveness of each Extension. Any Extension Amendment may, without the consent of any other Lender, effect such amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to implement the terms of any such Extension, including any amendments necessary to establish Extended Revolving Credit Commitments or Extended Term Loans as a new Series of Revolving Credit Commitments or Term Loans, as applicable, and such other amendments as may be necessary or appropriate in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower in connection with the establishment of such new Series (including to preserve the pro rata treatment of the extended and non-extended Series and to provide for the reallocation of Revolving Credit Exposure upon the expiration or termination of the commitments under any Class or tranche), in each case on terms consistent with this section.

Third, to payment of that portion of the Secured Obligations constituting accrued and unpaid interest on the Loans and Reimbursement Obligations, ratably among the Lenders in proportion to the respective amounts described in this clause Third payable to them;

Fifth, to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Lenders, to Cash Collateralize any L/C Obligations then outstanding; and
 
Last, the balance, if any, after the Discharge of the Secured Obligations, to the Borrower or as otherwise required by Applicable Law.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Secured Obligations arising under Secured Cash Management Agreements and Secured Hedge Agreements shall be excluded from the application described above if the Administrative Agent has not received written notice thereof, together with such supporting documentation as the Administrative Agent may request, from the Borrower or the applicable Cash Management Bank or Hedge Bank, as the case may be.  Each Cash Management Bank or Hedge Bank not a party to this Agreement that has given the notice contemplated by the preceding sentence shall, by such notice, be deemed to have acknowledged and accepted the appointment of the Administrative Agent pursuant to the terms of Article XI for itself and its Affiliates as if a Lender party hereto.
 
SECTION 10.5           Administrative Agent May File Proofs of Claim.  In case of the pendency of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or any other judicial proceeding relative to any Credit Party, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan or L/C Obligation shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the 
 
116





 
Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered (but not obligated) by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise:
 
(a)           to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans, L/C Obligations and all other Secured Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders, the Issuing Lenders and the Administrative Agent (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders, the Issuing Lenders and the Administrative Agent and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders, the Issuing Lenders and the Administrative Agent under Section 3.3, Section 5.3 and Section 12.3) allowed in such judicial proceeding; and
 
(b)           to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;
 
and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender and each Issuing Lender to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders and the Issuing Lenders, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Administrative Agent under Section 3.3, Section 5.3 and Section 12.3.
 
(c)           Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to, or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender or any Issuing Lender, any plan of reorganization, arrangement or adjustment affecting the Secured Obligations or the rights of any Lender or any Issuing Lender or to authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender or any Issuing Lender or in any such proceeding.
 
SECTION 10.6           Credit Bidding.
 
(a)           The Administrative Agent, on behalf of itself and the Secured Parties and at the direction of the Required Lenders, shall have the right to credit bid and purchase for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Secured Parties all or any portion of Collateral at any sale thereof conducted by the Administrative Agent under the provisions of the UCC, including pursuant to Sections 9-610 or 9-620 of the UCC, at any sale thereof conducted under the provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code, including Section 363 thereof, or a sale under a plan of reorganization, or at any other sale or foreclosure conducted by the Administrative Agent (whether by judicial action or otherwise) in accordance with Applicable Law.  Such credit bid or purchase may be completed through one or more acquisition vehicles formed by the Administrative Agent to make such credit bid or purchase and, in connection therewith, the Administrative Agent is authorized, on behalf of itself and the other Secured Parties, to adopt documents providing for the governance of the acquisition vehicle or vehicles, and assign the applicable Secured Obligations to any such acquisition vehicle in exchange for Equity Interests and/or debt issued by the applicable acquisition vehicle (which shall be deemed to be held for the ratable account of the applicable Secured Parties on the basis of the Secured Obligations so assigned by each Secured Party).
 
(b)           Each Lender hereby agrees, on behalf of itself and each of its Affiliates that is a Secured Party, that, except as otherwise provided in any Loan Document or with the written consent of the Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders, it will not take any enforcement action, accelerate 
 
117





 
obligations under any of the Loan Documents, or exercise any right that it might otherwise have under Applicable Law to credit bid at foreclosure sales, UCC sales or other similar dispositions of Collateral.
 
ARTICLE XI
 
THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT
 
SECTION 11.1           Appointment and Authority.
 
(a)           Each of the Lenders and each Issuing Lender hereby irrevocably appoints Wells Fargo to act on its behalf as the Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.  The provisions of this Article are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Issuing Lenders, and neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary thereof shall have rights as a third-party beneficiary of any of such provisions.  It is understood and agreed that the use of the term agent herein or in any other Loan Documents (or any other similar term) with reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any Applicable Law. Instead such term is used as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting parties.
 
(b)           The Administrative Agent shall also act as the collateral agent under the Loan Documents, and each of the Lenders (including in its capacity as a potential Hedge Bank or Cash Management Bank) and the Issuing Lenders hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent to act as the agent of such Lender and such Issuing Lender for purposes of acquiring, holding and enforcing any and all Liens on Collateral granted by any of the Credit Parties to secure any of the Secured Obligations, together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto (including, without limitation, to enter into additional Loan Documents or supplements to existing Loan Documents on behalf of the Secured Parties).  In this connection, the Administrative Agent, as collateral agent and any co-agents, sub-agents and attorneys-in-fact appointed by the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Article XI for purposes of holding or enforcing any Lien on the Collateral (or any portion thereof) granted under the Security Documents, or for exercising any rights and remedies thereunder at the direction of the Administrative Agent, shall be entitled to the benefits of all provisions of Articles XI and XII (including Section 12.3, as though such co-agents, sub-agents and attorneys-in-fact were the collateral agent under the Loan Documents) as if set forth in full herein with respect thereto.
 
SECTION 11.2           Rights as a Lender.  The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent and the term Lender or Lenders shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity.  Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, own securities of, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.
 
118





 
SECTION 11.3           Exculpatory Provisions.
 
(a)           The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, and its duties hereunder and thereunder shall be administrative in nature.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent:
 
(i)            shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing;
 
(ii)           shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents), provided that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or Applicable Law, including for the avoidance of doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any Debtor Relief Law or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any Debtor Relief Law; and
 
(iii)          shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.
 
(b)           The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Section 12.2 and Section 10.2) or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final nonappealable judgment.  The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default or Event of Default unless and until notice describing such Default or Event of Default is given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower, a Lender or an Issuing Lender.
 
(c)           The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into: (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document; (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith (including, without limitation, any report provided to it by an Issuing Lender pursuant to Section 3.9); (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article VI or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent; or (vi) the utilization of any Issuing Lenders L/C Commitment (it being understood and agreed that each Issuing Lender shall monitor compliance with its own L/C Commitment without any further action by the Administrative Agent).
 
(d)           The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible or have any liability for, or have any duty to ascertain, inquire into, monitor, or enforce compliance with the provisions hereof relating to Disqualified Institutions.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent shall 
 
119





 
not: (i) be obligated to ascertain, monitor, or inquire as to whether any Lender or Participant or prospective Lender or Participant is a Disqualified Institution; or (y) have any liability with respect to or arising out of any assignment or participation of Loans, or disclosure of confidential information, to any Disqualified Institution.
 
SECTION 11.4           Reliance by the Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person.  The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon.  In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, or the issuance, extension, renewal or increase of a Letter of Credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or an Issuing Lender, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender or such Issuing Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender or such Issuing Lender prior to the making of such Loan or the issuance of such Letter of Credit.  The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
 
SECTION 11.5           Delegation of Duties.  The Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties.  The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the Credit Facility as well as activities as Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any sub-agents except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and nonappealable judgment that the Administrative Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such sub-agents.
 
SECTION 11.6           Resignation of Administrative Agent.
 
(a)           The Administrative Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders, the Issuing Lenders and the Borrower.  Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the Borrower to appoint a successor, which shall be a bank with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States.  If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the Resignation Effective Date), then the retiring Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to), on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above; provided that in no event shall any such successor Administrative Agent be a Defaulting Lender or a Disqualified Institution.  Whether or not a successor has been appointed, such resignation shall become effective in accordance with such notice on the Resignation Effective Date.
 
(b)           If the Person serving as Administrative Agent is a Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (d) of the definition thereof, the Required Lenders may, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, by notice in writing to the Borrower and such Person, remove such Person as Administrative Agent and, in 
 
120





 
consultation with the Borrower, appoint a successor. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the Removal Effective Date), then such removal shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice on the Removal Effective Date.
 
(c)           With effect from the Resignation Effective Date or the Removal Effective Date (as applicable), (i) the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (except that in the case of any collateral security held by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders or the Issuing Lenders under any of the Loan Documents, the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall continue to hold such collateral security until such time as a successor Administrative Agent is appointed) and (ii) except for any indemnity payments owed to the retiring or removed Administrative Agent, all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender and each Issuing Lender directly, until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided for above.  Upon the acceptance of a successors appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring or removed Administrative Agent (other than any rights to indemnity payments owed to the retiring or removed Administrative Agent), and the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents.  The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor.  After the retiring or removed Administrative Agents resignation or removal hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article and Section 12.3 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring or removed Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring or removed Administrative Agent was acting as Administrative Agent.
 
(d)           Any resignation by, or removal of, Wells Fargo as Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section shall also constitute its resignation as an Issuing Lender and Swingline Lender.  Upon the acceptance of a successors appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder: (i) such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Issuing Lender, if in its sole discretion it elects to, and Swingline Lender; (ii) the retiring Issuing Lender and Swingline Lender shall be discharged from all of their respective duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents; and (iii) the successor Issuing Lender, if in its sole discretion it elects to, shall issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession or make other arrangement satisfactory to the retiring Issuing Lender to effectively assume the obligations of the retiring Issuing Lender with respect to such Letters of Credit.
 
SECTION 11.7           Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Lenders.  Each Lender and each Issuing Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement.  Each Lender and each Issuing Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.
 
SECTION 11.8           No Other Duties, etc.  Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none of the syndication agents, documentation agents, co-agents, arrangers or bookrunners listed on the cover 
 
121





 
page hereof shall have any powers, duties or responsibilities under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, except in its capacity, as applicable, as the Administrative Agent, a Lender or an Issuing Lender hereunder.
 
SECTION 11.9           Collateral and Guaranty Matters.
 
(a)           Each of the Lenders (including in its or any of its Affiliates capacities as a potential Hedge Bank or Cash Management Bank) irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent, at its option and in its discretion:
 
(i)            to release any Lien on any Collateral granted to or held by the Administrative Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Secured Parties, under any Loan Document: (A) upon the Discharge of the Secured Obligations; (B) that is sold or otherwise disposed of or to be sold or otherwise disposed of as part of or in connection with any sale or other disposition permitted under the Loan Documents; or (C) if approved, authorized or ratified in writing in accordance with Section 12.2;
 
(ii)           to subordinate any Lien on any Collateral granted to or held by the Administrative Agent under any Loan Document to the holder of any Lien permitted by Section 9.2(i); and
 
(iii)          to release any Subsidiary Guarantor from its obligations under any Loan Documents if such Person ceases to be a Subsidiary as a result of a transaction permitted under the Loan Documents.
 
Upon request by the Administrative Agent at any time, the Required Lenders will confirm in writing the Administrative Agents authority to release or subordinate its interest in particular types or items of property, or to release any Subsidiary Guarantor from its obligations under the Guaranty Agreement pursuant to this Section 11.9.  In each case as specified in this Section 11.9, the Administrative Agent will, at the Borrowers expense, execute and deliver to the applicable Credit Party such documents as such Credit Party may reasonably request to evidence the release of such item of Collateral from the assignment and security interest granted under the Security Documents or to subordinate its interest in such item, or to release such Subsidiary Guarantor from its obligations under the Guaranty Agreement, in each case in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents and this Section 11.9.  In the case of any such sale, transfer or disposal of any property constituting Collateral in a transaction constituting an Asset Disposition permitted pursuant to Section 9.5 or other disposition not constituting an Asset Disposition, but otherwise expressly permitted under this Agreement, the Liens created by any of the Security Documents on such property shall be automatically released without need for further action by any person.
 
(b)           The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have a duty to ascertain or inquire into any representation or warranty regarding the existence, value or collectability of the Collateral, the existence, priority or perfection of the Administrative Agents Lien thereon, or any certificate prepared by any Credit Party in connection therewith, nor shall the Administrative Agent be responsible or liable to the Lenders for any failure to monitor or maintain any portion of the Collateral.
 
SECTION 11.10         Secured Hedge Agreements and Secured Cash Management Agreements.  No Cash Management Bank or Hedge Bank that obtains the benefits of Section 10.4 or any Collateral by virtue of the provisions hereof or of any Security Document shall have any right to notice of any action or to consent to, direct or object to any action hereunder or under any other Loan Document or otherwise in respect of the Collateral (including the release or impairment of any Collateral) other than in its capacity 
 
122





 
as a Lender and, in such case, only to the extent expressly provided in the Loan Documents.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article XI to the contrary, the Administrative Agent shall not be required to verify the payment of, or that other satisfactory arrangements have been made with respect to, Secured Cash Management Agreements and Secured Hedge Agreements unless the Administrative Agent has received written notice of such Secured Cash Management Agreements and Secured Hedge Agreements, together with such supporting documentation as the Administrative Agent may request, from the applicable Cash Management Bank or Hedge Bank, as the case may be.

(e)           Platform.
 
(i)            Each Credit Party agrees that the Administrative Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, make the Borrower Materials available to the Issuing Lenders and the other Lenders by posting the Borrower Materials on the Platform.  The Borrower acknowledges and agrees that the DQ List shall be deemed suitable for posting and may be posted by the Administrative Agent on the Platform, including the portion of the Platform that is designated for public side Lenders.
 
(ii)           The Platform is provided as is and as available.  The Agent Parties (as defined below) do not warrant the accuracy or completeness of the Borrower Materials or the adequacy of the Platform, and expressly disclaim liability for errors or omissions in the Borrower Materials.  No warranty of any kind, express, implied or statutory, including, without limitation, any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement of third-party rights or freedom from viruses or other code defects, is made by any Agent Party in connection with the Borrower Materials or the Platform.  In no event shall the Administrative Agent or any of its Related Parties (collectively, the Agent Parties) have any liability to any Credit Party, any Lender or any other Person or entity for losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses of any kind (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) arising out of any Credit Partys or the Administrative Agents transmission of communications through the Internet (including, without limitation, the Platform), except to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Agent Party; provided that in no event shall any Agent Party have any liability to any Credit Party, any Lender, the Issuing Lender or any other Person for indirect, special, incidental, consequential or punitive damages, losses or expenses (as opposed to actual damages, losses or expenses).
 
(f)            Private Side Designation.  Each Public Lender agrees to cause at least one individual at or on behalf of such Public Lender to at all times have selected the Private Side Information or similar designation on the content declaration screen of the Platform in order to enable such Public Lender or its delegate, in accordance with such Public Lenders compliance procedures and Applicable Law, including United States Federal and state securities Applicable Laws, to make reference to Borrower Materials that are not made available through the Public Side Information portion of the Platform and that may contain material non-public information with respect to the Borrower or its securities for purposes of United States Federal or state securities Applicable Laws.
 
SECTION 12.2           Amendments, Waivers and Consents.  Except as set forth below or as specifically provided in any Loan Document, any term, covenant, agreement or condition of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents may be amended or waived by the Lenders, and any consent given by the Lenders, if, but only if, such amendment, waiver or consent is in writing signed by the Required Lenders and delivered to the Administrative Agent (or by the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders) and, in the case of an amendment, signed by the Borrower; provided that no amendment, waiver or consent shall:
 
(a)           without the prior written consent of the Required Revolving Credit Lenders, amend, modify or waive (i) Section 6.2 or any other provision of this Agreement if the effect of such amendment, modification or waiver is to require the Revolving Credit Lenders (pursuant to, in the case of any such amendment to a provision hereof other than Section 6.2, any substantially concurrent request by the Borrower for a borrowing of Revolving Credit Loans) to make Revolving Credit Loans when such Revolving Credit Lenders would not otherwise be required to do so, (ii) the amount of the Swingline Commitment or (iii) the amount of the L/C Sublimit;
 
(b)           increase the Commitment of any Lender (or reinstate any Commitment terminated pursuant to Section 10.2) or the amount of Loans of any Lender, in any case, without the written consent 
 
125





 
of such Lender (it being understood that a waiver of any condition precedent set forth in Section 6.2 or the waiver of any Default or Event of Default or mandatory prepayment shall not constitute an extension or increase of any Commitment of any Lender);
 
(c)           waive, extend or postpone any date fixed by this Agreement or any other Loan Document for any payment (it being understood that a waiver of a mandatory prepayment under Section 4.4(b) shall only require consent of the Required Lenders and a waiver of a Lenders ratable portion of any prepayment under Section 4.4(b) shall only require consent of such Lender) of principal, interest, fees or other amounts due to the Lenders (or any of them), or any scheduled or mandatory reduction of the Revolving Credit Commitment, hereunder or under any other Loan Document, in each case without the written consent of each Lender directly and adversely affected thereby;

(B)          the consent of the Administrative Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required for assignments in respect of: (x) the Revolving Credit Facility or any unfunded Term Loan Commitments if such assignment is to a Person that is not a Lender with a Revolving Credit Commitment or a Term Loan Commitment, as applicable, an Affiliate of such Lender, or an Approved Fund with respect to such Lender; or (y) any Term Loans to a Person who is not a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender, or an Approved Fund; and

(vii)         Certain Additional Payments.  In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments to the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with the consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Loans previously requested, but not funded by, the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to: (A) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lenders, the Swingline Lender and each other Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon); and (B) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro rata share of all Loans and participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans in accordance with its Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under Applicable Law without compliance with the provisions of this clause, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs.
 
Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to clause (c) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto), but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 5.8, 5.9, 5.10, 5.11 and 12.3 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment; provided that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no assignment by a Defaulting Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lenders having been a Defaulting Lender.  Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this clause (b) shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with clause (d) of this Section (other than a purported assignment to a natural Person or the Borrower or any of the Borrowers Subsidiaries or Affiliates, which shall be null and void.)
 
(c)           Register.  The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices in Palo Alto, California, a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of, and principal amounts of (and stated interest on) the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the Register).  The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement.  The Register shall be available for inspection by 
 
134





 
the Borrower and any Lender (but only to the extent of entries in the Register that are applicable to such Lender), at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
 
(d)           Participations.  Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural Person (or a holding company, investment vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated for the primary benefit of, a natural Person), or the Borrower or any of the Borrowers Subsidiaries or Affiliates) (each, a Participant) in all or a portion of such Lenders rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans owing to it); provided that: (i) such Lenders obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged; (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations; and (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender, the Swingline Lender and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement.  For the avoidance of doubt, each Lender shall be responsible for the indemnity under Section 12.3(c) with respect to any payments made by such Lender to its Participant(s).
 
Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in Section 12.2(b), (c), (d) or (e) that directly and adversely affects such Participant.  The Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 5.9, 5.10 and 5.11 (subject to the requirements and limitations therein, including the requirements under Section 5.11(g) (it being understood that the documentation required under Section 5.11(g) shall be delivered to the participating Lender)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to clause (b) of this Section; provided that such Participant: (A) agrees to be subject to the provisions of Section 5.12 as if it were an assignee under clause (b) of this Section; and (B) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 5.10 or 5.11, with respect to any participation, than its participating Lender would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation.  Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at the Borrowers request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrower to effectuate the provisions of Section 5.12(b) with respect to any Participant.  To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 12.4 as though it were a Lender; provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 5.6 as though it were a Lender.
 
Each participation sold by a Lender shall be issued and maintained at all times in registered form as that term is defined in Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations.  Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts of (and stated interest on) each Participants interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the Participant Register); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participants interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations.  The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.
 
135





 
(e)           Certain Pledges.  Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including without limitation any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.
 
(f)            Disqualified Institutions.
 
(i)            No assignment or participation shall be made to any Person that was a Disqualified Institution as of the date (the Trade Date) on which the assigning Lender entered into a binding agreement to sell and assign all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to such Person (unless (A) the Borrower has consented to such assignment in writing in its sole and absolute discretion, or (B) an Event of Default under Section 10.01(h) or (i) exists and is continuing on the applicable Trade Date, in which case such Person will not be considered a Disqualified Institution for the purpose of such assignment or participation).  For the avoidance of doubt, with respect to any assignee that becomes a Disqualified Institution after the applicable Trade Date (including as a result of the delivery of a notice pursuant to, and/or the expiration of the notice period referred to in, the definition of Disqualified Institution): (x) such assignee shall not retroactively be disqualified from becoming a Lender; and (y) the execution by the Borrower of an Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignee will not by itself result in such assignee no longer being considered a Disqualified Institution.  Any assignment in violation of this clause (i) shall not be void, but the other provisions of this clause (f) shall apply.
 
(ii)           If any assignment or participation is made to any Disqualified Institution without the Borrowers prior written consent in violation of clause (i) above, or if any Person becomes a Disqualified Institution after the applicable Trade Date, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to the applicable Disqualified Institution and the Administrative Agent: (A) terminate any Revolving Credit Commitment of such Disqualified Institution and repay all obligations of the Borrower owing to such Disqualified Institution in connection with such Revolving Credit Commitment; (B) in the case of outstanding Term Loans held by Disqualified Institutions, purchase or prepay such Term Loan by paying the lesser of: (x) the principal amount thereof ; or (y) the amount that such Disqualified Institution paid to acquire such Term Loans, in each case plus accrued interest, accrued fees and all other amounts (other than principal amounts) payable to it hereunder; and/or (C) require such Disqualified Institution to assign, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in this Section 12.9), all of its interest, rights, and obligations under this Agreement to one or more Eligible Assignees at the lesser of: (x) the principal amount thereof; and (y) the amount that such Disqualified Institution paid to acquire such interests, rights and obligations of such Term Loans, in each case plus accrued interest, accrued fees and all other amounts (other than principal amounts) payable to it hereunder.
 
(iii)          Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Disqualified Institutions: (A) will not: (x) have the right to receive information, reports or other materials provided to Lenders by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any other Lender; (y) attend or participate in meetings attended by the Lenders and the Administrative Agent; or (z) access any electronic site established for the Lenders or confidential communications from counsel to or financial advisors of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders; and (B)(x) for purposes of any consent to any amendment, waiver or modification of, or any action under, and for the purpose of any direction to the Administrative Agent or any Lender to undertake any action (or refrain from taking any action) under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, each Disqualified Institution will be deemed to have consented in the same proportion as the 
 
136





 
Lenders that are not Disqualified Institutions consented to such matter; and (y) for purposes of voting on any Plan, each Disqualified Institution party hereto hereby agrees: (I) not to vote on such Plan; (II) if such Disqualified Institution does vote on such Plan notwithstanding the restriction in the foregoing clause (I), such vote will be deemed not to be in good faith and shall be designated pursuant to Section 1126(e) of the Bankruptcy Code (or any similar provision in any other Debtor Relief Laws), and such vote shall not be counted in determining whether the applicable class has accepted or rejected such Plan in accordance with Section 1126(c) of the Bankruptcy Code (or any similar provision in any other Debtor Relief Laws); and (III) not to contest any request by any party for a determination by the Bankruptcy Court (or other applicable court of competent jurisdiction) effectuating the foregoing clause (II).
 
(iv)          The Administrative Agent shall have the right, and the Borrower hereby expressly authorizes and directs the Administrative Agent, to: (A) post the list of Disqualified Institutions provided by the Borrower and any updates thereto from time to time (collectively, the DQ List) on the Platform, including that portion of the Platform that is designated for public side Lenders; and/or (B) provide the DQ List to each Lender requesting the same.
 
SECTION 12.10         Treatment of Certain Information; Confidentiality.  Each of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Issuing Lender agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed: (a) to its Affiliates and to its and its Related Parties in connection with the Credit Facility, this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or in connection with marketing of services by such Affiliate or Related Party to Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential); (b) to the extent required or requested by, or required to be disclosed to, any regulatory or similar authority purporting to have jurisdiction over such Person or its Related Parties (including any self-regulatory authority, such as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners); (c) to the extent required by Applicable Laws or regulations or in any legal, judicial, administrative or other compulsory process; (d) to any other party hereto; (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies under this Agreement, under any other Loan Document or under any Secured Hedge Agreement or Secured Cash Management Agreement, or any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any Secured Hedge Agreement or Secured Cash Management Agreement, or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder; (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section, to: (i) any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights and obligations under this Agreement; (ii) any actual or prospective party (or its Related Parties) to any swap, derivative or other transaction under which payments are to be made by reference to the Borrower and its obligations, this Agreement or payments hereunder (it being understood that the DQ List may be disclosed to any assignee or Participant, or prospective assignee or Participant, in reliance on this clause (f)); (iii) to an investor or prospective investor in an Approved Fund that also agrees that Information shall be used solely for the purpose of evaluating an investment in such Approved Fund; (iv) to a trustee, collateral manager, servicer, backup servicer, noteholder or secured party in an Approved Fund in connection with the administration, servicing and reporting on the assets serving as collateral for an Approved Fund; or (v) to a nationally recognized rating agency that requires access to information regarding the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, the Loans, and the Loan Documents in connection with ratings issued with respect to an Approved Fund; (g) on a confidential basis to: (i) any rating agency in connection with rating the Borrower or its Subsidiaries or the Credit Facility; or (ii) the CUSIP Service Bureau or any similar agency in connection with the issuance and monitoring of CUSIP numbers with respect to the Credit Facility; (h) with the consent of the Borrower, deal terms and other information customarily reported to Thomson Reuters, other bank market data collectors and similar service providers to the lending industry and service providers to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in connection with the administration of the Loan 
 
137





 
Documents; (i) to the extent such Information: (i) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section; or (ii) becomes available to the Administrative Agent, any Lender, any Issuing Lender or any of their respective Affiliates from a third party that is not, to such Persons knowledge, subject to confidentiality obligations to the Borrower; (j) to governmental regulatory authorities in connection with any regulatory examination of the Administrative Agent or any Lender or in accordance with the Administrative Agents or any Lenders regulatory compliance policy if the Administrative Agent or such Lender deems necessary for the mitigation of claims by those authorities against the Administrative Agent or such Lender or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates; (k) to the extent that such information is independently developed by such Person; or (l) for purposes of establishing a due diligence defense.  For purposes of this Section, Information means all information received from any Credit Party or any Subsidiary thereof relating to any Credit Party or any Subsidiary thereof or any of their respective businesses, other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by any Credit Party or any Subsidiary thereof; provided that, in the case of information received from a Credit Party or any Subsidiary thereof after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential.  Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information.
 
SECTION 12.11         Performance of Duties.  Each of the Credit Partys obligations under this Agreement and each of the other Loan Documents shall be performed by such Credit Party at its sole cost and expense.
 
SECTION 12.12         All Powers Coupled with Interest.  All powers of attorney and other authorizations granted to the Lenders, the Administrative Agent and any Persons designated by the Administrative Agent or any Lender pursuant to any provisions of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents shall be deemed coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable so long as any of the Obligations remain unpaid or unsatisfied, any of the Commitments remain in effect or the Credit Facility has not been terminated.
 
SECTION 12.13         Survival.
 
(a)           All representations and warranties set forth in Article VII and all representations and warranties contained in any certificate, or any of the Loan Documents (including, but not limited to, any such representation or warranty made in or in connection with any amendment thereto) shall constitute representations and warranties made under this Agreement.  All representations and warranties made under this Agreement shall be made or deemed to be made at and as of the Closing Date (except those that are expressly made as of a specific date), shall survive the Closing Date and shall not be waived by the execution and delivery of this Agreement, any investigation made by or on behalf of the Lenders or any borrowing hereunder.
 
(b)           Notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement, the indemnities to which the Administrative Agent and the Lenders are entitled under the provisions of this Article XII and any other provision of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall continue in full force and effect and shall protect the Administrative Agent and the Lenders against events arising after such termination as well as before.
 
SECTION 12.14         Titles and Captions.  Titles and captions of Articles, Sections and subsections in, and the table of contents of, this Agreement are for convenience only, and neither limit nor amplify the provisions of this Agreement.
 
138





 
SECTION 12.15         Severability of Provisions.  Any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document which is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions hereof or thereof or affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction.
 
SECTION 12.16         Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness; Electronic Execution.
 
(a)           Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness.  This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto in different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract.  This Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender, the Swingline Lender and/or the Arranger, constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof.  Except as provided in Section 6.1, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof that, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto.  Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by facsimile or in electronic (i.e., pdf or tif) format shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.
 
(b)           Electronic Execution of Assignments.  The words execution, signed, signature, and words of like import in any Assignment and Assumption shall be deemed to include electronic signatures or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent and as provided for in any Applicable Law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act, or any other similar state 

reement shall remain in effect from the Closing Date through and including the date upon which the Discharge of the Obligations has occurred. Any such termination of this Agreement shall be deemed subject to the provision that this Agreement shall be reinstated if after such termination any portion of any payment in respect of the Obligations shall be rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or reorganization of any Credit Party, or upon or as a result of the appointment of a receiver, intervenor or conservator of, or trustee or similar officer for, any Credit Party or any substantial part of its property, or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made. No termination of this Agreement shall affect the rights and obligations of the parties hereto arising prior to such termination or in respect of any provision of this Agreement which survives such termination.
 
SECTION 12.18         USA PATRIOT Act.  The Administrative Agent and each Lender hereby notifies the Borrower that pursuant to the requirements of the PATRIOT Act, each of them is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each Credit Party, which information includes the name and address of each Credit Party and other information that will allow such Lender to identify each Credit Party in accordance with the PATRIOT Act.
 
SECTION 12.19         Independent Effect of Covenants.  The Borrower expressly acknowledges and agrees that each covenant contained in Articles VIII or IX hereof shall be given independent effect.  Accordingly, the Borrower shall not engage in any transaction or other act otherwise permitted under any covenant contained in Articles VIII or IX, before or after giving effect to such transaction or act, the Borrower shall or would be in breach of any other covenant contained in Articles VIII or IX.
 
139





 
SECTION 12.20         No Advisory or Fiduciary Responsibility.
 
(a)           In connection with all aspects of each transaction contemplated hereby, each Credit Party acknowledges and agrees, and acknowledges its Affiliates understanding, that: (i) the facilities provided for hereunder and any related arranging or other services in connection therewith (including in connection with any amendment, waiver or other modification hereof or of any other Loan Document) are an arms-length commercial transaction between the Borrower and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers and the Lenders, on the other hand, and the Borrower is capable of evaluating and understanding and understands and accepts the terms, risks and conditions of the transactions contemplated hereby and by the other Loan Documents (including any amendment, waiver or other modification hereof or thereof); (ii) in connection with the process leading to such transaction, each of the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers and the Lenders is and has been acting solely as a principal and is not the financial advisor, agent or fiduciary, for the Borrower or any of its Affiliates, stockholders, creditors or employees or any other Person; (iii) none of the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers or the Lenders has assumed or will assume an advisory, agency or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Borrower with respect to any of the transactions contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto, including with respect to any amendment, waiver or other modification hereof or of any other Loan Document (irrespective of whether any Arranger or Lender has advised or is currently advising the Borrower or any of its Affiliates on other matters) and none of the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers or the Lenders has any obligation to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates with respect to the financing transactions contemplated hereby except those obligations expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents; (iv) the Arrangers and the Lenders and their respective Affiliates may be engaged in a broad range of transactions that involve interests that differ from, and may conflict with, those of the Borrower and its Affiliates, and none of the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers or the Lenders has any obligation to disclose any of such interests by virtue of any advisory, agency or fiduciary relationship; and (v) the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers and the Lenders have not provided and will not provide any legal, accounting, regulatory or tax advice with respect to any of the transactions contemplated hereby (including any amendment, waiver or other modification hereof or of any other Loan Document) and the Credit Parties have consulted their own legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent they have deemed appropriate.
 
(b)           Each Credit Party acknowledges and agrees that each Lender, the Arrangers and any Affiliate thereof may lend money to, invest in, and generally engage in any kind of business with any of the Borrower, any Affiliate thereof, or any other Person that may do business with or own securities of any of the foregoing, all as if such Lender, Arranger or Affiliate thereof were not a Lender or Arranger or an Affiliate thereof (or an agent or any other person with any similar role under the Credit Facilities) and without any duty to account therefor to any other Lender, the Arrangers, the Borrower or any Affiliate of the foregoing.  Each Lender, the Arrangers and any Affiliate thereof may accept fees and other consideration from the Borrower or any Affiliate thereof for services in connection with this Agreement, the Credit Facilities or otherwise without having to account for the same to any other Lender, the Arrangers, the Borrower or any Affiliate of the foregoing.
 
SECTION 12.21         Inconsistencies with Other Documents.  In the event there is a conflict or inconsistency between this Agreement and any other Loan Document, the terms of this Agreement shall control; provided that any provision of the Security Documents which imposes additional burdens on the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or further restricts the rights of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or gives the Administrative Agent or Lenders additional rights, shall not be deemed to be in conflict or inconsistent with this Agreement and shall be given full force and effect.
 
SECTION 12.22         Judgment Currency.  If, for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court, it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder or any other Loan Document in one currency into another 
 
140





 
currency, the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Administrative Agent could purchase the first currency with such other currency on the Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is given. The obligation of the Borrower in respect of any such sum due from it to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or any Lender hereunder or under the other Loan Documents shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency (the Judgment Currency) other than that in which such sum is denominated in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement (the Agreement Currency), be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or such Lender, as the case may be, of any sum adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or such Lender, as the case may be, may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase the Agreement Currency with the Judgment Currency. If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or any Lender from the Borrower in the Agreement Currency, the Borrower agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or such Lender, as the case may be, against such loss. If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is greater than the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or any Lender in such currency, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or such Lender, as the case may be, agrees to return the amount of any excess to the Borrower (or to any other Person who may be entitled thereto under applicable law).
 
SECTION 12.23         Releases of Liens and Subsidiary Guarantors.
 
(a)           A Subsidiary Guarantor shall automatically be released from its obligations under the Guaranty Agreement and any other Loan Documents upon the consummation of any transaction permitted by this Agreement as a result of which such Subsidiary Guarantor ceases to be a Subsidiary; provided that, if so required by this Agreement, the Required Lenders (or such other percentage of the Lenders as required by this Agreement) shall have consented pursuant to Section 12.2 to such transaction and the terms of such consent shall not have provided otherwise.  In connection with any termination or release pursuant to this Section 12.23, the Administrative Agent shall (and is hereby irrevocably authorized by each Lender to) execute and deliver to any Credit Party, at such Credit Partys expense, all documents that such Credit Party shall reasonably request to evidence such termination or release.  Any execution and delivery of documents pursuant to this Section 12.23 shall be without recourse to or warranty by the Administrative Agent.
 
(b)           Further, the Administrative Agent shall, upon the written request of the Borrower, release any Subsidiary Guarantor from its obligations under the Guaranty Agreement if such Subsidiary Guarantor becomes an Excluded Subsidiary.
 
(c)           Upon (i) any disposition (other than any lease or license) by any Credit Party (other than to any Credit Party) of any Collateral in a transaction permitted under this Agreement or (ii) the effectiveness of any written consent of the Required Lenders (or such other percentage of Lenders as required by this Agreement) pursuant to Section 12.2 to the release of the security interest created under any Security Document in any Collateral, the security interests in such Collateral created by the Security Documents shall be automatically released.
 
(d)           In addition, the Administrative Agent shall, at the reasonable written request of the Borrower, subordinate any Lien on any Collateral to the holder of any Liens on such Collateral permitted under Section 9.2(i).
 
(e)           In connection with any termination, release or subordination pursuant to this Section 12.23, the Administrative Agent shall execute and deliver to any Credit Party, at such Credit Partys 
 
141





 
expense, all documents that such Credit Party shall reasonably request to evidence such termination, release or subordination.
