ARTICLE II. CREDIT FACILITY
 
Section 2.1.                                Term Loans.
 
(a)                                 Making of Term Loans.  Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, each Term Loan Lender severally and not jointly agrees to make Term Loans to the Borrower on the Effective Date in the aggregate principal amount equal to the amount of such Lenders Term Loan Commitment. Upon a Lenders funding of a Term Loan, the Term Loan Commitment of such Lender shall terminate as to the amount of such Term Loan. All unfunded Term Loan Commitments shall expire upon disbursement of the Term Loans on the Effective Date.  All Existing Term Loans remaining outstanding after the date hereof shall be deemed to have been funded pursuant hereto, and shall be subject to and governed by the terms and conditions hereof.
 
(b)                                 Requests for Term Loans.  Unless waived by the Administrative Agent, not later than 1:00 p.m. Central time at least 3 Business Days prior to the anticipated Effective Date, the Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent notice requesting that the Term Loan Lenders make the Term Loans on the Effective Date, and specifying the aggregate principal amount of Term Loans to be borrowed, the Type of the Term Loans, and if such Term Loans are to be LIBOR Loans, the initial Interest Period for the Term Loans.  Such notice shall be irrevocable once given and binding on the Borrower.  Upon receipt of such notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Term Loan Lender.
 
(c)                                  Funding of Term Loans.  Each Term Loan Lender shall deposit an amount equal to the Term Loan to be made by such Term Loan Lender to the Borrower with the Administrative Agent at the Principal Office, in immediately available funds, not later than 11:00 a.m. Central time on the Effective Date.  Subject to fulfillment of all applicable conditions set forth herein, the Administrative Agent shall make available to the Borrower in the account specified by the Borrower in the Disbursement Instruction Agreement, not later than 2:00 p.m. Central time on the such date, the proceeds of such amounts received by the Administrative Agent.  The Borrower may not reborrow any portion of the Term Loans once repaid.
 
(d)                                 Assumptions Regarding Funding by Lenders.  With respect to Term Loans made hereunder, unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified by any Lender that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent a Term Loan to be made by such Lender in connection with any borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender will make the proceeds of such Term Loan available to the Administrative Agent in accordance with this Section, and the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to), in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower the amount of such Term Loan to be provided by such Lender.  In such event, if such Lender does not make available to the Administrative Agent the proceeds of such Term Loan, then such Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent on demand the amount of such Term Loan with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such Term Loan is made available to the Borrower but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation and (ii) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans. If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay the amount of such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period.  If such Lender pays to the Administrative Agent the amount of such Term Loan, the amount so paid shall constitute such Lenders Term Loan included in the borrowing. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make available the proceeds of a Term Loan to be made by such Lender.
 
33





 
Section 2.2.                                Rates and Payment of Interest on Loans.
 
(a)                                 Rates.  The Borrower promises to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Loan made by such Lender for the period from and including the date of the making of such Loan to but excluding the date such Loan shall be paid in full, at the following per annum rates:
 
(i)                                     during such periods as such Loan is a Base Rate Loan, at the Base Rate (as in effect from time to time), plus the Applicable Margin for Base Rate Loans; and
 
(ii)                                  during such periods as such Loan is a LIBOR Loan, at LIBOR for such Loan for the Interest Period therefor, plus the Applicable Margin for LIBOR Loans.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, while an Event of Default exists, the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender, as the case may be, interest at the Post-Default Rate on the outstanding principal amount of any Loan made by such Lender, and on any other amount payable by the Borrower hereunder or under the Notes held by such Lender to or for the account of such Lender (including without limitation, accrued but unpaid interest to the extent permitted under Laws).
 
(b)                                 Payment of Interest.  All accrued and unpaid interest on the outstanding principal amount of each Loan shall be payable (i) (x) with respect to any LIBOR Loan, on the last day of each Interest Period; provided, however, that if any Interest Period for a LIBOR Loan exceeds three (3) months, all accrued and unpaid interest on the outstanding principal amount of each such LIBOR Loan shall also be payable on the respective dates that fall every three (3) months after the beginning of such Interest Period, and (y) with respect to any Base Rate Loan, on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December, and (ii) on any date on which the principal balance of such Loan is due and payable in full (whether at maturity, due to acceleration or otherwise).  Interest payable at the Post-Default Rate shall be payable from time to time on demand.  All determinations by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate hereunder shall be conclusive and binding on the Lenders and the Borrower for all purposes, absent manifest error.
 
(c)                                  Borrower Information Used to Determine Applicable Interest Rates.  The parties understand that the applicable interest rate for the Obligations and certain fees set forth herein may be determined and/or adjusted from time to time based upon certain financial ratios and/or other information to be provided or certified to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower (the Borrower Information).  If it is subsequently determined that any such Borrower Information was incorrect (for whatever reason, including without limitation because of a subsequent restatement of earnings by the Borrower) at the time it was delivered to the Administrative Agent, and if the applicable interest rate or fees calculated for any period were lower than they should have been had the correct information been timely provided, then, such interest rate and such fees for such period shall be automatically recalculated using correct Borrower Information.  The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower in writing of any additional interest and fees due because of such recalculation, and the Borrower, shall pay such additional interest or fees due to the Administrative Agent, for the account of each Lender, within 5 Business Days of such written notice.  Any recalculation of interest or fees required by this provision shall survive the termination of this Agreement, for a period of 180 days, and this provision shall not in any way limit any of the Administrative Agents, or any Lenders other rights under this Agreement.
 
Section 2.3.                                Number of Interest Periods.
 
There may be no more than three (3) different Interest Periods outstanding at the same time.

Section 2.6.                                Continuation.
 
So long as no Default or Event of Default exists, the Borrower may on any Business Day, with respect to any LIBOR Loan, elect to maintain such LIBOR Loan or any portion thereof as a LIBOR Loan by selecting a new Interest Period for such LIBOR Loan.  Each Continuation of a LIBOR Loan shall be in an aggregate minimum amount of $5,000,000 and integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess of that amount, and each new Interest Period selected under this Section shall commence on the last day of the immediately preceding Interest Period.  Each selection of a new Interest Period shall be made by the Borrower giving to the Administrative Agent a Notice of Continuation not later than 11:00 a.m. Central time on the third Business Day prior to the date of any such Continuation.  Such notice by the Borrower of a Continuation shall be by telecopy, electronic mail or other similar form of communication in the form of a Notice of Continuation, specifying (a) the proposed date of such Continuation, (b) the LIBOR Loans and portions thereof subject to such Continuation and (c) the duration of the selected Interest Period, all of which shall be specified in such manner as is necessary to comply with all limitations on Loans outstanding hereunder.  Each Notice of Continuation shall be irrevocable by and binding on the Borrower once given.  Promptly after receipt of a Notice of Continuation, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the proposed Continuation.  If the Borrower shall fail to select in a timely manner a new Interest Period for any LIBOR Loan in accordance with this Section, such Loan will automatically, on the last day of the current Interest Period therefor, continue as a LIBOR Loan with an Interest Period of one month; provided, however that if a Default or Event of Default exists, such Loan will automatically, on the last day of the current Interest Period therefor, Convert into a Base Rate Loan notwithstanding the first sentence of Section 2.7. or the Borrowers failure to comply with any of the terms of such Section.
 
Section 2.7.                                Conversion.
 
The Borrower may on any Business Day, upon the Borrowers giving of a Notice of Conversion to the Administrative Agent by telecopy, electronic mail or other similar form of communication, Convert all or a portion of a Loan of one Type into a Loan of another Type; provided, however, a Base Rate Loan may not be Converted into a LIBOR Loan if a Default or Event of Default exists.  Each Conversion of Base Rate Loans into LIBOR Loans shall be in an aggregate minimum amount of $5,000,000 and integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess of that amount.  Each such Notice of Conversion shall be given not later than 11:00 a.m. Central time 3 Business Days prior to the date of any proposed Conversion.  Promptly after receipt of a Notice of Conversion, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the proposed Conversion.  Subject to the restrictions specified above, each Notice of Conversion shall be by telecopy, electronic mail or other similar form of communication in the form of a Notice of Conversion specifying (a) the requested date of such Conversion, (b) the Type of Loan to be Converted, (c) the portion of such Type of Loan to be

(a)                                 Notes.  Except in the case of a Term Loan Lender that has notified the Administrative Agent in writing that it elects not to receive a Term Note, the Term Loan made by a Term Loan Lender shall, in addition to this Agreement, also be evidenced by a Term Note, payable to the order of such Term Loan Lender in a principal amount equal to the amount of its Term Loan and otherwise duly completed.
 
(b)                                 Records.  The date, amount, interest rate, Type and duration of Interest Periods (if applicable) of each Loan made by each Lender to the Borrower, and each payment made on account of the principal thereof, shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by the Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of business.  The accounts or records maintained by the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations.  In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error.

(b)                                 Conditions to Effectiveness of Extensions.  As a condition precedent to each such extension, the Borrower shall pay to Administrative Agent for the pro rata benefit of the Term Loan Lenders, an extension fee equal to (A) Extension Fee Percentage (as hereinafter defined) multiplied by (B) the outstanding principal balance of the Loans at the time of extension and deliver to the Administrative Agent a certificate of each Loan Party dated as of the Existing Maturity Date (in sufficient copies for each Lender) signed by a Responsible Officer of such Loan Party (i) approving or consenting to such extension (and attaching resolutions adopted by such Loan Party approving or consenting to such extension to the extent required under such Loan Partys Organization Documents) and (ii) in the case of the Borrower, certifying that, immediately before and after giving effect to such extension, (A) the representations and warranties contained in Article VII and the other Loan Documents are true and correct on and as of the Existing Maturity Date, except to the extent that such representations and warranties specifically refer to an earlier date, in which case they were true and correct as of such earlier date, and except that for purposes of this Section 2.12, the representations and warranties contained in Section 7.11(e) shall be deemed to refer to the most recent statements furnished pursuant to Section 9.1 and 9.2, (B) the Borrower is in compliance with all of the financial covenants set forth in Section 10.1, and (C) no Default exists.  As used herein, Extension Fee Percentage shall mean 0.10% (ten basis points) for the first extension and 0.15% (15 basis points) for the second extension.
 
ARTICLE III. PAYMENTS, FEES AND OTHER GENERAL PROVISIONS
 
Section 3.1.                                Payments.
 
(a)                                 Payments by Borrower.  Except to the extent otherwise provided herein, all payments of principal, interest, Fees and other amounts to be made by the Borrower under this Agreement, the Notes or any other Loan Document shall be made in Dollars, in immediately available funds, without setoff, deduction or counterclaim (excluding Taxes required to be withheld pursuant to Section 3.10.), to the Administrative Agent at the Principal Office, not later than 1:00 p.m. Central time on the date on which such payment shall become due (each such payment made after such time on such due date to be deemed to have been made on the next succeeding Business Day).  Each payment received by the Administrative Agent for the account of a Lender under this Agreement or any Note shall be paid to such Lender by wire transfer of immediately available funds in accordance with the wiring instructions provided by such Lender to the Administrative Agent from time to time, for the account of such Lender at the applicable Lending Office of such Lender.  If the due date of any payment under this Agreement or any other Loan Document would otherwise fall on a day which is not a Business Day such date shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and interest shall continue to accrue at the rate, if any, applicable to such payment for the period of such extension.
 
(b)                                 Presumptions Regarding Payments by Borrower.  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance
 
38





 
herewith and may (but shall not be obligated to), in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due.  In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent on demand that amount so distributed to such Lender, with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.
 
Section 3.2.                                Pro Rata Treatment.
 
Except to the extent otherwise provided herein: (a) the making of Term Loans under Section 2.1.(a) shall be made from the Term Loan Lenders, pro rata according to the amounts of their respective Term Loan Commitments; (b) each payment or prepayment of principal of Term Loans shall be made for the account of the Term Loan Lenders pro rata in accordance with the respective unpaid principal amounts of the Term Loans held by them; (c) each payment of interest on Term Loans shall be made for the account of the Term Loan Lenders, as applicable, pro rata in accordance with the amounts of interest on such Term Loans, as applicable, then due and payable to the respective Lenders; (d) the Conversion and Continuation of Term Loans of a particular Type (other than Conversions provided for by Sections 5.1.(c) and 5.5.) shall be made pro rata among the Term Loan Lenders, as applicable, according to the amounts of their respective Term Loans, as applicable, and the then current Interest Period for each Lenders portion of each such Loan of such Type shall be coterminous.
 
Section 3.3.                                Sharing of Payments by Lenders.
 
If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans or other Obligations owing to such Lender resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and accrued interest thereon or other such Obligation greater than the share thereof as provided in Section 3.2. or Section 11.5., as applicable, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and such other Obligations owing to the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the applicable Lenders ratably in accordance with Section 3.2. or Section 11.5., as applicable; provided that:
 
(i)                                     if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and
 
(ii)                                  the provisions of this Section shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender), or (y) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of, or sale of a participation in, any of its Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates (as to which the provisions of this Section shall apply).
 
The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under Applicable Law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.
 
39





 
Section 3.4.                                Several Obligations.
 
No Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make a Loan or to perform any other obligation to be made or performed by such other Lender hereunder, and the failure of any Lender to make a Loan or to perform any other obligation to be made or performed by it hereunder shall not relieve the obligation of any other Lender to make any Loan or to perform any other obligation to be made or performed by such other Lender.
 
Section 3.5.                                Fees.
 
(a)                                 Closing Fee.  On the Effective Date, the Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent and each Lender all fees then due and payable as have been agreed to in writing by the Borrower, the Arranger and the Administrative Agent in the Fee Letter or otherwise.
 
(b)                                 Administrative and Other Fees.  The Borrower agrees to pay the administrative and other fees of the Administrative Agent as provided in the applicable Fee Letter and as may be otherwise agreed to in writing from time to time by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent.
 
Section 3.6.                                Computations.
 
Unless otherwise expressly set forth herein, any accrued interest on any Loan, any Fees or any other Obligations due hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and the actual number of days elapsed.
 
Section 3.7.                                Usury.
 
In no event shall the amount of interest due or payable on the Loans or other Obligations exceed the maximum rate of interest allowed by Laws and, if any such payment is paid by the Borrower or any other Loan Party or received by any Lender, then such excess sum shall be credited as a payment of principal, unless the Borrower shall notify the respective Lender in writing that the Borrower elects to have such excess sum returned to it forthwith.  It is the express intent of the parties hereto that the Borrower not pay and the Lenders not receive, directly or indirectly, in any manner whatsoever, interest in excess of that which may be lawfully paid by the Borrower under Laws.  The parties hereto hereby agree and stipulate that the only charge imposed upon the Borrower for the use of money in connection with this Agreement is and shall be the interest specifically described in Section 2.2.(a)(i) through (iv).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties hereto further agree and stipulate that all agency fees, syndication fees, facility fees, closing fees, letter of credit fees, underwriting fees, default charges, late charges, funding or breakage charges, increased cost charges, attorneys fees and reimbursement for costs and expenses paid by the Administrative Agent or any Lender to third parties or for damages incurred by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, in each case, in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, are charges made to compensate the Administrative Agent or any such Lender for underwriting or administrative services and costs or losses performed or incurred, and to be performed or incurred, by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in connection with this Agreement and shall under no circumstances be deemed to be charges for the use of money.  All charges other than charges for the use of money shall be fully earned and nonrefundable when due.
 
Section 3.8.                                Statements of Account.
 
The Administrative Agent will account to the Borrower monthly with a statement of Loans, accrued interest and Fees, charges and payments made pursuant to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents,
 
40





 
and such account rendered by the Administrative Agent shall be deemed conclusive upon the Borrower absent manifest error.  The failure of the Administrative Agent to deliver such a statement of accounts shall not relieve or discharge the Borrower from any of its obligations hereunder.
 
Section 3.9.                                Defaulting Lenders.
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as such Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by Laws:
 
(a)                                 Waivers and Amendments.  Such Defaulting Lenders right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in the definition of Requisite Lenders and in Section 13.6.
 
(b)                                 Defaulting Lender Waterfall.  Any payment of principal, interest, Fees or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Article XI. or otherwise) or received by the Administrative Agent from a Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 13.3. shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows:  first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder; second, as the Borrower may request (so long as no Default or Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent; third, if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to be held in a deposit account and released pro rata in order to satisfy such Defaulting Lenders potential future funding obligations with respect to Loans under this Agreement; fourth, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement; fifth, so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and sixth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction. Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant to this subsection shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.
 
(c)                                  Certain Fees.
 
(i)                                     No Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive any Fee payable under Section 3.5.(b) for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and the Borrower shall not be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender).
 
(ii)                                  With respect to any Fee not required to be paid to any Defaulting Lender pursuant to the immediately preceding clauses (i), the Borrower shall not be required to pay the remaining amount of any such Fee.
 
(d)                                 Defaulting Lender Cure.  If the Borrower and the Administrative Agent agree in writing that a Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein,
 
41





 
that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans to be held pro rata by the Lenders in accordance with their respective pro rata shares, whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to Fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lenders having been a Defaulting Lender.
 
(e)                                  Purchase of Defaulting Lenders Commitment.  During any period that a Lender is a Defaulting Lender for which it has an unfunded Commitment, the Borrower may, by the Borrower giving written notice thereof to the Administrative Agent, such Defaulting Lender and the other Lenders, demand that such Defaulting Lender assign its Commitment and Loans to an Eligible Assignee subject to and in accordance with the provisions of Section 13.5.(b).  No party hereto shall have any obligation whatsoever to initiate any such replacement or to assist in finding an Eligible Assignee.  In addition, any Lender who is not a Defaulting Lender may, but shall not be obligated, in its sole discretion, to acquire the face amount of all or a portion of such Defaulting Lenders Commitment and Loans via an assignment subject to and in accordance with the provisions of Section 13.5.(b).  In connection with any such assignment, such Defaulting Lender shall promptly execute all documents reasonably requested to effect such assignment, including an appropriate Assignment and Assumption and, notwithstanding Section 13.5.(b), shall pay to the Administrative Agent an assignment fee in the amount of $7,500.  The exercise by the Borrower of its rights under this Section shall be at the Borrowers sole cost and expense and at no cost or expense to the Administrative Agent or any of the Lenders.
 
Section 3.10.                         Taxes.
 
(a)                                 Laws.  For purposes of this Section, the term Laws includes FATCA.
 
(b)                                 Payments Free of Taxes.  Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower or any other Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by Laws.  If any Laws (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable Withholding Agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a Withholding Agent, then the applicable Withholding Agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with Laws and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the Borrower or other applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made.
 
(c)                                  Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower.  The Borrower and the other Loan Parties shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with Laws, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes.
 
(d)                                 Indemnification by the Borrower.  The Borrower and the other Loan Parties shall jointly and severally indemnify each Recipient, within 10 days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not
 
42





 
such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
 
(e)                                  Indemnification by the Lenders.  Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that the Borrower or another Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for, or paid such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower and the other Loan Parties to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lenders failure to comply with the provisions of Section 13.5. relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this subsection.  The provisions of this subsection shall continue to inure to the benefit of an Administrative Agent following its resignation as Administrative Agent.
 
(f)                                   Evidence of Payments.  As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by the Borrower or any other Loan Party to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section, the Borrower or such other Loan Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
 
(g)                                  Status of Lenders.
 
(i)                                     Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding.  In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by Laws or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in the immediately following clauses (ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D)) shall not be required if in the Lenders reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.
 
43





 
(ii)                                  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that the Borrower is a U.S. Person:
 
(A)                               any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), an electronic copy (or an original if requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent) of an executed IRS Form W-9 (or any successor form) certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax;
 
(B)                               any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:
 
(I)                                   in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, an electronic copy (or one or two originals if requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent) of a properly completed and executed IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the interest article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the business profits or other income article of such tax treaty;
 
(II)                              an electronic copy (or one or two originals if requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent) of a property completed and executed IRS Form W-8ECI;
 
(III)                         in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit [G]-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a bank within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code, a 10 percent shareholder of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code, or a controlled foreign corporation described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code (a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate) and (y) two property completed and executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E; or
 
(IV)                          to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, an electronic copy (or one or two originals if requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent) of a properly completed and executed IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit [G]-2 or Exhibit [G]-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate
 
44





 
substantially in the form of Exhibit [G]-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner;
 
(C)                               any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), an electronic copy (or an original if requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent) of any other form prescribed by Laws as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by Laws to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and
 
(D)                               if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by Laws and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by Laws (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Internal Revenue Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lenders obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.  Solely for purposes of this clause (D), FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
 
Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.
 
(h)                                 Treatment of Certain Refunds.  If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund).  Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this subsection (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental 

ired to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this subsection, in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this subsection the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid.  This subsection shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available
 
45





 
its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.
 
(i)                                     Survival.  Each partys obligations under this Section shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document.
 
ARTICLE IV. ADDITION AND REMOVAL OF UNENCUMBERED PROPERTIES
 
Section 4.1.                                Addition of Unencumbered Properties.
 
The Borrower may at any time and from time to time designate additional Unencumbered Properties meeting the definition of an Unencumbered Property by providing an updated Schedule 7.1(s) and the appropriate Subsidiary Guarantees, at which time such additional Unencumbered Properties shall be included for purposes of determining the Borrowers compliance with the financial covenants under Sections 10.1(f), (g) and (h) and the amount that may be borrowed hereunder.
 
Section 4.2.                                Removal of Unencumbered Properties.
 
The Borrower may at any time and from time to time remove Unencumbered Properties by providing an updated Schedule 7.1(s) reflecting which Properties will no longer constitute Unencumbered Properties; provided that in connection therewith the Borrower shall certify to the Administrative Agent that, following removal of such Unencumbered Property, the Borrower continues to comply with Sections 10.1(f), (g) and (h) and, provided Borrower complies with Sections 10.1(f), (g) and (h) and there is no Event of Default at such time, such Property shall no longer constitute an Unencumbered Property for purposes hereof.
 
ARTICLE V. YIELD PROTECTION, ETC.
 
Section 5.1.                                Additional Costs; Capital Adequacy.
 
(a)                                 Capital Adequacy.  If any Lender determines that any Regulatory Change affecting such Lender or any lending office of such Lender or such Lenders holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lenders capital or on the capital of such Lenders holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by such Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or such Lenders holding company could have achieved but for such Regulatory Change (taking into consideration such Lenders policies and the policies of such Lenders holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lenders holding company for any such reduction suffered.  Each Lender agrees that, in the event that it submits any demand for payment under this Section 5.1(a) it shall, as part of making such demand, have made a good faith determination (which determination shall be conclusive), that it is concurrently making similar demands of other (but not necessarily all) customers similar situated.
 
(b)                                 Additional Costs.  If any Regulatory Change shall:
 
(i)                                     impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or
 
46





 
credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement reflected in LIBOR);
 
(ii)                                  subject any Lender to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; or
 
(iii)                               impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense (other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or LIBOR Loans made by such Lender;
 
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any LIBOR Loan or of maintaining its obligation to make any such LIBOR Loan, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) (each of the foregoing costs or reductions, Additional Costs) then, upon request of such Lender, the Borrower will pay to such Lender, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such Additional Costs.  Each Lender agrees that any Additional Cost being asserted by Lender pursuant to this Section 5.1(b) shall be consistent with the costs being assessed against other (but not necessarily all) borrowers are similarly situated to Borrower.
 
(c)                                  Lenders Suspension of LIBOR Loans.  Without limiting the effect of the provisions of the immediately preceding subsections (a) and (b), if by reason of any Regulatory Change, any Lender either (i) incurs Additional Costs based on or measured by the excess above a specified level of the amount of a category of deposits or other liabilities of such Lender that includes deposits by reference to which the interest rate on LIBOR Loans is determined as provided in this Agreement or a category of extensions of credit or other assets of such Lender that includes LIBOR Loans or (ii) becomes subject to restrictions on the amount of such a category of liabilities or assets that it may hold, then, if such Lender so elects by notice to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the obligation of such Lender to make or Continue, or to Convert Base Rate Loans into, LIBOR Loans shall be suspended until such Regulatory Change ceases to be in effect (in which case the provisions of Section 5.5 shall apply).
 
(d)                                 Notification and Determination of Additional Costs.  Each of the Administrative Agent, and each Lender, as the case may be, agrees to notify the Borrower (and in the case of a Lender, to notify the Administrative Agent) of any event occurring after the Agreement Date entitling the Administrative Agent or such Lender to compensation under any of the preceding subsections of this Section as promptly as practicable; provided, however, that the failure of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to give such notice shall not release the Borrower from any of its obligations hereunder.  The Administrative Agent and each Lender, as the case may be, agrees to furnish to the Borrower (and in the case of a Lender to the Administrative Agent as well) a certificate setting forth the basis and amount of each request for compensation under this Section. Such certificate shall be prima facie evidence of the accuracy thereof. The Borrower shall pay the Administrative Agent and or any such Lender, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
 
(e)                                  Delay in Requests.  Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lenders right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than six months prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Regulatory Change giving rise to such increased costs or reductions, and of
 
47





 
such Lenders intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Regulatory Change giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the six-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).
 
Section 5.2.                                Alternate Rate of Interest.
 
(a)                                 Suspension of Adjusted LIBO Rate Loans.  Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, unless and until a Replacement Rate is implemented in accordance with clause (b) below, if, on or prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a LIBOR Rate:
 
(i)                                     the Administrative Agent reasonably determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the LIBOR for such Interest Period; or
 
(ii)                                  the Administrative Agent is advised by the Requisite Lenders that LIBOR for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining their Loans (or its Loan) for such Interest Period.
 
then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders by telephone or in writing as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist (or until a Replacement Rate is implemented in accordance with clause (b) below) (which it shall, in each case, do promptly upon becoming aware thereof), any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Loan to, or continuation of any Loan as, a LIBOR Loan shall be ineffective.  Upon receipt of any such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a conversion to or continuation of Libor Loans or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a comparison to a Base Rate Loan.
 
(b)                                 Replacement Rate.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in clause (a) above, if the Administrative Agent has made the determination (such determination to be conclusive absent manifest error), that (i) the circumstances described in Sections 5.2(a) have arisen and that such circumstances are unlikely to be temporary, (ii)  any applicable interest rate specified herein is no longer a widely recognized benchmark rate for newly originated loans in the U.S. syndicated loan market in the applicable currency or (iii) the applicable supervisor or administrator (if any) of any applicable interest rate specified herein or any Governmental Authority having, or purporting to have, jurisdiction over the Administrative Agent has made a public statement identifying a specific date after which any applicable interest rate specified herein shall no longer be used for determining interest rates for loans in the U.S. syndicated loan market in the applicable currency, then the Administrative Agent may, to the extent practicable (after consultation with the Borrower and as determined by the Administrative Agent giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similar U.S. Dollar denominated syndicated credit facilities for such alternative benchmarks), establish a replacement interest rate (the Replacement Rate), in which case, the Replacement Rate shall, subject to the next two sentences, replace such applicable interest rate, for all purposes under the Loan Documents unless and until (A) an event described in Section 5.2(b)(i), (b)(ii) or (b)(iii) occurs with respect to the Replacement Rate or (B) the Administrative Agent (or the Requisite Lenders through the Administrative Agent) notifies the Borrower that the Replacement Rate does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the Lenders of funding the Loans bearing interest at the Replacement Rate.  In connection with the establishment and application of the Replacement Rate, this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be amended solely with the consent of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, as may be necessary or appropriate, in the opinion of the Administrative Agent, to effect the provisions of this Section 5.2(b).  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement
 
48





 
or the other Loan Documents (including, without limitation, Section 13.6), such amendment shall become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement so long as the Administrative Agent shall not have received, within five (5) Business Days of the delivery of such amendment to the Lenders, written notices from such Lenders that in the aggregate constitute Requisite Lenders, with each such notice stating that such Lender objects to such amendment (which such notice shall note with specificity the particular provisions of the amendment to which such Lender objects).  To the extent the Replacement Rate is approved by the Administrative Agent in connection with this clause (b), the Replacement Rate shall be applied in a manner consistent with market practice; provided that, in each case, to the extent such market practice is not administratively feasible for the Administrative Agent, such Replacement Rate shall be applied as otherwise reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent (it being understood that any such modification by the Administrative Agent shall not require the consent of, or consultation with, any of the Lenders).  Notwithstanding anything else herein, any definition of Replacement Rate shall provide that in no event shall such Replacement Rate be less than zero for purposes of this Agreement.
 
Section 5.3.                                Illegality.
 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any Lender shall reasonably determine that any Laws have made it unlawful for such Lender to honor its obligation to make or maintain LIBOR Loans hereunder, provided Lender has made a similar determination with respect to similarly situated loans, then such Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower thereof (with a copy of such notice to the Administrative Agent) and such Lenders obligation to make or Continue, or to Convert Loans of any other Type into, LIBOR Loans shall be suspended, until such time as such Lender may again make and maintain LIBOR Loans (in which case the provisions of Section 5.5. shall be applicable).
 
Section 5.4.                                Compensation.
 
The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender, upon the request of the Administrative Agent, such amount or amounts as the Administrative Agent shall determine (which determination shall be prima facie evidence) shall be sufficient to compensate such Lender for any loss, cost or expense (but excluding loss of profit) attributable to:
 
(a)                                 any payment or prepayment (whether mandatory or optional) of a LIBOR Loan, or Conversion of a LIBOR Loan, made by such Lender for any reason (including, without limitation, acceleration) on a date other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan; or
 
(b)                                 any failure by the Borrower for any reason (including, without limitation, the failure of any of the applicable conditions precedent specified in Section 6.2. to be satisfied) to borrow a LIBOR Loan from such Lender on the date for such borrowing, or to Convert a Base Rate Loan into a LIBOR Loan or Continue a LIBOR Loan on the requested date of such Conversion or Continuation.
 
Upon the Borrowers request, the Administrative Agent shall provide the Borrower with a statement setting forth the basis for requesting such compensation and the method for determining the amount thereof.  Any such statement shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
 
Section 5.5.                                Treatment of Affected Loans.
 
(a)                                 If the obligation of any Lender to make LIBOR Loans or to Continue, or to Convert Base Rate Loans into, LIBOR Loans shall be suspended pursuant to Section 5.1(c), Section 5.2. or Section 5.3.
 
49





 
then such Lenders LIBOR Loans shall be automatically Converted into Base Rate Loans on the last day(s) of the then current Interest Period(s) for LIBOR Loans (or, in the case of a Conversion required by Section 5.1(c), Section 5.2., or Section 5.3. on such earlier date as such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, may specify to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent, as applicable)) and, unless and until such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, gives notice as provided below that the circumstances specified in Section 5.1(c), Section 5.2. or Section 5.3. that gave rise to such Conversion no longer exist:
 
(i)                                     to the extent that such Lenders LIBOR Loans have been so Converted, all payments and prepayments of principal that would otherwise be applied to such Lenders LIBOR Loans shall be applied instead to its Base Rate Loans; and
 
(ii)                                  all Loans that would otherwise be made or Continued by such Lender as LIBOR Loans shall be made or Continued instead as Base Rate Loans, and all Base Rate Loans of such Lender that would otherwise be Converted into LIBOR Loans shall remain as Base Rate Loans.
 
If such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, gives notice to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent, as applicable) that the circumstances specified in Section 5.1(c), Section 5.2. or 5.3. that gave rise to the Conversion of such Lenders LIBOR Loans pursuant to this Section no longer exist (which such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, agrees to do promptly upon such circumstances ceasing to exist) at a time when LIBOR Loans made by other Lenders are outstanding, then such Lenders Base Rate Loans shall be automatically Converted, on the first day(s) of the next succeeding Interest Period(s) for such outstanding LIBOR Loans, to the extent necessary so that, after giving effect thereto, all Loans held by the Lenders holding LIBOR Loans and by such Lender are held pro rata (as to principal amounts, Types and Interest Periods) in accordance with their respective Commitments.
 
Section 5.6.                                Replacement of Lenders.
 
If (a) a Lender requests compensation pursuant to Section 3.10. or 5.1., and the Requisite Lenders are not also doing the same or (b) the obligation of any Lender to make LIBOR Loans or to Continue, or to Convert Base Rate Loans into, LIBOR Loans shall be suspended pursuant to Section 5.1.(c), 5.2 or 5.3. but the obligation of the Requisite Lenders shall not have been suspended under such Sections, and in the case of clause (a) or (b) such Lender has declined or is unable to designate a different Lending Office in accordance with Section 5.7., or (c) a Lender is a Defaulting Lender or a Non-Consenting Lender, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, so long as there does not then exist any Default or Event of Default, demand that such Lender, and upon such demand such Lender shall promptly, assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 13.5.(b)), all of its interests, rights (other than its existing rights to payments pursuant to Section 3.10. or Section 5.1. and rights to indemnification under Section 13.9.) and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an Eligible Assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that:
 
(i)                                     the Borrower shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the assignment fee (if any) specified in Section 13.5.(b)(iv);
 
(ii)                                  such Lender shall have received payment of (x) the aggregate principal balance of all Loans then owing to the such Lender, plus (y) any accrued but unpaid interest thereon and accrued but unpaid fees owing to such Lender, or any other amount as may be mutually agreed upon by such Lender and Eligible Assignee;
 
50





 
(iii)                               in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 5.1. or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 3.10., such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter;
 
(iv)                              such assignment does not conflict with Applicable Law; and
 
(v)                                 in the case of any assignment resulting from a Lender becoming a Non-Consenting Lender, the applicable assignee shall have consented to the applicable consent, approval, amendment or waiver .
 
A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.
 
Section 5.7.                                Change of Lending Office.
 
If any Lender requests compensation under Section 5.1., or requires the Borrower to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.10., then such Lender shall (at the written request of the Borrower) use reasonable efforts to designate a different Lending Office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (a) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.10. or Section 5.1., as the case may be, in the future, and (b) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender.  The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
 
Section 5.8.                                Assumptions Concerning Funding of LIBOR Loans.
 
Calculation of all amounts payable to a Lender under Section 5.4 shall be made as though such Lender had actually funded LIBOR Loans through the purchase of deposits in the relevant market bearing interest at the rate applicable to such LIBOR Loans in an amount equal to the amount of the LIBOR Loans and having a maturity comparable to the relevant Interest Period; provided, however, that each Lender may fund each of its LIBOR Loans in any manner it sees fit and the foregoing assumption shall be used only for calculation of amounts payable under Section 5.4.

Section 8.13.                         Guarantors.
 
(a)                                 The Borrower shall cause each of its Subsidiaries that owns a Property that is included as an Unencumbered Property and so designated by Borrower for purposes of determining Borrowers compliance with the financial covenants contained in this Agreement to execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent the Subsidiary Guaranty as required under Article IV above.  For any Property added to the pool of Unencumbered Properties after the date hereof (unless owned by an Exchange Fee Titleholder), Borrower shall cause the Subsidiary owning such Unencumbered Property to execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent, on or prior to the date that such Property is included as an Unencumbered Property for purposes of determining Borrowers compliance with the financial covenants contained in this Agreement, a joinder in the Subsidiary Guaranty, together with supporting organizational and authority documents and opinions similar to those provided with respect to the Borrower and the initial Subsidiary Guarantors under Section 4.01.  If Borrower designates a Property that is owned by an Exchange Fee Titleholder to be included as an Unencumbered Property, then the Subsidiary of Borrower that is master leasing such Property shall execute a joinder to the Subsidiary Guaranty and shall be a Subsidiary Guarantor during the period of time that the exchange is pending.  If Borrower designates a Property that is owned by an Exchange Property Owner to be included as an Unencumbered Property during the period of time that the Exchange Beneficial Interests or tenant in common interests are being marketed, then the Exchange Depositor or the Subsidiary owning tenant in common interests that have not been sold, as the case may be, shall execute a joinder to the Subsidiary Guaranty and shall be a Subsidiary Guarantor during the period of time (not to exceed 24 months) during which the sale of Exchange Beneficial Interests or tenant in common interests is pending, but only for so long as such Property remains an Unencumbered Property.  For Unencumbered Properties owned by an Exchange Fee Titleholder, upon completion or termination of the reverse exchange, if Borrower desires the applicable Property to remain an Unencumbered Property, Borrower, or a Subsidiary of Borrower shall acquire all of the ownership interests of the Exchange Fee Titleholder or title to such Unencumbered Property and at such time the entity that was previously the Exchange Fee Titleholder, but has become a Subsidiary of the Borrower, or if fee title is acquired, the Subsidiary acquiring fee title will execute a joinder to the Subsidiary Guaranty and become a Subsidiary Guarantor, and the entity that had previously been master leasing such Property shall be automatically released from the Subsidiary Guaranty.
 
(b)                                 The Subsidiary Guarantors may be released at the request of the Borrower once the Borrower or the Trust receives investment grade ratings from two of S&P, Moodys or Fitch, provided that
 
63





 
such Subsidiary Guarantors are also released from any other unsecured debt or guaranties of Indebtedness. Following such release, any Subsidiary that (x) owns any property that is an Unencumbered Property and (y) has any outstanding recourse Indebtedness shall be required to be a Subsidiary Guarantor in order for such property to be treated as an Unencumbered Property.  In addition, once the Borrower or the Trust receives investment-grade ratings from two of S & P, Moodys or Fitch, the Subsidiary or master lessee if such property is owned by an Exchange Fee Titleholder owning any Unencumbered Property shall no longer be required to be a Subsidiary Guarantor unless such entity has outstanding recourse indebtedness.
 
A Subsidiary Guarantor shall be automatically released from its obligations under the Subsidiary Guaranty if (i) there is no Event of Default (or event which, upon expiration of an applicable cure period, will become an Event of Default), and (ii) Borrower delivers an updated Compliance Certificate to Administrative Agent demonstrating compliance with all financial covenants contained in 10.1 and this Agreement without the inclusion of the Unencumbered Property owned by such Subsidiary (or Exchange Fee Titleholder if the Subsidiary Guarantor is the master lessee) in the calculation of Borrowers compliance with any of the foregoing covenants pertaining to Unencumbered Properties, and representing and warranting that based on the information as of the end or the prior quarter, but without counting the Unencumbered Property owned by the Subsidiary Guarantor being released (or owned by the Exchange Fee Titleholder if the Subsidiary Guarantor being released is the master lessee) as an Unencumbered Property, Borrower will continue to comply with all of the financial covenants in this Agreement upon release of such Unencumbered Property and such Subsidiary Guarantor.  A Subsidiary that became a party to the Subsidiary Guaranty because it was master leasing a Property owned by an Exchange Fee Titleholder shall be released in accordance with Section 8.13(b) upon delivery of a joinder to the Subsidiary Guaranty by the Exchange Fee Titleholder once it becomes a Subsidiary of the Borrower, or an election by Borrower to cause such Property to cease to be an Unencumbered Property in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.  A Subsidiary that became a party to the Subsidiary Guaranty because it was an Exchange Depositor or a Subsidiary owning tenant in common interests that have not been sold with respect to an Exchange Property shall be released in accordance with Section 6.12 upon the earlier of the end of the marketing period described therein or 24 months, or an election by Borrower to cause such Property to cease to be an Unencumbered Property in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.  Subject to the foregoing, the Administrative Agent shall, from time to time, upon request from the Borrower, execute and deliver to the Borrower a written acknowledgement that a Subsidiary Guarantor has been released from its obligations under the Subsidiary Guaranty and the Lenders hereby authorize the Administrative Agent to deliver such acknowledgement.
 
Section 8.14.                         Investor Guaranties.
 
The Administrative Agent and the Lenders have agreed to accept from time to time, upon the request of Borrower, one or more Investor Guaranties.  No Investor Guarantor shall be a person with whom Administrative Agent or any Lender is prohibited by Applicable Law from doing business, and Borrower shall deliver such information as Administrative Agent may reasonably request to verify the foregoing.
 
Section 8.15.                         Notices.
 
Promptly notify the Administrative Agent and each Lender:
 
(a)                                 of the occurrence of any Default;
 
64





 
(b)                                 of any matter that has resulted in a Material Adverse Effect, including any of the following that has resulted in a Material Adverse Effect:  (i) breach or non-performance of, or any default under, a Contractual Obligation of the Borrower or any Subsidiary; (ii) any action, suit, dispute, litigation, investigation, proceeding or suspension involving the Borrower or any Subsidiary and any Governmental Authority (including, without limitation pursuant to anti-money laundering Laws); or (iii) the commencement of, or any material development in, any litigation or proceeding affecting the Borrower or any Subsidiary, including pursuant to any applicable Environmental Laws;
 
(c)                                  of the occurrence of any ERISA Event that would reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect; and
 
(d)                                 of any material change in accounting policies or financial reporting practices by the Borrower or any Subsidiary.
 
Each notice pursuant to this Section 8.15 shall be accompanied by a statement of a Responsible Officer of the Borrower setting forth details of the occurrence referred to therein and stating what action the Borrower has taken and proposes to take with respect thereto.  Each notice pursuant to Section 8.15(a) shall describe with particularity any and all provisions of this Agreement and any other Loan Document that have been breached.

(b)                                 Enforcement by Administrative Agent.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any other Loan Document, the authority to enforce rights and remedies hereunder and under the other Loan Documents against the Loan Parties or any of them shall be vested exclusively in, and all actions and proceedings at law in connection with such enforcement shall be instituted and maintained exclusively by, the Administrative Agent in accordance with Article XI. for the benefit of all the Lenders; provided that the foregoing shall not prohibit (i) the Administrative Agent from exercising on its own behalf the rights and remedies that inure to its benefit (solely in its capacity as Administrative Agent) hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, (ii) any Lender from exercising setoff rights in accordance with Section 13.3. (subject to the terms of Section 3.3.), or (iii) any Lender from filing proofs of claim or appearing and filing pleadings on its own behalf during the pendency of a proceeding relative to any Loan Party under any Debtor Relief Law; and provided, further, that if at any time there is no Person acting as Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, then (x) the Requisite Lenders shall have the rights otherwise ascribed to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Article XI. and (y) in addition to the matters set forth in clauses (ii), (iv) and (v) of the preceding proviso and subject to Section 3.3., any Lender may, with the consent of the Requisite Lenders, enforce any rights and remedies available to it and as authorized by the Requisite Lenders.
 
ARTICLE XII. THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT
 
Section 12.1.                         Appointment and Authorization.
 
Each Lender hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such action as contractual representative on such Lenders behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as are specifically delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof and thereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.  Not in limitation of the foregoing, each Lender authorizes and directs the Administrative Agent to enter into the Loan Documents for the benefit of the Lenders.  Each Lender hereby agrees that, except as otherwise set forth herein, any action taken by the Requisite Lenders in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement or the Loan Documents, and the exercise by the Requisite Lenders of the powers set forth herein or therein, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto, shall be authorized and binding upon all of the Lenders.  Nothing herein shall be construed to deem the Administrative Agent a trustee or fiduciary for any Lender or to impose on the Administrative Agent duties or obligations other than those expressly provided for herein.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the use of the terms Agent, Administrative Agent, agent and similar terms in the Loan Documents with reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations
 
76





 
arising under agency doctrine of any Laws.  Instead, use of such terms is merely a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between independent contracting parties.  The Administrative Agent shall deliver to each Lender, promptly upon receipt thereof by the Administrative Agent, copies of each of the financial statements, certificates, notices and other documents delivered to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Article IX. that the Borrower is not otherwise required to deliver directly to the Lenders.  The Administrative Agent will furnish to any Lender, upon the request of such Lender, a copy (or, where appropriate, an original) of any document, instrument, agreement, certificate or notice furnished to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other Affiliate of the Borrower, pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document not already delivered or otherwise made available to such Lender pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any such other Loan Document.  As to any matters not expressly provided for by the Loan Documents (including, without limitation, enforcement or collection of any of the Obligations), the Administrative Agent shall not be required to exercise any discretion or take any action, but shall be required to act or to refrain from acting (and shall be fully protected in so acting or refraining from acting) upon the instructions of the Requisite Lenders (or all of the Lenders if explicitly required under any other provision of this Agreement), and such instructions shall be binding upon all Lenders and all holders of any of the Obligations; provided, however, that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action which exposes the Administrative Agent to personal liability or which is contrary to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or Laws.  Not in limitation of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent may exercise any right or remedy it or the Lenders may have under any Loan Document upon the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default unless the Requisite Lenders have directed the Administrative Agent otherwise.  Without limiting the foregoing, no Lender shall have any right of action whatsoever against the Administrative Agent as a result of the Administrative Agent acting or refraining from acting under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents in accordance with the instructions of the Requisite Lenders, or where applicable, all the Lenders.
 
Section 12.2.                         Administrative Agent as Lender.
 
The Lender acting as Administrative Agent shall have the same rights and powers as a Lender under this Agreement and any other Loan Document, as the case may be, as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent; and the term Lender or Lenders shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated, include Wells Fargo in each case in its individual capacity.  Wells Fargo and its Affiliates may each accept deposits from, maintain deposits or credit balances for, invest in, lend money to, act as trustee under indentures of, serve as financial advisor to, and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other Affiliate thereof as if it were any other bank and without any duty to account therefor to Lenders.  Further, the Administrative Agent and any Affiliate may accept fees and other consideration from the Borrower for services in connection with this Agreement, or otherwise without having to account for the same to the Lenders.  The Lenders acknowledge that, pursuant to such activities, Wells Fargo or its Affiliates may receive information regarding the Borrower, other Loan Parties, other Subsidiaries and other Affiliates (including information that may be subject to confidentiality obligations in favor of such Person) and acknowledge that the Administrative Agent shall be under no obligation to provide such information to them.
 
Section 12.3.                         Approvals of Lenders.
 
All communications from the Administrative Agent to any Lender requesting such Lenders determination, consent or approval (a) shall be given in the form of a written notice to such Lender, (b) shall be accompanied by a description of the matter or issue as to which such determination, consent or approval is requested, or shall advise such Lender where information, if any, regarding such matter or issue may be
 
77





 
inspected, or shall otherwise describe the matter or issue to be resolved and (c) shall include, if reasonably requested by such Lender and to the extent not previously provided to such Lender, written materials provided to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower in respect of the matter or issue to be resolved.  Unless a Lender shall give written notice to the Administrative Agent that it specifically objects to the requested determination, consent or approval (together with a reasonable written explanation of the reasons behind such objection) within 10 Business Days (or such lesser or greater period as may be specifically required under the express terms of the Loan Documents) of receipt of such communication, such Lender shall be deemed to have conclusively approved of or consented to such.  The provisions of this Section shall not apply to any amendment, waiver or consent regarding any of the matters described in Section 13.6.(c).
 
Section 12.4.                         Notice of Events of Default.
 
The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of a Default or Event of Default unless the Administrative Agent has received notice from a Lender or the Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing with reasonable specificity such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a notice of default.  If any Lender (excluding the Lender which is also serving as the Administrative Agent) becomes aware of any Default or Event of Default, it shall promptly send to the Administrative Agent such a notice of default; provided, a Lenders failure to provide such a notice of default to the Administrative Agent shall not result in any liability of such Lender to any other party to any of the Loan Documents.  Further, if the Administrative Agent receives such a notice of default, the Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to the Lenders.
 
Section 12.5.                         Administrative Agents Reliance.
 
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement or any other Loan Documents, neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its Related Parties shall be liable for any action taken or not taken by it under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, except for its or their own gross negligence or willful misconduct in connection with its duties expressly set forth herein or therein as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final non-appealable judgment.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (including its own counsel or counsel for the Borrower or any other Loan Party), independent public accountants and other experts selected by it and shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by it in accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts.  Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its Related Parties:  (a) makes any warranty or representation to any Lender or any other Person, or shall be responsible to any Lender or any other Person for any statement, warranty or representation made or deemed made by the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other Person in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document; (b) shall have any duty to ascertain or to inquire as to the performance or observance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the satisfaction of any conditions precedent under this Agreement or any Loan Document on the part of the Borrower or other Persons, or to inspect the property, books or records of the Borrower or any other Person; (c) shall be responsible to any Lender for the due execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, any other instrument or document furnished pursuant thereto or any collateral covered thereby or the perfection or priority of any Lien in favor of the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders Parties in any such collateral; (d) shall have any liability in respect of any recitals, statements, certifications, representations or warranties contained in any of the Loan Documents or any other document, instrument, agreement, certificate or statement delivered in connection therewith; and (e) shall incur any liability under or in respect of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by acting upon any notice, consent, certificate or other
 
78





 
instrument or writing (which may be by telephone, telecopy or electronic mail) believed by it to be genuine and signed, sent or given by the proper party or parties.  The Administrative Agent may execute any of its duties under the Loan Documents by or through agents, employees or attorneys-in-fact and shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agent or attorney-in-fact that it selects in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such agent or attorney-in-fact as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final non-appealable judgment.
 
Section 12.6.                         Indemnification of Administrative Agent.
 
Each Lender agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so) pro rata in accordance with such Lenders respective Pro Rata Share (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought), from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of any kind or nature whatsoever which may at any time be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent but not as a Lender) in any way relating to or arising out of the Loan Documents, any transaction contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by the Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents (collectively, Indemnifiable Amounts); provided, however, that no Lender shall be liable for any portion of such Indemnifiable Amounts to the extent resulting from the Administrative Agents gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final, non-appealable judgment; provided, further, that no action taken in accordance with the directions of the Requisite Lenders (or all of the Lenders, if expressly required hereunder) shall be deemed to constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct for purposes of this Section.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Lender agrees to reimburse the Administrative Agent (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so) promptly upon demand for its Pro Rata Share (determined as of the time that the applicable reimbursement is sought) of any out of pocket expenses (including the reasonable fees and expenses of the counsel to the Administrative Agent) incurred by the Administrative Agent in connection with the preparation, negotiation, execution, administration, or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings, or otherwise) of, or legal advice with respect to the rights or responsibilities of the parties under, the Loan Documents, any suit or action brought by the Administrative Agent to enforce the terms of the Loan Documents and/or collect any Obligations, any lender liability suit or claim brought against the Administrative Agent and/or the Lenders, and any claim or suit brought against the Administrative Agent and/or the Lenders arising under any Environmental Laws.  Such out of pocket expenses (including reasonable counsel fees) shall be advanced by the Lenders on the request of the Administrative Agent notwithstanding any claim or assertion that the Administrative Agent is not entitled to indemnification hereunder upon receipt of an undertaking by the Administrative Agent that the Administrative Agent will reimburse the Lenders if it is actually and finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that the Administrative Agent is not so entitled to indemnification.  The agreements in this Section shall survive the payment of the Loans and all other Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.  If the Borrower shall reimburse the Administrative Agent for any Indemnifiable Amount following payment by any Lender to the Administrative Agent in respect of such Indemnifiable Amount pursuant to this Section, the Administrative Agent shall share such reimbursement on a ratable basis with each Lender making any such payment.
 
Section 12.7.                         Lender Credit Decision, Etc.
 
Each of the Lenders expressly acknowledges and agrees that neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its Related Parties has made any representations or warranties to such Lender and that no act by the Administrative Agent hereafter taken, including any review of the affairs of the Borrower, any other Loan
 
79





 
Party or any other Subsidiary or Affiliate, shall be deemed to constitute any such representation or warranty by the Administrative Agent to any Lender.  Each of the Lenders acknowledges that it has made its own credit and legal analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, any other Lender or counsel to the Administrative Agent, or any of their respective Related Parties, and based on the financial statements of the Borrower, the other Loan Parties, the other Subsidiaries and other Affiliates, and inquiries of such Persons, its independent due diligence of the business and affairs of the Borrower, the other Loan Parties, the other Subsidiaries and other Persons, its review of the Loan Documents, the legal opinions required to be delivered to it hereunder, the advice of its own counsel and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate.  Each of the Lenders also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, any other Lender or counsel to the Administrative Agent or any of their respective Related Parties, and based on such review, advice, documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under the Loan Documents.  The Administrative Agent shall not be required to keep itself informed as to the performance or observance by the Borrower or any other Loan Party of the Loan Documents or any other document referred to or provided for therein or to inspect the properties or books of, or make any other investigation of, the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other Subsidiary.  Except for notices, reports and other documents and information expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent shall have no duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, operations, property, financial and other condition or creditworthiness of the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other Affiliate thereof which may come into possession of the Administrative Agent or any of its Related Parties.  Each of the Lenders acknowledges that the Administrative Agents legal counsel in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is only acting as counsel to the Administrative Agent and is not acting as counsel to any Lender.
 
Section 12.8.                         Successor Administrative Agent.
 
The Administrative Agent may resign at any time as Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents by giving written notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower.  Upon any such resignation, the Requisite Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor Administrative Agent which appointment shall, provided no Default or Event of Default exists, be subject to the Borrowers approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed (except that the Borrower shall, in all events, be deemed to have approved each Lender and any of its Affiliates as a successor Administrative Agent).  If no successor Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence, and shall have accepted such appointment, within 30 days after the current Administrative Agents giving of notice of resignation, then the current Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which shall be a Lender, if any Lender shall be willing to serve, and otherwise shall be an Eligible Assignee (but in no event shall any such successor Administrative Agent be a Defaulting Lender or an Affiliate of a Defaulting Lender); provided that if the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that no Lender has accepted such appointment, then such resignation shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice and (1) the Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and (2) all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made to each Lender directly, until such time as a successor Administrative Agent has been appointed as provided for above in this Section; provided, further that such Lenders so acting directly shall be and be deemed to be protected by all indemnities and other provisions herein for the benefit and protection of the Administrative Agent as if each such Lender were itself the Administrative Agent.  Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor Administrative
 
80





 
Agent, such successor Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the current Administrative Agent, and the current Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under the Loan Documents arising after the effective date of such assignment. After any Administrative Agents resignation hereunder as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Article XII. shall continue to inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the Administrative Agent may assign its rights and duties under the Loan Documents to any of its Affiliates by giving the Borrower and each Lender prior written notice.
 
Section 12.9.                         Titled Agents.
 
Each of the Arrangers, the Syndication Agent and the Documentation Agent (each a Titled Agent) in each such respective capacity, assumes no responsibility or obligation hereunder, including, without limitation, for servicing, enforcement or collection of any of the Loans, nor any duties as an agent hereunder for the Lenders.  The titles given to the Titled Agents are solely honorific and imply no fiduciary responsibility on the part of the Titled Agents to the Administrative Agent, any Lender, the Borrower or any other Loan Party and the use of such titles does not impose on the Titled Agents any duties or obligations greater than those of any other Lender or entitle the Titled Agents to any rights other than those to which any other Lender is entitled.

Section 13.2.                         Expenses.
 
The Borrower agrees (a) to pay or reimburse the Administrative Agent for all of its reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with the preparation, negotiation and execution of, and any amendment, supplement or modification to, any of the Loan Documents (including due diligence expenses and reasonable travel expenses related to closing), and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel to the Administrative Agent and all costs and expenses of the Administrative Agent in connection with the use of IntraLinks, SyndTrak or other similar information transmission systems in connection with the Loan Document and the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel to the Administrative Agent relating to all such activities, (b) to pay or reimburse the Administrative Agent, and the Lenders for all their reasonable and documented costs and expenses incurred in connection with the enforcement or preservation of any rights under the Loan Documents, including and limited to the fees, charges and disbursements of one outside counsel for the Administrative Agent and the Lenders; provided, that in the event of a conflict between such outside counsel and the Administrative Agent or any Lender, the reasonable and documented fees, charges and disbursements of one additional outside counsel engaged in respect of such conflict shall be paid by the Borrower, (c) to pay, and indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative Agent, and the Lenders from, any and all recording and filing fees and any and all liabilities with respect to, or resulting from any failure to pay or delay in paying, documentary, stamp, excise and other similar taxes, if any, which may be payable or determined to be payable in connection with the execution and delivery by any Loan Party of any of the Loan Documents, or consummation of any amendment, supplement or modification of, or any waiver or consent under or in respect of, any Loan Document and (d) to the extent not already covered by any of the preceding subsections, to pay or reimburse the fees and disbursements of counsel to the Administrative Agent, and any Lender incurred in connection with the representation of the Administrative Agent or such Lender in any matter relating to or arising out of any bankruptcy or other proceeding of the type described in Sections 11.1.(e) or 11.1.(f), including, without limitation (i) any motion for relief from any stay or similar order, (ii) the negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of any document relating to the Obligations and (iii) the negotiation and preparation of any debtor in possession financing or any plan of reorganization of the Borrower or any other Loan Party, whether proposed by the Borrower, such Loan Party, the Lenders or any other Person, and whether such fees and expenses are incurred prior to, during or after the commencement of such proceeding or the confirmation or conclusion of any such proceeding.  If the Borrower shall fail to pay any amounts required to be paid by it pursuant to this Section, the Administrative Agent and/or the Lenders may pay such amounts on behalf of the Borrower and such amounts shall be deemed to be Obligations owing hereunder.
 
Section 13.3.                         Setoff.
 
Subject to Section 3.3. and in addition to any rights now or hereafter granted under Laws and not by way of limitation of any such rights, the Borrower hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent, each Lender, each Affiliate of the Administrative Agent, or any Lender, at any time or from time to time while an Event of Default exists, without notice to the Borrower or to any other Person, any such notice being hereby expressly waived, but in the case of a Lender, exercised in their sole discretion, to set off and to appropriate and to apply any and all deposits (general or special, including, but not limited to, indebtedness evidenced by certificates of deposit, whether matured or unmatured) and any other indebtedness at any time held or owing by the Administrative Agent, such Lender, any Affiliate of the Administrative Agent, or such Lender, to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower against and on account of any of the Obligations, irrespective of whether or not any or all of the Loans and all other Obligations have been declared to be, or have otherwise become, due and payable as permitted by Section 11.2., and although such Obligations
 
83

Section 13.5.                         Successors and Assigns.
 
(a)                                 Successors and Assigns Generally.  The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except neither the Borrower nor any other Loan Party may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and each Lender, and no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder except (i) to an Eligible Assignee in accordance with the provisions of the immediately following subsection (b), (ii) by way of participation in accordance with the provisions of the immediately following subsection (d) or (iii) by way of pledge or assignment of a security interest subject to the restrictions of the immediately following subsection (e) (and, subject to the last sentence of the immediately following subsection (b), any other attempted assignment or transfer by any party hereto shall be null and void).  Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants to the extent provided in the immediately following subsection (d) and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.
 
(b)                                 Assignments by Lenders.  Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it); provided that any such assignment shall be subject to the following conditions:
 
(i)                                     Minimum Amounts.
 
(A)                               in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of an assigning Lenders Commitment or in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of an assigning Term Loan Lenders Term Loans at the time owing to it, or in the case of an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund, no minimum amount need be assigned; and
 
(B)                               in any case not described in the immediately preceding subsection (A), the principal outstanding balance of the Term Loan subject to such assignment (in each case,
 
85





 
determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if Trade Date is specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade Date) shall not be less than $5,000,000 in the case of any assignment in respect of a Term Loan, unless each of the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Event of Default shall exist, the Borrower otherwise consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided, however, that if, after giving effect to such assignment, the amount of the Commitment held by such assigning Lender or the outstanding principal balance of the Loans of such assigning Lender, as applicable, would be less than $1,000,000 in the case of a Term Loan, then such assigning Lender shall assign the entire amount of its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it.
 
(ii)                                  Proportionate Amounts.  Each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Loan assigned.
 
(iii)                               Required Consents.  No consent shall be required for any assignment except to the extent required by clause (i)(B) of this subsection (b) and, in addition:
 
(A)                               the consent of the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required unless (x) a Default or Event of Default shall exist at the time of such assignment or (y) such assignment is to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund; provided that the Borrower shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment unless it shall object thereto by written notice to the Administrative Agent within 5 Business Days after having received notice thereof; and
 
(B)                               the consent of the Administrative Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required for assignments in respect of (x) a Commitment or any unfunded Term Loan Commitments if such assignment is to a Person that is not already a Lender with a Commitment, an Affiliate of such a Lender or an Approved Fund with respect to such a Lender or (y) a Term Loan to a Person who is not a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund.
 
(iv)                              Assignment and Acceptance; Notes.  The parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of $4,500 for each assignment (which fee the Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, elect to waive), and the assignee, if it is not a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire.  If requested by the transferor Lender or the assignee, upon the consummation of any assignment, the transferor Lender, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall make appropriate arrangements so that new Notes are issued to the assignee and such transferor Lender, as appropriate, provided that the existing Notes are surrendered to the Borrower in connection therewith.
 
(v)                                 No Assignment to Certain Persons.  No such assignment shall be made to (A) the Borrower or any of the Borrowers Affiliates or Subsidiaries or (B) to any Defaulting Lender or any of its Subsidiaries, or to any Person who, upon becoming a Lender hereunder, would constitute a Defaulting Lender or a Subsidiary thereof.
 
86





 
(vi)                              No Assignment to Natural Persons.  No such assignment shall be made to a natural Person (or a holding Company, investment vehicle or trust for, as owned and operated for the primary benefit of a natural Person.
 
(vii)                           Certain Additional Payments.  In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments to the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with the consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Loans previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent, and each other Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon), and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro rata share of all Loans in accordance with its Commitment Percentage.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under Laws without compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs.
 
Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to the immediately following subsection (c), from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 5.4., 13.2. and 13.9. with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment; provided, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no assignment by a Defaulting Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender having been a Defaulting Lender.  Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this paragraph shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with the immediately following subsection (d).
 
(c)                                  Register.  The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at the Principal Office a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts (and stated interest) of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the Register).  The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement.  The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
 
(d)                                 Participations.  Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, but with five (5) days prior notice (unless an Event of Default exists) to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, sell
 
87





 
participations to any Person (other than a natural Person, or a holding company, investment vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated for the primary benefit of, a natural Person, or the Borrower or any of the Borrowers Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a Participant) in all or a portion of such Lenders rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans owing to it); provided that (i) such Lenders obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement. The Administrative Agent shall have no responsibility for monitoring the notice requirement set forth above in this provision. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to (w) increase such Lenders Commitment, (x) extend the date fixed for the payment of principal on the Loans or portions thereof owing to such Lender, (y) reduce the rate at which interest is payable thereon or (z) release any Guarantor from its Obligations under the Guaranty except as contemplated by Section 8.13.(b), in each case, as applicable to that portion of such Lenders rights and/or obligations that are subject to the participation.  The Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.10., 5.1., 5.4. (subject to the requirements and limitations therein, including the requirements under Section 3.10.(g) (it being understood that the documentation required under Section 3.10.(g) shall be delivered to the participating Lender)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section; provided that such Participant (A) agrees to be subject to the provisions of Section 5.6. as if it were an assignee under subsection (b) of this Section; and (B) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 5.1. or 3.10., with respect to any participation, than its participating Lender would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Regulatory Change that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation.  Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at the Borrowers request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrower to effectuate the provisions of Section 5.6. with respect to any Participant.  To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 13.3. as though it were a Lender; provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 3.3. as though it were a Lender.  Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participants interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the Participant Register); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participants interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations.  The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.
 
(e)                                  Certain Pledges.  Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment
 
88





 
shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.
 
(f)                                   No Registration.  Each Lender agrees that, without the prior written consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, it will not make any assignment hereunder in any manner or under any circumstances that would require registration or qualification of, or filings in respect of, any Loan or Note under the Securities Act or any other securities laws of the United States of America or of any other jurisdiction.
 
(g)                                  USA Patriot Act Notice; Compliance.  In order for the Administrative Agent to comply with know your customer and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including without limitation, the Patriot Act, prior to any Lender that is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside of the United States of America becoming a party hereto, the Administrative Agent may request, and such Lender shall provide to the Administrative Agent, its name, address, tax identification number and/or such other identification information as shall be necessary for the Administrative Agent to comply with federal law.
 
Section 13.6.                         Amendments and Waivers.
 
(a)                                 Generally.  Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, (i) any consent or approval required or permitted by this Agreement or any other Loan Document to be given by the Lenders may be given, (ii) any term of this Agreement or of any other Loan Document may be amended, (iii) the performance or observance by the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other Subsidiary of any material terms of this Agreement or such other Loan Document may be waived, and (iv) the continuance of any Default or Event of Default may be waived (either generally or in a particular instance and either retroactively or prospectively) with, but only with, the written consent of the Requisite Lenders (or the Administrative Agent at the written direction of the Requisite Lenders), and, in the case of an amendment to any Loan Document, the written consent of each Loan Party which is party thereto.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section, the Fee Letter may only be amended, and the performance or observance by any Loan Party thereunder may only be waived, in a writing executed by the parties thereto.
 
(b)                                 Additional Lender Consents.  In addition to the foregoing requirements, no amendment, waiver or consent shall:
 
(i)                                     increase (or reinstate) the Commitments of a Lender or subject a Lender to any additional obligations without the written consent of such Lender;
 
(ii)                                  reduce the principal of, or interest that has accrued or the rates of interest that will be charged on the outstanding principal amount of, any Loans or other Obligations without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby; provided, however, only the written consent of the Requisite Lenders shall be required for (x) the waiver of interest payable at the Post-Default Rate, retraction of the imposition of interest at the Post-Default Rate and amendment of the definition of Post-Default Rate and (y) to amend any financial covenant hereunder (or any defined term used therein) even if the effect of such amendment would be to reduce the rate of interest on any Loan or to reduce any fee payable hereunder;
 
(iii)                               reduce the amount of any Fees payable to a Lender without the written consent of such Lender;
 
89





 
(iv)                              modify the definition of Term Loan Maturity Date, or except as expressly provided in (b)(ii) above otherwise postpone any date fixed for, or forgive, any payment of principal of, or interest on, any Term Loans or for the payment of Fees or any other Obligations owing to the Term Loan Lenders, in each case, without the written consent of each Term Loan Lender;
 
(v)                                 modify the definition of Pro Rata Share or amend or otherwise modify the provisions of Section 3.2. without the written consent of each Lender;
 
(vi)                              amend this Section or amend the definitions of the terms used in this Agreement or the other Loan Documents insofar as such definitions affect the substance of this Section without the written consent of each Lender;
 
(vii)                           modify the definition of the term Requisite Lenders or modify in any other manner the number or percentage of the Term Loan Lenders required to make any determinations or waive any rights hereunder or to modify any provision hereof without the written consent of each Term Loan Lender; or
 
(viii)                        release any Guarantor from its obligations under the Guaranty (except as contemplated by Section 8.13.(b) or any specific provision of the Loan Documents) without the written consent of each Lender.
 
(c)                                  Amendment of Administrative Agents Duties, Etc.  No amendment, waiver or consent unless in writing and signed by the Administrative Agent, in addition to the Lenders required hereinabove to take such action, shall affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Defaulting Lender shall have any right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent hereunder (and any amendment, waiver or consent which by its terms requires the consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender may be effected with the consent of the applicable Lenders other than Defaulting Lenders), except that (x) the Commitments of any Defaulting Lender may not be increased, reinstated or extended without the written consent of such Defaulting Lender and (y) any waiver, amendment or modification requiring the consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender that by its terms affects any Defaulting Lender more adversely than other affected Lenders shall require the written consent of such Defaulting Lender.  No waiver shall extend to or affect any obligation not expressly waived or impair any right consequent thereon and any amendment, waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose set forth therein.  No course of dealing or delay or omission on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender in exercising any right shall operate as a waiver thereof or otherwise be prejudicial thereto.  Any Event of Default occurring hereunder shall continue to exist until such time as such Event of Default is waived in writing in accordance with the terms of this Section, notwithstanding any attempted cure or other action by the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other Person subsequent to the occurrence of such Event of Default.  Except as otherwise explicitly provided for herein or in any other Loan Document, no notice to or demand upon the Borrower shall entitle the Borrower to other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.
 
(d)                                 Technical Amendments.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 13.6., if the Administrative Agent and the Borrower have jointly identified an ambiguity, omission, mistake or defect in any provision of this Agreement or an inconsistency between provisions of this Agreement, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall be permitted to amend or waive such provision or provisions to cure such ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect or inconsistency so long as to do so would not adversely
 
90





 
affect the interests of the Lenders.  Any such amendment shall become effective without any further action or consent of any of other party to this Agreement.
 
Section 13.7.                         Nonliability of Administrative Agent and Lenders.
 
The relationship between the Borrower, on the one hand, and the Lenders, and the Administrative Agent, on the other hand, shall be solely that of borrower and lender.  None of the Administrative Agent, or any Lender shall have any fiduciary responsibilities to the Borrower and no provision in this Agreement or in any of the other Loan Documents, and no course of dealing between or among any of the parties hereto, shall be deemed to create any fiduciary duty owing by the Administrative Agent, or any Lender to any Lender, the Borrower, any Subsidiary or any other Loan Party.  None of the Administrative Agent, or any Lender undertakes any responsibility to the Borrower to review or inform the Borrower of any matter in connection with any phase of the Borrowers business or operations.
 
Section 13.8.                         Confidentiality.
 
The Administrative Agent, and each Lender shall maintain the confidentiality of all Information (as defined below) but in any event may make disclosure:  (a) to its Affiliates and to its and its Affiliates other respective Related Parties (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential); (b) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section, to (i) any actual or proposed assignee, Participant or other transferee in connection with a potential transfer of any Commitment or participation therein as permitted hereunder, or (ii) any actual or prospective counterparty (or its advisors) to any swap or derivative transaction relating to the Borrower and its obligations; (c) as required or requested by any Governmental Authority or representative thereof or pursuant to legal process or in connection with any legal proceedings, or as otherwise required by Laws; (d) to the Administrative Agents or such Lenders independent auditors and other professional advisors (provided they shall be notified of the confidential nature of the information); (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies under any Loan Document or any action or proceeding relating to any Loan Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder; (f) to the extent such Information (i) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section or (ii) becomes available to the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Affiliate of the Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis from a source which is not known to be bound by any confidentiality obligation other than the Borrower or any Affiliate of the Borrower; (g) to the extent requested by, or required to be disclosed to, any regulatory or similar authority purporting to have jurisdiction over such Person or its Related Parties (including any self-regulatory authority, such as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners); (h) of deal terms and other information customarily reported to Thomson Reuters, other bank market data collectors and similar service providers to the lending industry and service providers to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in connection with the administration of the Loan Documents; (i) to any other party hereto; (j) on a confidential basis to the CUSIP Service Bureau or any similar agency in connection with the issuance and monitoring of CUSIP numbers with respect to the Loan Documents; and (k) with the consent of the Borrower.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrative Agent and each Lender may in writing disclose any such confidential information, without notice to the Borrower or any other Loan Party, to Governmental Authorities in connection with any regulatory examination of the Administrative Agent or such Lender not targeted at Borrower or any other Loan Party targeted at Borrower or any other Loan Party or in accordance with the regulatory compliance policy of the Administrative Agent or such Lender.  As used in this Section, the term Information means all information received from the Borrower, any other Loan Party, any other Subsidiary or Affiliate relating to any Loan Party or any of their respective businesses, other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by
 
91





 
the Borrower, any other Loan Party, any other Subsidiary or any Affiliate, provided that, in the case of any such information received from the Borrower, any other Loan Party, any other Subsidiary or any Affiliate after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential.  Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information.
 
Section 13.9.                         Indemnification.
 
(a)                                 The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent (and any sub-agent thereof), each Lender, and each Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an Indemnitee) against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses (including the reasonable and documented fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee), and shall indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnitee from all fees and time charges and disbursements for attorneys who may be employees of any Indemnitee, incurred by any Indemnitee or asserted against any Indemnitee by any third party or by the Borrower or any other Loan Party arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby, the performance by the parties hereto of their respective obligations hereunder or thereunder, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or, in the case of the Administrative Agent (and any sub-agent thereof) and its Related Parties only, the administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (including in respect of any matters addressed in Section 3.10), (ii) any Loan or the use or proposed use of the proceeds therefrom, (iii) any actual or alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials on or from any property owned or operated by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Environmental Liability related in any way to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iv) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory, whether brought by a third party or by the Borrower or any other Loan Party, and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto, IN ALL CASES, WHETHER OR NOT CAUSED BY OR ARISING, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, OUT OF THE COMPARATIVE, CONTRIBUTORY OR SOLE NEGLIGENCE OF THE INDEMNITEE; provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses (x) are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee, (y) result from a claim brought by the Borrower or any other Loan Party against an Indemnitee for breach in bad faith of such Indemnitees obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document, if the Borrower or such other Loan Party has obtained a final and nonappealable judgment in its favor on such claim as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction or (z) result from a claim not involving an act or omission of the Borrower and that is brought by an Indemnitee against another Indemnitee (other than against the Administrative Agent or the co-lead arrangers in their capacities as such).
 
(b)                                 If and to the extent that the obligations of the Borrower under this Section are unenforceable for any reason, the Borrower hereby agrees to make the maximum contribution to the payment and satisfaction of such obligations which is permissible under Laws.
 
(c)                                  The Borrowers obligations under this Section shall survive any termination of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and the payment in full in cash of the Obligations, and are in addition to, and not in substitution of, any of the other obligations set forth in this Agreement or any other Loan Document to which it is a party.
 
92





 
Section 13.10.                  Termination; Survival.
 
This Agreement shall terminate at such time as (a) all of the Commitments have been terminated, (b) none of the Lenders is obligated any longer under this Agreement to make any Loans and (c) all Obligations (other than obligations which survive as provided in the following sentence) have been paid and satisfied in full.  The indemnities to which the Administrative Agent and the Lenders are entitled under the provisions of Sections 3.10., 5.1., 5.4., 12.6., 13.2. and 13.9. and any other provision of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and the provisions of Section 13.4., shall continue in full force and effect and shall protect the Administrative Agent and the Lenders (i) notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement, or of the other Loan Documents, against events arising after such termination as well as before and (ii) at all times after any such party ceases to be a party to this Agreement with respect to all matters and events existing on or prior to the date such party ceased to be a party to this Agreement.
 
Section 13.11.                  Severability of Provisions.
 
If any provision of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents shall be determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, that provision shall be deemed severed from the Loan Documents, and the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall remain in full force as though the invalid, illegal, or unenforceable provision had never been part of the Loan Documents.
 
Section 13.12.                  GOVERNING LAW.
 
THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK APPLICABLE TO CONTRACTS EXECUTED, AND TO BE FULLY PERFORMED, IN SUCH STATE.

To facilitate execution, this Agreement and any amendments, waivers, consents or supplements may be executed in any number of counterparts as may be convenient or required (which may be effectively delivered by facsimile, in portable document format (PDF) or other similar electronic means).  It shall not be necessary that the signature of, or on behalf of, each party, or that the signature of all persons required to bind any party, appear on each counterpart.  All counterparts shall collectively constitute a single document.  It shall not be necessary in making proof of this document to produce or account for more than a single counterpart containing the respective signatures of, or on behalf of, each of the parties hereto.
 
Section 13.14.                  Obligations with Respect to Loan Parties and Subsidiaries.
 
The obligations of the Borrower to direct or prohibit the taking of certain actions by the other Loan Parties and Subsidiaries as specified herein shall be absolute and not subject to any defense the Borrower may have that the Borrower does not control such Loan Parties or Subsidiaries.
 
Section 13.15.                  Independence of Covenants.
 
All covenants hereunder shall be given in any jurisdiction independent effect so that if a particular action or condition is not permitted by any of such covenants, the fact that it would be permitted by an exception to, or be otherwise within the limitations of, another covenant shall not avoid the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default if such action is taken or condition exists.
 
93





 
Section 13.16.                  Limitation of Liability.
 
None of the Administrative Agent, any Lender, or any of their respective Related Parties shall have any liability with respect to, and the Borrower hereby waives, releases, and agrees not to sue any of them upon, any claim for any special, indirect, incidental, consequential or punitive damages suffered or incurred by the Borrower in connection with, arising out of, or in any way related to, this Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents.
 
Section 13.17.                  Entire Agreement.
 
This Agreement and the other Loan Documents embody the final, entire agreement among the parties hereto and supersede any and all prior commitments, agreements, representations, and understandings, whether written or oral, relating to the subject matter hereof and thereof and may not be contradicted or varied by evidence of prior, contemporaneous, or subsequent oral agreements or discussions of the parties hereto.  To the extent any term of this Agreement is inconsistent with a term of any other Loan Document to which the parties of this Agreement are party, the term of this Agreement shall control to the extent of such inconsistency.  There are no oral agreements among the parties hereto.
 
Section 13.18.                  Construction.
 
The Administrative Agent, the Borrower and each Lender acknowledge that each of them has had the benefit of legal counsel of its own choice and has been afforded an opportunity to review this Agreement and the other Loan Documents with its legal counsel and that this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be construed as if jointly drafted by the Administrative Agent, the Borrower and each Lender.
