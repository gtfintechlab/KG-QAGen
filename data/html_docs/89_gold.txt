(c)                                  Expiration Date.  Each Letter of Credit shall expire not later than the earlier of (i) the date one year after the date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or such longer period of time as may be agreed to by the applicable Issuing Bank) and (ii) the date that is five Business Days prior to the Revolving Credit Maturity Date; provided that any Letter of Credit may provide for the automatic extension thereof for any number of additional periods each of up to one year in duration (none of which, in any event, shall extend beyond the date referred to in clause (ii) of this paragraph (c) unless 103% of the then available face amount thereof is Cash collateralized or backstopped pursuant to arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Issuing Bank thereof).
 
(d)                                 Participations.  By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without any further action on the part of the applicable Issuing Bank or the Revolving Lenders, the applicable Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Revolving Lender, and each Revolving Lender hereby acquires from such Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Revolving Lenders Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit (calculated, in the case of Letters of Credit in an Alternative Currency, based on the Dollar Equivalent thereof).  In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Revolving Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank, in Dollars, such Lenders Applicable Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by such Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the Borrower on the date due as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section, or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the Borrower for any reason (calculated, in the case of Letters of Credit in an Alternative Currency, based on the Dollar Equivalent thereof).  Each Revolving Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or
 
62





 
the occurrence and continuance of a Default or Event of Default or reduction or termination of the Revolving Credit Commitments or the fact that, as a result of changes in currency exchange rates, such Revolving Lenders Revolving Credit Exposure at any time might exceed its Revolving Credit Commitment at such time (in which case Section 2.10(c) would apply), and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.
 
(e)                                  Reimbursement.  If the applicable Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent in Dollars an amount equal to such LC Disbursement not later than 1:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Business Day immediately following the date the Borrower receives notice under paragraph (g) of this Section of such LC Disbursement; provided that the Borrower may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Section 2.03 that such payment be financed with an ABR Revolving Borrowing in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so financed, the Borrowers obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting ABR Revolving Borrowing.  If the Borrower fails to make such payment when due, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Revolving Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the Borrower in respect thereof and such Revolving Lenders Applicable Percentage thereof.  Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Revolving Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent its Applicable Percentage of the payment then due from the Borrower, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.06 with respect to Loans made by such Revolving Lender (and Section 2.06 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Revolving Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the applicable Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Revolving Lenders.  Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment from the Borrower pursuant to this paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the applicable Issuing Bank or, to the extent that Revolving Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse such Issuing Bank, then to such Revolving Lenders and such Issuing Bank as their interests may appear.
 
(f)                                   Obligations Absolute.  The Borrowers obligation to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section 2.05 shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by the applicable Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit or (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the Borrowers obligations hereunder.  Neither the Administrative Agent, the Revolving Lenders nor any Issuing Bank, nor any of their Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of such Issuing Bank; provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse such Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered 

ed by a court of competent jurisdiction), such Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination.  In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the applicable Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.
 
(g)                                  Disbursement Procedures.  The applicable Issuing Bank shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit.  Such Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower by facsimile or email of such compliant demand for payment and whether such Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; provided that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such Issuing Bank and the Revolving Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement.
 
(h)                                 Interim Interest.  If an Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the Borrower reimburse such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to Revolving Loans that are ABR Loans; provided that if the Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section 2.05, then Section 2.12(c) shall apply.  Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Revolving Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section to reimburse such Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Revolving Lender to the extent of such payment.
 
(i)                                     Replacement of an Issuing Bank or Addition of New Issuing Banks.  An Issuing Bank may be replaced with the consent of the Administrative Agent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) at any time by written agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the successor Issuing Bank.  The Administrative Agent shall notify the Revolving Lenders of any such replacement of an Issuing Bank.  At the time any such replacement shall become effective, the Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.11(b)(ii).  From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of the replaced Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term Issuing Bank shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require.  After the replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit.  The Borrower may, at any time and from time to time with the consent of the Administrative Agent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and such Revolving Lender, designate one or more additional Revolving Lenders to act as an issuing bank under the terms of this Agreement.  Any Revolving Lender designated as an issuing bank pursuant to this paragraph (i) shall be deemed to be an Issuing Bank (in addition to being a Revolving Lender) in respect of Letters of Credit issued or to be issued by such Revolving Lender, and, with
 
64





 
respect to such Letters of Credit, such term shall thereafter apply to the other Issuing Banks and such Revolving Lender.
 
(j)                                    Cash Collateralization.
 
(i)                                     If any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, then on the Business Day that the Borrower receives notice from the Administrative Agent demanding the deposit of Cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph (j), upon such demand, the Borrower shall deposit, in an interest-bearing account with the Administrative Agent, in the name of the Administrative Agent and for the benefit of the Revolving Lenders and the Issuing Banks (the LC Collateral Account), an amount in Cash equal to 103% of the LC Exposure as of such date; provided that the obligation to deposit such Cash collateral shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the Borrower described in Section 7.01(f) or (g).
 
Any such deposit under clause (i) above shall be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the Secured Obligations in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (j).  The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account and the Borrower hereby grants the Administrative Agent a security interest in the LC Collateral Account.  Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account.  Moneys in such account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the applicable Issuing Bank for LC Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Borrower for the LC Exposure at such time.  If the Borrower is required to provide an amount of Cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount (together with all interest and other earnings with respect thereto, to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrower promptly but in no event later than three Business Days, after such Event of Default has been cured or waived.
 
Section 2.06.                          Funding of Borrowings.
 
(a)                                 Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 2:00 p.m., New York City time to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders in an amount equal to such Lenders respective Applicable Percentage.  The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to the Funding Account or as otherwise directed by the Borrower; provided that ABR Revolving Loans made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.05(e) shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent to the applicable Issuing Bank.
 
(b)                                 Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lenders share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount.  In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand (without duplication) such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to, but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the Overnight Rate or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Loans comprising such Borrowing at such time.  If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative
 
65





 
Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lenders Loan included in such Borrowing and the Borrowers obligation to repay the Administrative Agent such corresponding amount pursuant to this Section 2.06(b) shall cease.  If the Borrower pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, the amount so paid shall constitute a repayment of such Borrowing by such amount.  Nothing herein shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill its Commitment or to prejudice any rights which the Administrative Agent or the Borrower or any other Loan Party may have against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder.
 
Section 2.07.                          Type; Interest Elections.
 
(a)                                 Each Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a LIBO Rate Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a LIBO Rate Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section.  The Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders, based upon their Applicable Percentages and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing.
 
(b)                                 To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election either by delivering an irrevocable Interest Election Request in writing (by hand delivery, fax or other electronic transmission (including .pdf or .tif)) signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the Borrower was requesting a Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election.
 
(c)                                  Each written Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:
 
(i)                                     the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing);
 
(ii)                                  the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;
 
(iii)                               whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a LIBO Rate Borrowing; and
 
(iv)                              if the resulting Borrowing is a LIBO Rate Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term Interest Period.
 
If any such Interest Election Request requests a LIBO Rate Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one months duration.
 
(d)                                 Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each applicable Lender of the details thereof and of such Lenders portion of each resulting Borrowing.
 
66





 
(e)                                  If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a LIBO Rate Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be converted to a LIBO Rate Borrowing with an Interest Period of one month.  Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Borrower, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a LIBO Rate Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each LIBO Rate Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing, as applicable, at the end of the then-current Interest Period applicable thereto.
 
Section 2.08.                          Termination and Reduction of Commitments.
 
(a)                                 (i) The Term Commitments existing on the Closing Date shall automatically terminate (x) upon the making of the Term Loans on the Funding Date and (y) if not already so reduced, to $0 on the Funding Date upon the funding (if any) of Term Loans permitted to be made on such date and (ii) unless previously terminated, the Revolving Credit Commitments shall terminate on the Revolving Credit Maturity Date.
 
(b)                                 Upon delivering the notice required by Section 2.08(d), the Borrower may at any time terminate the Revolving Credit Commitments upon (i) the payment in full in Cash of all outstanding Revolving Loans, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon, (ii) the cancellation and return of all outstanding Letters of Credit (or alternatively, with respect to each such Letter of Credit, the furnishing to the Administrative Agent of a Cash deposit (or if reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the applicable Issuing Bank, a backup standby letter of credit) equal to 103% of the LC Exposure as of such date) and (iii) the payment in full of all accrued and unpaid fees and all reimbursable expenses and other non-contingent Obligations with respect to the Revolving Facility then due, together with accrued and unpaid interest (if any) thereon.
 
(c)                                  Upon delivering the notice required by Section 2.08(d), the Borrower may from time to time reduce the Revolving Credit Commitments; provided that (i) each reduction of the Revolving Credit Commitments shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of the Dollar Equivalent of $100,000 and not less than the Dollar Equivalent or $1,000,000 and (ii) the Borrower shall not reduce the Revolving Credit Commitments if, after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of the Revolving Loans in accordance with Section 2.09 or Section 2.10, the Aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure would exceed the Total Revolving Credit Commitment.
 
(d)                                 The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the Commitments under paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section 2.08 at least one Business Day prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date thereof.  Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Revolving Lenders of the contents thereof.  Each notice delivered by the Borrower pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable; provided that a notice of termination of the Revolving Credit Commitments delivered by the Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other transactions, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied.  Any termination or reduction of the Revolving Credit Commitments pursuant to this Section 2.08 shall be permanent.  Upon any reduction of the Revolving Credit Commitments, the Revolving Credit Commitment of each Revolving Lender shall be reduced by such Revolving Lenders Applicable Percentage of such reduction amount.

Section 2.09.                          Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt.
 
(a)                                 Commencing on June 30, 2019, the Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to repay the outstanding Term Loans to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Term Lender (i) on the last day of each March, June, September and December prior to the Term Loan Maturity Date (each such date being referred to as a Loan Installment Date), in each case in an amount equal to 0.25% of the original principal amount of such Term Loans on the Funding Date (as such payments may be reduced from time to time as a result of the application of prepayments in accordance with Section 2.10 and Section 9.05(g) or increased as a result of any increase in the amount of such Term Loans pursuant to Section 2.21(a) (which shall include, at the Borrowers election, such adjustments as are necessary in order to provide for the fungibility of such Additional Term Loans)), and (ii) on the Term Loan Maturity Date, the remainder of the principal amount of the Term Loans outstanding on such date, together in each case with accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount to be paid to but excluding the date of such payment.
 
(b)                                 The Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Revolving Loan on the Revolving Credit Maturity Date, and each such payment shall be made by the Borrower in the same currency as each outstanding Revolving Loan that is being repaid.  On the Revolving Credit Maturity Date, the Borrower shall or shall cause the beneficiary thereof to cancel and return all outstanding Letters of Credit (or alternatively, with respect to each such Letter of Credit, furnish to the Administrative Agent a Cash deposit (or if reasonably satisfactory to the relevant Issuing Bank, a backup standby letter of credit) equal to 100% of the LC Exposure as of such date) and make payment in full in Cash of all accrued and unpaid fees and all reimbursable expenses and other Obligations with respect to the Revolving Facility then due, together with accrued and unpaid interest (if any) thereon.
 
(c)                                  Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.
 
(d)                                 The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall record (i) the amount and currency of each Loan made hereunder, the Class and Type thereof and the Interest Period (if any) applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lenders share thereof.
 
(e)                                  The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph (c) or (d) of this Section 2.09 shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein (absent manifest error); provided that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any manifest error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; provided, further, that in the event of any inconsistency between the accounts maintained by the Administrative Agent pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section 2.09 and any Lenders records, the accounts of the Administrative Agent shall govern.
 
(f)                                   Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by a Promissory Note.  In such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a Promissory Note payable to such Lender and its registered assigns.  Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such
 
68





 
Promissory Note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 9.05) be represented by one or more Promissory Notes in such form payable to the payee named therein and its registered assigns.
 
Section 2.10.                          Prepayment of Loans.
 
(a)                                 Optional Prepayments.
 
(i)                                     Upon prior notice in accordance with paragraph (a)(iii) of this Section, the Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing of Term Loans in whole or in part without premium or penalty (but subject to Sections 2.11(e) and 2.15).  Each such prepayment shall be paid to the Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages.
 
(ii)                                  Upon prior notice in accordance with paragraph (a)(iii) of this Section 2.10, the Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing of Revolving Loans in whole or in part without premium or penalty (but subject to Section 2.15).  Prepayments made pursuant to this Section 2.10(a)(ii), first, shall be applied ratably to outstanding LC Disbursements and second, shall be applied ratably to the outstanding Revolving Loans, including with respect to any Incremental Revolving Facility, and in each case, shall be made by the Borrower in the same currency as the outstanding LC Disbursements and/or the outstanding Revolving Loans being prepaid.
 
(iii)                               The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent in writing by providing a Prepayment Notice with respect to (A) of any prepayment under this Section 2.10(a) in the case of prepayment of a LIBO Rate Borrowing, not later than 1:00 p.m. three Business Days before the date of prepayment or (B) in the case of prepayment of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 1:00 p.m. one Business Day before the date of prepayment.  Each Prepayment Notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date and the principal amount and currency of each Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid; provided that a Prepayment Notice delivered by the Borrower may state that such Prepayment Notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other transactions, in which case such Prepayment Notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied.  Promptly following receipt of any such Prepayment Notice relating to a Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall advise the relevant Lenders of the contents thereof.  Each partial prepayment of any Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of an advance of a Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section 2.02(c).  Each prepayment of Term Loans made pursuant to this Section 2.10(a) shall be applied against the remaining scheduled installments of principal due in respect of the Term Loans of such Class in the manner specified by the Borrower or, if not so specified on or prior to the date of such optional prepayment, in direct order of maturity.
 
(b)                                 Mandatory Prepayments.
 
(i)                                     No later than the fifth Business Day after the date on which the financial statements with respect to each Fiscal Year of the Borrower are required to be delivered pursuant to Section 5.01(b), commencing with the Fiscal Year ending on December 31, 2019,  the Borrower shall prepay the outstanding Term Loans in accordance 

) $20,000,000 in the aggregate in any Fiscal Year, the Borrower shall apply an amount equal to 100% of the Net Proceeds or Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds received with respect thereto in excess of such thresholds to prepay outstanding Term Loans; provided that if, on the date any such Net Proceeds or Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds are received, the First Lien Leverage Ratio (as determined on a Pro Forma Basis as of the last day of the most recently ended Test Period (but excluding the receipt of such Net Proceeds or Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds, as applicable)) shall be (A) less than 4.00:1.00 but greater than or equal to 3.50:1.00, the percentage of Net Proceeds or Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds, as applicable, required to prepay the outstanding Term Loans shall be reduced to 50.0% and (B) less than 3.50:1.00, no such prepayment shall be required; provided that if prior to the date any such
 
70





 
prepayment is required to be made, the Borrower notifies the Administrative Agent of its intention to reinvest such Net Proceeds or Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds in the business of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries (other than working capital, except for short term capital assets and except to the extent acquired in connection with an acquisition or another Investment in another Person permitted under this Agreement), then so long as no Event of Default then exists, the Borrower shall not be required to make a mandatory prepayment under this clause (ii) in respect of such Net Proceeds or Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds to the extent such Net Proceeds or Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds are so reinvested within 450 days following receipt thereof, or if the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries has entered into a binding contract to so reinvest such Net Proceeds or Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds during such 450-day period and such Net Proceeds or Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds are so reinvested within 180 days after the expiration of such 4

inst it if such Net Proceeds or Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds had been repatriated to the U.S. such Foreign Subsidiary by means of a distribution or dividend or (y) such Excess Cash Flow, Net Proceeds or Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds are applied to the repayment of Indebtedness of a Foreign Subsidiary; provided, further, that to the extent that the repatriation by means of a distribution or dividend of any Net Proceeds, Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow from such Foreign Subsidiary would no longer have a material and adverse tax consequence, an amount equal to the Net Proceeds, Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow, as applicable, not previously applied pursuant to preceding clauses (x) and (y), shall be promptly applied to the repayment of the Term Loans pursuant to this Section 2.10(b) as otherwise required above (without regard to this clause (iv)).
 
(v)                                 Each Term Lender may elect, by notice to the Administrative Agent at or prior to the time and in the manner specified by the Administrative Agent, prior to any prepayment of Term Loans required to be made by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.10(b), to decline all (but not a portion) of its Applicable Percentage of such prepayment (such declined amounts, the Declined Proceeds) in which case such Declined Proceeds may be retained by the Borrower and shall be added to the calculation of the Available Amount; provided, further, that, for the avoidance of doubt, no Lender may reject any prepayment made under Section 2.10(b)(iii) above to the extent constituting Refinancing Indebtedness incurred to refinance all or a portion of the Term Loans pursuant to Section 6.01(o), Incremental Loans incurred to refinance all or a portion of the Term Loans pursuant to Section 2.21(a)(y) or Replacement Term Loans incurred to refinance Term Loans in accordance with the requirements of Section 9.02(c).  If a Lender fails to deliver a notice of election declining receipt of its Applicable Percentage of such mandatory
 
72

(b)                                 The Borrower agrees to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Lender (subject to Section 2.20) a participation fee with respect to their participations in Letters of Credit, which for Letters of Credit denominated in Dollars or an Alternative Currency shall accrue at the same Applicable Rate used to determine the interest rate applicable to LIBO Rate Revolving Loans, in each case, on the daily face amount of such Lenders Applicable Percentage in respect of Letters of Credit (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements), during the period from and including the Closing Date through the later of the date on which such Revolving Lenders Revolving Credit Commitment terminates and the date on which such Revolving Lender ceases to have any LC Exposure in respect of Letters of Credit and (ii) to each Issuing Bank, for its own account, a fronting fee, in respect of each Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank for the period from the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit to the

(e)                                  In the event that, on or prior to the date that is six months after the Closing Date, the Borrower (x) prepay, repay, refinance or replace any Term Loans in connection with a Repricing Transaction (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any prepayment made pursuant to Section 2.10(b)(iii) that constitutes a Repricing Transaction), or (y) effect any amendment, modification, waiver or consent under this Agreement resulting in a Repricing Transaction, the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for the ratable account of each of the applicable Lenders, (I) in the case of clause (x) above, a premium of 1.00% of the aggregate principal amount of the Term Loans so prepaid, repaid, refinanced or replaced and (II) in the case of clause (y), a fee equal to 1.00% of the aggregate principal amount of the Term Loans that are the subject of such Repricing Transaction outstanding immediately prior to such amendment, modification, waiver or consent.  If, on or prior to the date that is six months after the Closing Date, all or any portion of the Term Loans held by any Lender are prepaid, repaid, refinanced or replaced pursuant to Section 2.18 as a result of, or in connection with, such Lender not agreeing or otherwise consenting to any waiver, consent, modification or amendment referred to in clause (y) above (or otherwise in connection with a Repricing Transaction), such prepayment, repayment, refinancing or replacement will be made at 101% of the principal amount so prepaid, repaid, refinanced or replaced.  All such amounts shall be due and payable on the date of effectiveness of such Repricing Transaction.
 
(f)                                   The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Term Lender on a pro rata basis in accordance with such Lenders Term Commitments, a ticking fee payable in Dollars which shall accrue on the daily outstanding amount of such Lenders Term Commitments at a rate per annum equal to 1.50% during the period from and including the Closing Date until the date on which the Term Loans are funded, with such fee payable on the date such Term Loans are funded. All ticking fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).

(b)                                 The Term Loans and Revolving Loans comprising each LIBO Rate Borrowing shall bear interest at the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the

 any Loan (other than a prepayment of an ABR Revolving Loan prior to the termination of the relevant revolving Commitments), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the event of any conversion of any LIBO Rate Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion.
 
(e)                                  All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, except that interest computed by reference to the Alternate Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).  The applicable Alternate Base Rate or Adjusted LIBO Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion is paid; provided that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall bear interest for one day.

(i)                                     the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the applicable currency and such Interest Period; or
 
(ii)                                  the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the applicable currency and such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their Loans included in such Borrowing for the applicable currency and such Interest Period (any Alternative Currency affected by the circumstances described in Section 2.13(a)(i) or (ii) is referred to as an Affected Alternative Currency);
 
then the Administrative Agent shall promptly give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders by facsimile or email as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, which the Administrative Agent agrees promptly to do, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any such Borrowing as, a LIBO Rate Borrowing shall be ineffective and such Borrowing shall be continued as, or converted to, an ABR Borrowing (in the case of any conversion to an ABR Borrowing, on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereof), and (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a LIBO Rate Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing.
 
Section 2.14.                          Increased Costs.

(ii)                                  impose on any Len

f any obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by Requirements of Law.  If any Requirements of Law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable withholding agent) require the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a Loan Party, then the applicable withholding agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with the Requirements of Law; provided that if an applicable withholding agent shall be required to deduct or withhold any Indemnified Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after making all such required deductions or withholdings (including deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent (acting for its own account), any Lender or any Issuing Bank (as applicable) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions or withholding been made, (ii) such withholding agent shall make such deductions or withholdings and (iii) such withholding agent shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with Requirements of Law.  If at any time a Loan Party is required by Requirements of Law to make any deduction or withholding from any sum payable hereunder, such Loan Party shall promptly notify the relevant Lender or Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent upon becoming aware of the same.  In addition, each Lender or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, shall promptly notify a Loan Party upon becoming aware of any circumstances as a result of which a Loan Party is or would be required to make any deduction or withholding from any sum payable hereunder.
 
(b)                                 In addition, the Loan Parties shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with Requirements of Law.
 
(c)                                  Each Loan Party shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender and each Issuing Bank within thirty (30) days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes paid by the Administrative Agent or such Lender or Issuing Bank, as applicable (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) and any penalties (other than any penalties or interest attributable to the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Administrative Agent, such Lender or Issuing Bank (in each case, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final, non-appealable judgment; provided, the Administrative Agents or a Lenders or Issuing Banks failure to furnish notice of a claim within six months from the date on which the Administrative Agent or such Lender or Issuing Bank has received notice from the relevant Governmental Authority that amounts were being asserted against the

Administrative Agent or such Lender or Issuing Bank, as applicable, shall be deemed to be gross negligence)), and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority; provided that if the Loan Party reasonably believes that such Taxes were not correctly or legally asserted, the Administrative Agent, Lender or Issuing Bank, as applicable, will use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Loan Party to obtain a refund of such Taxes (which shall be repaid to the Loan Party in accordance with Section 2.16(g))) so long as such efforts would not, in the sole determination of the Administrative Agent or such Lender or Issuing Bank, result in any additional costs or expenses not reimbursed by the Loan Party or be otherwise materially disadvantageous to it. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender, an Issuing Bank (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or an Issuing Bank, and (ii) certifying that such Lender or Issuing Bank is generally charging the relevant amounts to similarly situated borrowers, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
 
(d)                                 Each Lender shall severally indemnify, within thirty (30) days after demand therefor, (i) the Administrative Agent for any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Loan Parties to do so), (ii) the Administrative Agent and any Loan Party for any Taxes attributable to such Lenders failure to comply with the provisions of Section 9.05(c) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) the Administrative Agent and any Loan Party for any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent or such Loan Party in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent or such Loan Party shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent and the Loan Parties to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent or such Loan Party to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent or such Loan Party under this paragraph (d).
 
(e)                                  As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes by a Loan Party to a Governmental Authority, such Loan Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

(ii)                                  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
 
(A)                               any Lender that is a U.S. person as defined under Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code shall deliver to the Borrower and Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed copies of IRS Form W-9 (or successor form) certifying that such Lender is not subject to U.S. federal backup withholding tax;

(C)                               any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or Administrative Agent), executed copies of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower or Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and
 
(D)                               if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lenders obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (D), FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
 
(iii)                               Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall (to the extent it is legally entitled to do so) promptly deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent renewals, amendments or additional or successor forms, properly completed and duly executed by such Lender, together with any other certificate or statement of exemption required in order to confirm or establish such Lenders status or that such Lender is entitled to an exemption from or reduction in applicable Tax.  If as a result of any Change in Law, regulation or treaty, or in any official application or interpretation thereof applicable to the payments made by or on behalf of any Loan Party or by the Administrative Agent under any Loan Document or any change in an income tax treaty applicable to any Lender, any Lender is unable to submit to the Borrower or the Administrative Agent any form or certificate that such Lender is obligated to submit pursuant to Section 2.16(f)(ii) or such Lender is required to withdraw or cancel any such form or certificate previously submitted or any such form or certificate otherwise becomes ineffective or inaccurate, such Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower and Administrative Agent of such fact and the Lender shall not be obligated to provide any such form or certificate and will be entitled to withdraw or cancel any affected form or certificate, as applicable.
 
(iv)                              Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to deliver to the Loan Parties and to any successor Administrative Agent any documentation provided by such Lender to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 2.16(f).
 
(g)                                  If the Administrative Agent, an Issuing Bank or a Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Indemnified Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by a Loan Party or with respect to which such Loan Party has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.16, it shall pay over such refund to such Loan Party (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such Loan Party under this Section 2.16 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent, such Lender or Issuing Bank (including any Taxes imposed with respect to such refund) as is
 
81





 
determined by the Administrative Agent, such Lender or Issuing Bank in good faith in its reasonable discretion, and without interest (other than any net after-Tax interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); provided that such Loan Party, upon the request of the Administrative Agent, such Lender or Issuing Bank, agrees to repay the amount paid over to such Loan Party (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent, such Lender or Issuing Bank in the event the Administrative Agent, such Lender or Issuing Bank is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (g), in no event will the Administrative Agent, a Lender or an Issuing Bank be required to pay any amount to a Loan Party pursuant to this paragraph (g) to the extent that the payment of which would place the Administrative Agent, Lender or Issuing Bank in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the Administrative Agent, Lender or Issuing Bank would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid.  This Section shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to such Loan Party or any other Person or to arrange its affairs in any particular manner.
 
(h)                                 Survival.  Each partys obligations under this Section 2.16 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document.
 
Section 2.17.                          Payments Generally; Allocation of Proceeds; Sharing of Set-offs.
 
(a)                                 The Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by them hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Sections 2.14, 2.15 or 2.16, or otherwise) in immediately available funds, without set-off (except as otherwise provided in Section 2.16) or counterclaim and, unless otherwise specified, prior to 2:00 p.m. on the date when due.  Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon.  All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent to the applicable account designated to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent, except payments to be made directly to the applicable Issuing Bank as expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.14, 2.15 or 2.16 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto.  The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof.  Except as otherwise provided herein (including in Section 2.20), each Borrowing, each payment or prepayment of principal of any Borrowing, each payment of interest on the Loans of a given Class and each conversion of any Borrowing to or continuation of any Borrowing as a Borrowing of any Type (and of the same Class) shall be allocated pro rata among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages.  Each Lender agrees that in computing such Lenders portion of any Borrowing to be made hereunder, the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion, round each Lenders percentage of such Borrowing to the next higher or lower whole Dollar amount.  All payments hereunder shall be made in Dollars.  Any payment required to be made by the Administrative Agent hereunder shall be deemed to have been made by the time required if the Administrative Agent shall, at or before such time, have taken the necessary steps to make such payment in accordance with the regulations or operating procedures of the clearing or settlement system used by the Administrative Agent to make such payment.
 
82





 
(b)                                 All proceeds of Collateral received by the Administrative Agent after an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and all or any portion of the Loans shall have been accelerated hereunder pursuant to Section 7.01, shall, upon election by the Administrative Agent or at the direction of the Required Lenders, be applied, first, on a pro rata basis, to pay any fees, indemnities or expense reimbursements then due to the Administrative Agent or any Issuing Bank from the Borrower constituting Obligations, second, on a pro rata basis, to pay any fees, indemnities or expense reimbursements then due to the Lenders from the Borrower constituting Obligations, third, to pay interest due and payable in respect of any Loans, on a pro rata basis, fourth, to prepay principal on the Loans and pay unreimbursed LC Disbursements, to pay all Banking Services Obligations that constitute Secured Obligations and to pay all Secured Hedging Obligations, on a pro rata basis among the Secured Parties, fifth, to pay an amount to the Administrative Agent equal to 103% of the LC Exposure on such date, to be held in the LC Collateral Account as Cash collateral for such Obligations, on a pro rata basis, sixth, to the payment of any other Secured Obligation (other than contingent indemnification obligations for which no claim has yet been made) due to the Administrative Agent or any Lender on a pro rata basis and seventh, to the Borrower or as the Borrower shall direct.
 
(c)                                  If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements of any Class resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements of such Class and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender with Loans of such Class, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for Cash at face value) participations in the Loans and sub-participations in LC Disbursements of other Lenders of such Class at such time outstanding to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders of such Class ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal 

shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or (y) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any permitted assignee or participant, including any payments made or deemed made in connection with Sections 2.21, 2.22 and 9.02(c).  The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agree, to the extent they may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.
 
(d)                                 Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or any Issuing Bank hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the applicable Issuing Bank the amount due.  In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the applicable Issuing Bank severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Overnight Rate.
 
83





 
(e)                                  If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.06(b), Section 2.17(c) or the last paragraph of Article 8, then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lenders obligations under such Sections or paragraphs, as applicable, until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.
 
Section 2.18.                          Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.
 
(a)                                 If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14 or such Lender determines it can no longer make or maintain LIBO Rate Loans pursuant to Section 2.19, or if any Loan Party is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or its participation in any Letter of Credit affected by such event, or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or Affiliates, if, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, such designat

 to such Lender in any material respect.  The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
 
(b)                                 If (i) any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14 or such Lender determines it can no longer make or maintain LIBO Rate Loans pursuant to Section 2.19, (ii) any Loan Party is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, (iii) any Lender is a Defaulting Lender or (iv) in connection with any proposed amendment, waiver or consent requiring the consent of each Lender or each Lender directly affected thereby with respect to which Required Lender consent has been obtained, any Lender is a non-consenting Lender (each such Lender, a Non-Consenting Lender), then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, (x) terminate the applicable Commitments and/or Additional Commitments of such Lender and repay all Obligations of the Borrower owing to such Lender relating to the Loans and participations held by such Lender as of such termination date under one or more Credit Facilities or Additional Credit Facilities as the Borrower may elect on a non-pro rata basis or (y) replace such Lender by requiring such Lender to assign and delegate (and such Lender shall be obligated to assign and delegate), without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.05), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an Eligible Assignee that shall assume such obligations (which Eligible Assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that (i) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal amount of its Loans and, if applicable, participations in LC Disbursements, in each case of suc

efaulting Lender, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder with respect to such Class of Loans, Commitments and/or Additional Commitments, (ii) in the case of any assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.14 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.16, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments and (iii) such assignment does not conflict with applicable law.  A Lender (other than a Defaulting Lender) shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation, and the Borrower may not repay the Obligations of such Lender or terminate its Commitments or Additional Commitments, if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower
 
84





 
to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.  Each Lender agrees that if it is replaced pursuant to this Section 2.18, it shall (x) execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption to evidence such sale and purchase and shall deliver to the Administrative Agent any Promissory Note (if the assigning Lenders Loans are evidenced by Promissory Notes) subject to such Assignment and Assumption; provided that the failure of any Lender replaced pursuant to this Section 2.18 to execute an Assignment and Assumption or deliver such Promissory Notes shall not render such sale and purchase (and the corresponding assignment) invalid and such assignment shall be recorded in the Register and the Promissory Notes shall be deemed cancelled and (y) consent to such proposed amendment, waiver or consent prior to signing such Assignment and Assumption.  Each Lender hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent (such appointment being coupled with an interest) as such Lenders attorney-in-fact, with full authority in the place and stead of such Lender and in the name of such Lender, from time to time in the Administrative Agents discretion, with prior written notice to such Lender, to take any action and to execute any such Assignment and Assumption or other instrument that the Administrative Agent may deem reasonably necessary to carry out the provisions of this clause (b).  To the extent a Lender is replaced pursuant to Section 2.18(b)(iv) in connection with a Repricing Transaction requiring payment of a fee pursuant to Section 2.11(e), the Borrower shall pay to each Lender being replaced the fee set forth in Section 2.11(e).
 
Section 2.19.                          Illegality.  If any Lender reasonably determines that any Change in Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted after the Closing Date that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its applicable lending office to make or maintain any LIBO Rate Loans then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, any obligations of such Lender to make or continue LIBO Rate Loans or to convert ABR Borrowings to LIBO Rate Borrowings shall be suspended until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist.  Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower shall upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), either convert all LIBO Rate Borrowings of such Lender to ABR Borrowings either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such LIBO Rate Borrowings to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Loans.  Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.  Each Lender agrees to designate a different lending office if such designation will avoid the need for such notice and will not, in the determination of such Lender, otherwise be materially disadvantageous to it.
 
Section 2.20.                          Defaulting Lenders.  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender:
 
(a)                                 Fees shall cease to accrue on the unfunded portion of the Revolving Credit Commitment of such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.11(a) and, subject to clause (d)(iv) below, on the participation of such Defaulting Lender in Letters of Credit pursuant to Section 2.11(b).
 
(b)                                 The Commitments and the LC Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether all Lenders, all affected Lenders, or the Required Lenders or Required Revolving Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment or waiver pursuant to Section 9.02); provided that any waiver, amendment or modification requiring the consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender which affects such Defaulting Lender disproportionately and adversely relative to other affected Lenders shall require the consent of such Defaulting Lender.
 
85





 
(c)                                  Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of a Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Section 2.10, Section 2.14, Section 2.15, Section 2.16, Section 2.17, Article 7, Section 9.06 or otherwise, and including any amounts made available to the Administrative Agent by that Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 9.09), shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent and, where relevant, the Borrower as follows:  first, to the payment of any amounts owing by that Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder; second, to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by that Defaulting Lender to any applicable Issuing Banks hereunder; third, if so reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent or reasonably requested by the applicable Issuing Bank, to be held as Cash collateral for future funding obligations of that Defaulting Lender of any participation in any Letter of Credit; fourth, as the Borrower may request (so long as no Default or Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which that Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent; fifth, if so determined by the Administrative Agent or the Borrower, to be held in a deposit account and released in order to satisfy obligations of that Defaulting Lender to fund Loans under this Agreement; sixth, to the payment of any amounts owing to the non-Defaulting Lenders and the Issuing Banks as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any non-Defaulting Lender or any Issuing Bank against that Defaulting Lender as a result of that Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement; seventh, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against that Defaulting Lender as a result of that Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and eighth, to that Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans or LC Exposure in respect of which that Defaulting 

) the sum of all non-Defaulting Lenders Revolving Credit Exposures does not exceed the total of all non-Defaulting Revolving Lenders Revolving Credit Commitments and (y) such reallocation does not cause the aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure of any non-Defaulting Lender to exceed such non-Defaulting Lenders Revolving Credit Commitments; provided, that, subject to Section 9.22, no reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such non-Defaulting Lenders increased exposure following such reallocation;
 
(ii)                                  if the reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrower shall, without prejudice to any other right or remedy available to it hereunder or under law, within two Business Days following notice by the Administrative Agent, Cash collateralize 100% of such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to paragraph (i) above and any Cash collateral provided by the Defaulting Lender or pursuant to
 
86





 
Section 2.20(c) above) or make other arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and to the applicable Issuing Bank with respect to such LC Exposure.  Cash collateral (or the appropriate portion thereof) provided to reduce LC Exposure or other obligations shall be released promptly following (A) the elimination of the applicable LC Exposure or other obligations giving rise thereto (including by the termination of Defaulting Lender status of the applicable Lender (or, as appropriate, its assignee following compliance with Section 2.18)) or (B) the Administrative Agents good faith determination that there exists excess Cash collateral (including any subsequent reallocation of LC Exposure among non-Defaulting Lenders described in clause (i) above);
 
(iii)                               if the LC Exposure of the non-Defaulting Lenders are reallocated pursuant to this Section 2.20(d), then the fees payable to the Revolving Lenders pursuant to Sections 2.11(a) and (b), as the case may be, shall be adjusted in accordance with such non-Defaulting Lenders Applicable Percentages; and
 
(iv)                              if any Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure is not Cash collateralized, prepaid or reallocated pursuant to this Section 2.20(d), then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of the applicable Issuing Bank or any Revolving Lender hereunder, all letter of credit fees payable under Section 2.11(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure shall be payable to the applicable Issuing Bank until such Defaulting Lenders LC Exposure is Cash collateralized.
 
(e)                                  So long as any Revolving Lender is Defaulting Lender, no Issuing Bank shall be required to issue, extend, create, incur, amend or increase any Letter of Credit unless it is reasonably satisfied that the related exposure will be 100% covered by the Revolving Credit Commitments of the non-Defaulting Lenders, Cash collateral provided pursuant to Section 2.20(c) and/or Cash collateral will be provided by the Borrower in accordance with Section 2.20(d), and participating interests in any such newly issued, extended or created Letter of Credit shall be allocated among non-Defaulting Revolving Lenders in a manner consistent with Section 2.20(d)(i) (and Defaulting Lenders shall not participate therein).
 
(f)                                   In the event that the Administrative Agent, the Borrower and the Issuing Banks each agree that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then the Applicable Percentage of LC Exposure of the Revolving Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lenders Revolving Credit Commitment and on such date such Revolving Lender shall purchase at par such of the Revolving Loans of the other Revolving Lenders or participations in Revolving Loans as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Revolving Lender to hold such Revolving Loans or participations in accordance with its Applicable Percentage; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while that Revolving Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lenders having been a Defaulting Lender.
 
Section 2.21.                          Incremental Credit Extensions.
 
(a)                                 The Borrower may, at any time, on one or more occasions deliver a written request to Administrative Agent to (i) add one or more new tranches of term facilities hereunder and/or increase the principal amount of the Term Loans or any Additional Term Loans by requesting new term loans commitments to be added to such Loans (any such new tranche or increase, an Incremental Term Facility and any loans made pursuant to an Incremental Term Facility, Incremental Term Loans) and/or (ii) add one or more new revolving credit facilities and/or

(ii)                                  except as separately agreed from time to time between the Borrower and any Lender, no Lender shall be obligated to provide all or any portion of any Incremental Commitment and the determination to provide such commitment shall be within the sole and absolute discretion of such Lender,
 
(iii)                               the creation or provision of any Incremental Facility or Incremental Loan shall not require the approval of any existing Lender other than any existing Lender providing all or part of any Incremental Commitment,
 
(iv)                              the material terms of each Incremental Revolving Facility will be substantially identical to those applicable to the Revolving Facility or Additional Revolving Facility being increased, as applicable, or otherwise reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent (other than with respect to margin, pricing, maturity, fees or any terms which are applicable only after the then-existing maturity date with respect to the Revolving Facility or Additional Revolving Facility, as applicable, subject, solely as to administrative matters, to the consent of the Administrative Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and other than as set forth under clause (v) below) and each Incremental Revolving Facility will mature no earlier than the then-existing maturity date applicable to the Revolving Facility or Additional Revolving Facility, as applicable, and will require no scheduled amortization or mandatory commitment reductions prior to such maturity date,
 
(v)                                 the interest rate and amortization schedule (subject to clause (vi) below) applicable to any Incremental Facility or Incremental Loans will be determined by the Borrower and the lenders providing such Incremental Term Facility or Incremental Term Loans; provided that, in the case of Incremental Term Loans or Incremental Term Facilities denominated in U.S. dollars that are pari passu in right of payment and with respect to security with the Initial Term Loans and incurred under the Incremental Incurrence Amount (other than through the reall

(xiv)                       such Incremental Facilities shall be on terms and pursuant to documentation to be determined; provided that, to the extent such terms and documentation are not consistent with the this Agreement (except to the extent permitted in clauses (i) through (xii) above), the terms and conditions of any such Incremental Facility shall be as agreed between the Borrower and the lenders providing any such Incremental Facility.
 
(b)                                 Incremental Commitments may be provided by any existing Lender, or by any other lender (any such other lender being called an Additional Lender); provided that the Administrative Agent (and the Issuing Bank, in the case of an Incremental Revolving Facility) shall have consented (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld) to such Additional Lenders providing such Incremental Commitments if such consent would be required under Section 9.05(b) for an assignment of Loans to such Additional Lender; provided, further, that any such Additional Lender that is an Affiliated Lender shall be subject to the provisions of Section 9.05(g), mutatis mutandis, to the same extent as if such Incremental Commitments and related Obligations had been obtained by such Lender by way of assignment.
 
(c)                                  Each Lender or Additional Lender providing a portion of the Incremental Commitments shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower all such documentation (including an amendment to this Agreement or any other Loan Document) as may be reasonably required by the Administrative Agent to evidence and effectuate such Incremental Commitments.  On the effective date of such Incremental Commitments, each Additional Lender added as a new Lender pursuant to such Incremental Commitments shall become a Lender for all purposes in connection with this Agreement.

outstanding (A) participations hereunder in Letters of Credit and (B) participations hereunder held by each Revolving Lender (including each such Commitment Increase Lender) will equal the percentage of the Total Revolving Credit Commitment of all Revolving Lenders represented by such Revolving Lenders Incremental Revolving Commitment and (ii) if, on the date of such increase or new facility, there are any Revolving Loans outstanding, such Revolving Loans shall on or prior to the effectiveness of such Incremental Revolving Facility be prepaid from the proceeds of additional Incremental Revolving Loans made hereunder (reflecting such Incremental Revolving Facility), which prepayment shall be accompanied by accrued interest on the Revolving Loans being prepaid and any costs incurred by any Revolving Lender in accordance with Section 2.15.  The Administrative Agent and the Revolving Lenders hereby agree that the minimum borrowing, pro rata borrowing and pro rata payment requirements contained elsewhere in this Agreement shall not apply to the transactions effected pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence; provided, however, that, after giving effect to any Incremental Revolving Facility and the transactions effected pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, (1) the borrowing and repayment (except for (A) payments of interest and fees at different rates under any Incremental Revolving Facility, (B) repayments required upon the maturity date of any previously existing Revolving Credit Commitments and (C) repayments made in connection with a permanent repayment and termination of commitments (subject to clause (3) below)) of Loans with respect to any Incremental Revolving Facility shall be made on a pro rata basis with all other Revolving Credit Commitments, (2) all Letters of Credit shall be participated on a pro rata basis by all Lenders with Commitments in accordance with their percentage of the Revolving Credit Commitments and (3) the permanent repayment of Revolving Loans with respect to, and termination of, commitments under any Incremental Revolving Facility shall be made on a pro rata basis with all other Revolving Credit Commitments, except that the Borrower shall be permitted, in their sole discretion, to permanently repay and terminate commitments of any class of Revolving Credit Commitments on better than a pro rata basis as compared to any other class with a later maturity date than such class.
 
(h)                                 Effective on the date of each increase in the Total Revolving Credit Commitments pursuant to this Section 2.21, the maximum amount of LC Exposure permitted hereunder shall increase by an amount, if any, agreed upon by Administrative Agent, Issuing Banks and the Borrower.
 
(i)                                     The Lenders hereby irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent to enter into amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents with the Loan Parties as may be necessary in order to establish new tranches or sub-tranches in respect of Loans or commitments increased or extended pursuant to this Section 2.21 and such technical amendments as may be necessary or appropriate in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower in connection with the establishment of such new tranches or sub-tranches, in each case on terms consistent with this Section 2.21.
 
(j)                                    This Section 2.21 shall supersede any provisions in Section 2.17 or 9.02 to the contrary.

Section 2.22.                          Extensions of Loans and Revolving Commitments.
 
(a)                                 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, pursuant to one or more offers (each, an Extension Offer) made from time to time by the Borrower to all Lenders
 
92





 
holding Loans of any Class with a like maturity date or commitments with a like maturity date

                         With respect to all Extensions consummated by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.22, (i) such Extensions shall not constitute voluntary or mandatory payments for purposes of Section 2.10, (ii) the scheduled amortization payments (in so far as such schedule affects payments
 
94





 
due to Lenders participating in the relevant Class) set forth in Section 2.09 shall be adjusted to give effect to the Extension of the relevant Class and (iii) except as set forth in clause (a)(viii) above, no Extension Offer is required to be in any minimum amount or any minimum increment; provided that the Borrower may at its election specify as a condition (a Minimum Extension Condition) to consummating any such Extension that a minimum amount (to be determined and specified in the relevant Extension Offer in the Borrowers sole discretion and which may be waived by the Borrower) of Loans or commitments (as applicable) of any or all applicable tranches be tendered.  The Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereby consent to the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.22 (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the payment of any interest, fees or premium in respect of any Extended Term Loans and/or Extended Revolving Credit Commitments on such terms as may be set forth in the relevant Extension Offer) and hereby waive the requirements of any provision of this Agreement (including Sections 2.09, 2.10 or 2.17) or any other Loan Document that may otherwise prohibit any such Extension or any other transaction contemplated by this Section.
 
(c)                                  No consent of any Lender or the Administrative Agent shall be required to effectuate any Extension, other than the consent of each Lender agreeing to such Extension with respect to one or more of its Loans and/or commitments under any Class (or a portion thereof).  All Extended Term Loans and Extended Revolving Credit Commitments and all obligations in respect thereof shall be Secured Obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents that are secured by the Collateral and guaranteed on a pari passu basis with all other applicable Secured Obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.  The Lenders hereby irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent to enter into amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents with the Borrower as may be necessary in order to establish new tranches or sub-tranches in respect of Loans or commitments so extended and such technical amendments as may be necessary or appropriate in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower in connection with the establishment of such new tranches or sub-tranches, in each case on terms consistent with this Section 2.22.
 
(d)                                 In connection with any Extension, the Borrower shall provide the Administrative Agent at least ten Business Days (or such shorter period as may be agreed by the Administrative Agent) prior written notice thereof, and shall agree to such procedures (including regarding timing, rounding and other adjustments and to ensure reasonable administrative management of the credit facilities hereunder after such Extension), if any, as may be established by, or acceptable to, the Administrative Agent, in each case acting reasonably to accomplish the purposes of this Section 2.22.
 
Section 2.23.                          Permitted Debt Exchanges.
 
(a)                                 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, pursuant to one or more offers (each, a Permitted Debt Exchange Offer) made from time to time by the Borrower to all Lenders (other than, with respect to any Permitted Debt Exchange Offer that constitutes an offering of securities, any Lender that, if requested by the Borrower, is unable to certify that it is (i) a qualified institutional buyer (as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act), (ii) an institutional accredited investor (as defined in Rule 501 under the Securities Act) or (iii) not a U.S. person (as defined in Rule 902 under the Securities Act)) with outstanding Term Loans of a particular Class, the Borrower may from time to time consummate one or more exchanges of such Term Loans for Indebtedness (in the for

ARTICLE 8                              THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT
 
Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks hereby irrevocably appoints JPMorgan (or any successor appointed pursuant hereto) as its agent and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf, including execution of the other Loan Documents, and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms of the Loan Documents, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.
 
Any Person serving as Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent and the term Lender or Lenders shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated, unless the context otherwise requires or unless such Person is in fact not a Lender, include each Person serving as Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity.  Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with the Loan Parties or any subsidiary of a Loan Party or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder.  The Lenders acknowledge that, pursuant to such activities, the Administrative Agent or its Affiliates may receive information regarding any Loan Party or any of its Affiliates (including information that may be subject to confidentiality obligations in favor of such Loan Party or such Affiliate) and acknowledge that the Administrative Agent shall not be under any obligation to provide such information to them.
 
The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth in the Loan Documents.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the use of the term agent herein and in the other Loan Documents with reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law and instead, such term is used merely as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between independent contracting parties (and each Lender and Issuing Bank agrees that it will not assert any claim against the Administrative Agent based on an alleged breach of fiduciary duty by the Administrative Agent in connection with this Agreement and/or the transactions contemplated hereby), (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers that are expressly contemplated by the Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise in
 
146





 
writing as directed by the Required Lenders or Required Revolving Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.02); provided, that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable laws and (c) except as expressly set forth in the Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.  The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders or Required Revolving Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.02) or in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, in connection with its duties expressly set forth herein.  The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any Default or Event of Default unless and until written notice thereof stating it is notice of such Default or Event of Default is given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower or any Lender, and the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with any Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or in connection with any Loan Document, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth in any Loan Document or the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of any Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, (v) the creation, perfection or priority of Liens on the Collateral or the existence, value or sufficiency of the Collateral, (vi) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article 4 or elsewhere in any Loan Document, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent or (vii) the properties, books or records of any Loan Party or any Affiliate thereof.
 
Each Lender agrees that, except with the written consent of the Administrative Agent, it will not take any enforcement action hereunder or under any other Loan Document, accelerate the Obligations under any Loan Document, or exercise any right that it might otherwise have under applicable law or otherwise to credit bid at foreclosure sales, UCC sales, any sale under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code or other similar Dispositions of Collateral.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, a Lender may take action to preserve or enforce its rights against a Loan Party where a deadline or limitation period is applicable that would, absent such action, bar enforcement of the Obligations held by such Lender, including the filing of proofs of claim in a case under the Bankruptcy Code.
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any of the other Loan Documents, the Loan Parties, the Administrative Agent and each Secured Party agrees that (i) no Secured Party shall have any right individually to realize upon any of the Collateral or to enforce the Loan Guaranty, it being understood and agreed that all powers, rights and remedies hereunder may be exercised solely by the Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Secured Parties in accordance with the terms hereof and all powers, rights and remedies under the other Loan Documents may be exercised solely by the Administrative Agent, and (ii) in the event of a foreclosure by the Administrative Agent on any of the Collateral pursuant to a public or private Disposition (including pursuant to Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code), (A) the Administrative Agent, as agent for and representative of the Secured Parties, shall be entitled, for the purpose of bidding and making settlement or payment of the purchase price for all or any portion of the Collateral sold at any such Disposition, to use and apply any of the Obligations as a credit on account of the purchase price for any Collateral payable by the Administrative Agent at such Disposition and (B) the Administrative Agent or any Lender may be the purchaser or licensor of any or all of such Collateral at any such Disposition.
 
147





 
No holder of Secured Hedging Obligations or Banking Services Obligations shall have any rights in connection with the management or release of any Collateral or of the obligations of any Loan Guarantor under this Agreement or any other Loan Document.
 
Each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably authorizes (and by entering into a Hedge Agreement with respect to Secured Hedging Obligations and/or by entering into documentation in connection with Banking Services Obligations, each of the other Secured Parties hereby authorizes and shall be deemed to authorize) the Administrative Agent, on behalf of all Secured Parties to take any of the following actions upon the instruction of the Required Lenders:
 
(a)                                 consent to the Disposition of all or any portion of the Collateral free and clear of the Liens securing the Secured Obligations in connection with any such Disposition or other transfer pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, including Section 363 thereof;
 
(b)                                 credit bid all or any portion of the Secured Obligations, or purchase all or any portion of the Collateral, (in each case, either directly or through one or more acquisition vehicles) in connection with any Disposition of all or any portion of the Collateral pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, including under Section 363 thereof;
 
(c)                                  credit bid all or any portion of the Secured Obligations, or purchase all or any portion of the Collateral, (in each case, either directly or through one or more acquisition vehicles) in connection with any Disposition of all or any portion of the Collateral pursuant to the applicable provisions of the UCC, including pursuant to Sections 9-610 or 9-620 of the UCC; and/or
 
(d)                                 credit bid all or any portion of the Secured Obligations, or purchase all or any portion of the Collateral, (in each case, either directly or through one or more acquisition vehicles) in connection with any foreclosure or other Disposition conducted in accordance with applicable law following the occurrence of an Event of Default, including by power of sale, judicial action or otherwise;
 
it being understood that no Lender shall be required to fund any amounts in connection with any purchase of all or any portion of the Collateral by the Administrative Agent pursuant to the foregoing clauses (b), (c) or (d) without its prior written consent.
 
Each Lender and each other Secured Party agrees that the Administrative Agent is under no obligation to credit bid any part of the Secured Obligations or to purchase or retain or acquire any portion of the Collateral; provided that, in connection with any credit bid or purchase under clause (b), (c) or (d) of the preceding paragraph, the Secured Obligations owed to all of the Secured Parties (other than with respect to contingent or unliquidated liabilities as set forth in the next succeeding paragraph) shall be entitled to be, and shall be, credit bid by the Administrative Agent on a ratable basis.
 
With respect to each contingent or unliquidated claim that is a Secured Obligation, the Administrative Agent is hereby authorized, but is not required, to estimate the amount of any such claim for purposes of the credit bid or purchase so long as the fixing or liquidation of such claim would not unduly delay the ability of the Administrative Agent to credit bid the Secured Obligations or purchase the Collateral at such Disposition.  In the event that the Administrative Agent, in its sole and absolute discretion, elects not to estimate any such contingent or unliquidated claim or any such claim cannot be estimated without unduly delaying the ability of the Administrative Agent to credit bid or purchase in accordance with the second preceding paragraph, then those of the contingent or unliquidated claims not so estimated shall be disregarded, shall not be credit bid, and shall not be entitled to any interest in the portion or the entirety of the Collateral purchased by means of such credit bid.
 
148





 
Each Secured Party whose Secured Obligations are credit bid under clauses (b), (c) or (d) of the third preceding paragraph shall be entitled to receive interests in the Collateral or other asset or assets acquired in connection with such credit bid (or in the Capital Stock of the acquisition vehicle or vehicles that are used to consummate such acquisition) on a ratable basis in accordance with the percentage obtained by dividing (x) the amount of the Secured Obligations of such Secured Party that were credit bid in such credit bid or Disposition, by (y) the aggregate amount of all Secured Obligations that were credit bid in such credit bid or Disposition.
 
In addition, in case of the pendency of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or any other judicial proceeding relative to any Loan Party, each Secured Party agrees that the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan or LC Exposure shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise:
 
(a)                                 to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans or LC Exposure and all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Administrative Agent (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Administrative Agent and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts to the extent due to the Lenders and the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.11 and 9.03) allowed in such judicial proceeding;
 
(b)                                 to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same; and
 
(c)                                  to receive payments from any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding and, in the event that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders and the Issuing Banks, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amount to the extent due to the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.11 and 9.03.
 
Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender or any Issuing Bank any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Lender or any Issuing Bank or to authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender or any Issuing Bank in any such proceeding.
 
The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person.  The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon.  In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, or the issuance of a Letter of Credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or the applicable Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent and Issuing Bank may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender unless the Administrative Agent or Issuing Bank shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender or Issuing Bank prior to the making of such Loan or the issuance of such Letter of Credit.  The Administrative Agent and the Issuing
 
149





 
Bank may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
 
The Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related Parties.  The exculpatory provisions of this Article 8 shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as the Administrative Agent.
 
The Administrative Agent may resign at any time by giving ten days prior written notice to the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Borrower.  If the Administrative Agent is a Defaulting Lender or an Affiliate of a Defaulting Lender, the Borrower may, upon ten days notice, remove the Administrative Agent.  Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation or removal, the Required Lenders shall have the right, with the consent of the Borrower (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), to appoint a successor Administrative Agent which shall be a commercial bank with an office in the U.S. having combined capital and surplus in excess of $1,000,000,000; provided that during the existence and continuation of an Event of Default under Section 7.01(a) or, with respect to the Borrower, Section 7.01(f) or (g), no consent of the Borrower shall be required; provided, further, that in no event shall a Disqualified Institution be the successor Administrative Agent.  If no successor shall have been so appointed as provided above and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then (a) in the case of a retirement, the retiring Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to), on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Borrower consent, if required) set forth above or (b) in the case of a removal, the Borrower may, after consulting with the Required Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above; provided that (x) in the case of a retirement, if such Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower, the Lenders and the Issuing Banks that no qualifying Person has accepted such appointment or (y) in the case of a removal, the Borrower notifies the Required Lenders that no qualifying Person has accepted such appointment, then, in each case, such resignation or removal shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice and (i) the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and (ii) all payments and communications provided to be made to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made to each Lender and Issuing Bank directly (and each Lender and Issuing Bank will cooperate with the Borrower to enable the Borrower to take such actions), and all determinations provided to be made by the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by the Required Lenders, in each case, until such time as the Required Lenders or the Borrower, as applicable, appoint a successor Administrative Agent, as provided for above in this Article 8.  Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent (other than any rights to indemnity payments owed to the retiring Administrative Agent), and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder.  The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor.  After the Administrative Agents resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article 8 and Section 9.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as Administrative Agent.
 
Each Lender and each Issuing Bank acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such
 
150





 
documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement.  Each Lender and each Issuing Bank also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon either Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.  Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders and the Issuing Banks by the Administrative Agent herein, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender or Issuing Bank with any credit or other information concerning the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition or creditworthiness of any of the Loan Parties or any of their respective Affiliates which may come into the possession of the Administrative Agent or any of its Related Parties.  Each Lender and Issuing Bank, by delivering its signature page to this Agreement on the Closing Date, or delivering its signature page to an Assignment and Assumption or any other Loan Document pursuant to which it shall become a Lender or Issuing Bank hereunder, shall be deemed to have acknowledged receipt of, and consented to and approved, each Loan Document and each other document required to be delivered to, or be approved by or satisfactory to, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders or the Issuing Banks on the Closing Date.
 
Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the Arrangers and the bookrunners shall not have any right, power, obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this Agreement, except in their respective capacities, as applicable, as the Administrative Agent, an Issuing Bank or a Lender hereunder.
 
Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks irrevocably authorize and instruct the Administrative Agent to, and the Administrative Agent shall,
 
(a)                                 release any Lien on any property granted to or held by the Administrative Agent under any Loan Document (i) upon the occurrence of the Termination Date, (ii) that is sold or to be sold or transferred as part of or in connection with any Disposition permitted under the Loan Documents to a Person that is not a Loan Party, (iii) that does not constitute (or ceases to constitute) Collateral, (iv) if the property subject to such Lien is owned by a Subsidiary Guarantor, upon the release of such Subsidiary Guarantor from its Loan Guaranty otherwise in accordance with the Loan Documents, (v) as required under clause (d) below or (vi) if approved, authorized or ratified in writing by the Required Lenders in accordance with Section 9.02; provided that for the avoidance of doubt, such Lien shall be deemed automatically released without further action of the Administrative Agent to the extent set forth in the last paragraph of Section 6.07 or Section 10.12;
 
(a)                                 release any Subsidiary Guarantor from its obligations under the Loan Guaranty if such Person ceases to be a Subsidiary (or becomes an Excluded Subsidiary) as a result of a single transaction or related series of transactions permitted hereunder; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, such Subsidiary Guarantor shall be deemed automatically released from the Loan Guaranty without further action of the Administrative Agent to the extent set forth in Section 10.12 (this clause (b), together with clause (a) above, collectively, the Release Provisions);
 
(b)                                 subordinate any Lien on any property granted to or held by the Administrative Agent under any Loan Document to the holder of any Lien on such property that is permitted pursuant to Section 6.02(d), (e), (f), (g), (k) (solely with respect to Indebtedness permitted by Sections 6.01(i), (l) and (m) (to the extent such Indebtedness is secured by Section 6.02(u))), (l), (m), (n), (o)(i), (p), (q), (r), (u), (x), (y) (but in respect to Sections 6.01(aa) and (bb), solely to the extent securing any Cash or Cash Equivalents or any other property that does not constitute Collateral), (bb), (cc), (dd) (solely to the extent securing any Cash or Cash Equivalents or any other property that does not constitute Collateral), (ee) and (gg); and
 
151





 
(c)                                  enter into subordination, intercreditor and/or similar agreements with respect to Indebtedness that is (i) required or permitted to be subordinated hereunder and/or (ii) secured by Liens, and which Indebtedness contemplates an intercreditor, subordination or collateral trust agreement.
 
Upon request by the Administrative Agent at any time, the Required Lenders will confirm in writing the Administrative Agents authority to release or subordinate its interest in particular types or items of property, or to release any Loan Guarantor from its obligations under the Loan Guaranty pursuant to this Article 8 and Section 10.12 hereunder.  In each case as specified in this Article 8, the Administrative Agent will (and each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to), at the Borrowers expense, execute and deliver to the applicable Loan Party such documents and make any necessary or advisable filings as such Loan Party may reasonably request to evidence the release of such item of Collateral from the assignment and security interest granted under the Collateral Documents or to subordinate its interest in such item, or to release such Loan Guarantor from its obligations under the Loan Guaranty, in each case in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents and this Article 8 (and the Administrative Agent expressly acknowledges such direction and agrees to enter into the necessary and advisable documents and make any such filings which are requested by the Borrower; provided that it is understood that the Administrative Agent shall (if such a certificate is delivered) rely on a certificate of the Borrower, delivered at the Borrowers sole election, confirming any release or subordination contemplated herein is permitted by the Loan Documents; provided further that the Administrative Agent shall execute any documents requested by the Borrower (and file any requested filings) in connection with such release (and shall return any pledged Collateral no longer constituting Collateral) no later than five Business Days following the delivery of such certificate and the delivery of the applicable draft release documents).
 
The Administrative Agent is authorized to enter into any intercreditor agreement contemplated hereby with respect to Indebtedness that is (i) required or permitted to be subordinated hereunder and/or (ii) secured by Liens and which Indebtedness contemplates an intercreditor, subordination or collateral trust agreement (any such other intercreditor agreement, an Additional Agreement), and the parties hereto acknowledge that any Additional Agreement is binding upon them.  Each Lender and Issuing Bank (a) hereby consents to the subordination of the Liens on the Collateral securing the Secured Obligations on the terms set forth in any Additional Agreement, (b) hereby agrees that it will be bound by and will take no actions contrary to the provisions of any Additional Agreement and (c) hereby authorizes and instructs the Administrative Agent to enter into any Additional Agreement and to subject the Liens on the Collateral securing the Secured Obligations to the provisions thereof.  The foregoing provisions are intended as an inducement to the Secured Parties to extend credit to the Borrower and such Secured Parties are intended third-party beneficiaries of such provisions and the provisions of any Additional Agreement.
 
To the extent the Administrative Agent or Issuing Banks (or in each case any Affiliate thereof) is not reimbursed and indemnified by the Borrower, the Lenders will reimburse and indemnify the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Banks (and in each case any Affiliate thereof) in proportion to their respective Applicable Percentage for and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, claims, actions, judgments, costs, expenses or disbursements of whatsoever kind or nature which may be imposed on, asserted against or incurred by the Administrative Agent or Issuing Bank (or any Affiliate thereof) in performing its duties hereunder or under any other Loan Document or in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any other Loan Document in its (or any of its Affiliates) capacity as Administrative Agent or Issuing Bank; provided that no Lender shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, claims, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from the Administrative Agents or the Issuing Banks (or each such Affiliates) gross negligence or willful misconduct (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable decision).

Section 9.02.                          Waivers; Amendments.
 
(a)                                 No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power.  The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders hereunder and under any other Loan Document are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have.  No waiver of any provision of any Loan Document or consent to any departure by any Loan Party therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section 9.02, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for

the purpose for which given.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to the extent permitted by law, the making of a Loan or issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default or Event of Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, any Lender or Issuing Bank may have had notice or knowledge of such Default or Event of Default at the time.
 
(b)           Subject to clauses (A), (B) and (C) and Section 9.02(c) below, neither this Agreement nor any other Loan Document nor any provision hereof or thereof may be waived, amended or modified, except (i) in the case of this Agreement, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrower and the Required Lenders (or the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders) or (ii) in the case of any other Loan Document (other than any such waiver, amendment or modification to effectuate any modification thereto expressly contemplated by the terms of such other Loan Documents), pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Administrative Agent and the Loan Party or Loan Parties that are parties thereto, with the consent of the Required Lenders; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing:
 
(A)          solely with the consent of each Lender directly and adversely affected thereby (but without the necessity of obtaining the consent of the Required Lenders), any such agreement may;
 
(1)           increase the Commitment or Additional Commitment of such Lender (other than with respect to any Incremental Revolving Facility pursuant to Section 2.21 in respect of which such Lender has agreed to be an Additional Lender); it being understood that no amendment, modification or waiver of, or consent to departure from, any condition precedent, representation, warranty, covenant, Default, Event of Default, mandatory prepayment or mandatory reduction of the Commitments or Additional Commitments shall constitute an increase of any Commitment or Additional Commitment of such Lender;
 
(2)           reduce or forgive the principal amount of any Loan, unreimbursed LC Disbursement or any amount due on any Loan Installment Date;
 
(3)           extend the scheduled final maturity of any Loan, unreimbursed LC Disbursement or postpone any Loan Installment Date or the date of any scheduled payment of interest, fees or LC Disbursement payable hereunder (in each case, other than extensions for administrative reasons agreed by the Administrative Agent);
 
(4)           reduce the rate of interest (other than to waive any obligations of the Borrower to pay interest at the default rate of interest under Section 2.12(c)) or the amount of any fees owed to such Lender; it being understood that any change in any ratio used in the calculation of any interest or fees due hereunder (including any component definition thereof) shall not constitute a reduction in any rate of interest or fees hereunder;
 
(5)           extend the expiry date of such Lenders Commitment or Additional Commitment; it being understood that no amendment, modification or waiver of, or consent to departure from, any condition precedent, representation, warranty, covenant, Default, Event of Default, mandatory prepayment or mandatory reduction of the Commitments or Additional Commitments shall constitute an extension of any Commitment or Additional Commitment of any Lender; or

(vi)          By executing and delivering an Assignment and Assumption, the assigning Lender thereunder and the Eligible Assignee thereunder shall be deemed to confirm and agree with each other and the other parties hereto as follows: (A) such assigning Lender warrants that it is the legal and beneficial owner of the interest being assigned thereby free and clear of any adverse claim and that the amount of its commitments, and the outstanding balances of its Loans, in each case without giving effect to assignments thereof which have not become effective, are as set forth in such Assignment and Assumption; (B) except as set forth in clause (A) above, such assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibil

enuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto, or the financial condition of the Borrower or any Subsidiary or the performance or observance by the Borrower or any Subsidiary of any of its obligations under this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; (C) such assignee represents and warrants that it is an Eligible Assignee, legally authorized to enter into such Assignment and Assumption; (D) such assignee confirms that it has received a copy of this Agreement, together with copies of the most recent financial statements referred to in Section 3.04(a) or delivered pursuant to Section 5.01(a) or (b), as applicable, and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into such Assignment and Assumption; (E) such assignee will independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, such assigning Lender or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement; (F) such assignee appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement as are delegated to the Administrative Agent, by the terms hereof,
 
163

(c)           (i)  Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks or any other Lender, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (other than to any Disqualified Institution, any natural person (or a holding company, investment vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated for the primary benefit of, a natural person) or, other than with respect to participations to Debt Fund Affiliates (any such participations to Debt Fund Affiliates being subject to the limitations set forth in Section 9.05(g)), the Investors, Holdings, the Borrower and its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates) (a Participant) in all or a portion of such Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its commitments and the Loans owing to it); provided that (A) such Lenders obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (C) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement.  Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in (x) clause (A) to the first proviso to Section 9.02(b) that directly and adversely affects the Loans or commitments in which such Participant has an interest and (y) clauses (B)(1), (2) or (3) to the first proviso to Section 9.02(b).  Subject to paragraph (c)(ii) of this Section 9.05, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.14, 2.15 and 2.16 (subje

sors and assigns, and principal amount of and interest on the Loans (the Participant Register); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to any Participants interest in any Additional Commitment Loan or any other obligation under any Loan Document) to any Person except (i) to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Additional Commitment, Loan or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the Treasury Regulations or (ii) if compelled by order of the court or other legal process.  The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and each Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.

(d)           Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (other than to any Disqualified Institution or natural person (or a holding company, investment vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated for the primary benefit of, a natural person)) to secure obligations of such Lender, including without limitation any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank or other central bank having jurisdiction over such Lender, and this Section 9.05 shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.
 
(e)           Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender (a Granting Lender) may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle (an SPC), identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Lender to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, the option to provide to the Borrower all or any part of any Loan that such Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to make to the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement; provided that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPC to make any Loan and (ii) if an SPC elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to provide all or any part of such Loan, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to make such Loan pursuant to the terms hereof.  The making of a Loan by an SPC hereunder shall utilize the Commitment or Additional Commitment of the Granting Lender to the same extent, and as if, such Loan were made by such Granting Lender.  Each party hereto hereby agrees that (i) neither the grant to any SPC nor the exercise by any SPC of such option shall increase the costs or expenses or otherwise increase or change the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement (including its obligations under Section 2.14, 2.15 or 2.16) and no SPC shall be enti

(f)            (i) Any assignment or participation by a Lender without the Borrowers consent to a Disqualified Institution or, to the extent the Borrowers consent is required under this Section 9.05, to any other Person, shall be prohibited, and the Borrower shall be entitled to seek specific performance to unwind any such assignment or participation in addition to any other remedies available to the Borrower at law or in equity, including pursuant to Section 9.05(f)(ii); provided that the foregoing shall not apply retroactively to disqualify any parties that have previously acquired an
 
165





 
assignment or participation interest in the Loans to the extent such party was not disqualified at the time of the applicable assignment or participation, as the case may be.
 
(ii)           If any assignment or participation under this Section 9.05 is made to any Affiliate of any Disqualified Institution (other than any Bona Fide Debt Fund that is not itself a Disqualified Institution) without the Borrowers prior written consent or any Disqualified Institution (any such Person, a Disqualified Person), then the Borrower may, at their sole expense and effort, upon notice to the applicable Disqualified Person and the Administrative Agent, (A) terminate any Commitment of such Disqualified Person and repay all obligations of the Borrower owing to such Disqualified Person, (B) in the case of any outstanding Term Loans, purchase such Term Loans by paying the lesser of (x) par and (y) the amount that such Disqualified Person paid to acquire such Term Loans, in the case of clauses (x) and (y), plus accrued interest thereon, accrued fees an all other amounts payable to it hereunder and/or (C) require such Disqualified Person to assign, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in this Section 9.05), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to one or more Eligible Assignees; provided that (I) in the case of clause (B), the applicable Disqualified Person has received payment of an amount equal to the lesser of (1) par and (2) the amount that such Disqualified Person paid for the applicable Loans and participations in letters of credit, if applicable, accrued interes

(iii)          The parties to this Agreement hereby acknowledge and agree that neither the Administrative Agent nor any Arranger, solely in their respective capacities as such, shall be deemed to have any duty or responsibility or to incur any liabilities as a result of a breach of this Section 9.05(f) by any other Lender, nor shall the Administrative Agent nor any Arranger, in their respective capacities as such, have any duty, responsibility or liability to monitor or enforce assignments, participations or other actions in respect of Disqualified Institutions or otherwise take (or omit to take) any action with respect thereto; provided, for the avoidance of doubt, that notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, neither the Administrative Agent nor any Arranger shall be relieved of its obligation to comply with this Section 9.05(f) in its capacity as a Lender hereunder.
 
(g)           Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender may, at any time, assign all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement in respect of its Term Loans to an Affiliated Lender on a non-pro rata basis (A) through Dutch Auctions open to all
 
166





 
applicable Lenders on a pro rata basis or (B) through open market purchases, in each case with respect to clauses (A) and (B), without the consent of the Administrative Agent; provided that:
 
(i)            any Term Loans acquired by Holdings, the Borrower or any of their respective subsidiaries shall be retired and cancelled immediately upon the acquisition thereof; provided that upon any such retirement and cancellation of Indebtedness, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Term Loans or Additional Term Loans, as applicable, shall be deemed reduced by the full par value of the aggregate principal amount of the Term Loans or Additional Term Loans so retired and cancelled, and each principal repayment installment with respect to the Term Loans pursuant to Section 2.09(a) shall be reduced pro rata by the full par value of the aggregate principal amount of Term Loans so cancelled;

(iii)          [reserved];
 
(iv)          each Lender participating in any assignment to Affiliated Lenders acknowledges and agrees that in connection with such assignment, (A) the Affiliated Lenders may have, and later may come into possession of Excluded Information, (B) such Lender has independently and, without reliance on the Affiliated Lenders or any of their Subsidiaries, or Holdings, the Borrower or any of their respective Subsidiaries, the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers or any other Related Parties, made its own analysis and determination to participate in such assignment notwithstanding such Lenders lack of knowledge of the Excluded Information, (C) none of the Affiliated Lenders or any of their Subsidiaries, or Holdings, the Borrower or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to make any representation that it is not in possession of Excluded Information, (D) none of the Affiliated Lenders or any of their Subsidiaries, or Holdings, the Borrower or their respective Subsidiaries, the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers or any other Related Parties shall have any liability to such Lender, and such Lender hereby waives and releases, to the extent permitted by law, any claims such Lender may have against the Affiliated Lenders and any of their Subsidiaries, and Holdings, the Borrower and their respective Subsidiaries, the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers and any other Related Parties, under applicable laws or otherwise, with respect to the nondisclosure of the Excluded Information and (E) that the Excluded Information may not be available to the Administrative Agent or the other Lenders;
 
(v)           after giving effect to such assignment and to all other assignments to all Affiliated Lenders, the aggregate principal amount of all Term Loans and Additional Term Loans then held by all Affiliated Lenders shall not exceed 25.0% of the aggregate principal amount of the Term Loans and Additional Term Loans then outstanding (after giving effect to any substantially simultaneous cancellations thereof) (the Affiliated Lender Cap); provided that each of the parties hereto agrees and acknowledges that the Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any losses, damages, penalties, claims, demands, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses and disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever incurred or suffered by any Person in connection with any compliance or non-compliance with this clause (g)(v) or any purported assignment exceeding such percentage (it being understood and agreed that the cap set forth in this clause (v) is intended to apply to any Loans made available by Affiliated Lenders by means other than formal assignment (e.g., as a result of an acquisition of another Lender (other than a Debt Fund Affiliate)
 
167





 
by an Affiliated Lender or the provision of Additional Term Loans by an Affiliated Lender); provided further, except as specifically set forth in clause (f), that to the extent that any assignment to any Affiliated Lender would result in the aggregate principal amount of all Term Loans and Additional Term Loans held by Affiliated Lenders exceeding the Affiliated Lender Cap (after giving effect to any substantially simultaneous cancellations thereof), the assignment of the relevant excess amount shall be automatically cancelled;
 
(vi)          in connection with any assignment effected pursuant to a Dutch Auction and/or open market purchase conducted by Holdings, the Borrower or any of its subsidiaries, (A) the relevant Person may not use the proceeds of any Revolving Facility, any Incremental Revolving Facility, any Extended Revolving Credit Commitment or any Replacement Revolving Facility to fund such assignment and (B) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of acceptance of bids for the Dutch Auction or the confirmation of such open market purchase;
 
(vii)         in connection with each assignment pursuant to this clause (g), the Administrative Agent shall have been provided written notice in connection with each assignment to an Affiliated Lender or a Person that upon effectiveness of such assignment would constitute an Affiliated Lender with respect to the identity of such Affiliated Lender and the amount of the Loans being assigned thereto;
 
(viii)        by its acquisition of Term Loans or Additional Term Loans, an Affiliated Lender shall be deemed to have acknowledged and agreed that:
 
(A)          the Term Loans and Additional Term Loans held by such Affiliated Lender shall be disregarded in both the numerator and denominator in the calculation of Required Lenders or any other Lender vote (or the Term Loans and Additional Term Loans held by such Affiliated Lender shall be deemed to be voted pro rata along with the other Lenders that are not Affiliated Lenders), except that such Affiliated Lender shall have the right to vote (and the Term Loans and Additional Term Loans held by such Affiliated Lender shall not be so disregarded) with respect to any amendment, modification, waiver, consent or other action that requires the vote of all Lenders or all Lenders directly and adversely affected thereby, as the case may be; provided that no amendment, modification, waiver, consent or other action shall (1) disproportionately affect such Affiliated Lender in its capacity as a Lender as compared to other Lenders of the same Class that are not Affiliated Lenders or (2) deprive any Affiliated Lender of its share of any payments which the Lenders are entitled to share on a pro rata basis hereunder, in each case without the consent of such Affiliated Lender; and
 
(B)          Affiliated Lenders, solely in their capacity as an Affiliated Lender, will not be entitled to (i) attend (including by telephone) or participate in any meeting or discussions (or portion thereof) among the Administrative Agent or any Lender or among Lenders to which the Loan Parties or their representatives are not invited or (ii) receive any information or material prepared by the Administrative Agent or any Lender or any communication by or among the Administrative Agent and one or more Lenders, except to the extent such information or materials have been made available by the Administrative Agent or any Lender to any Loan Party or its representatives (and in any case, other than the right to receive notices of Borrowings, prepayments and other administrative notices in respect of its Term Loans or Additional Term Loans required to be delivered to Lenders pursuant to Article 2).
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender may, at any time, assign all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement in respect of its Term Loans or Additional Term Loans, to a Debt Fund Affiliate, and any Debt Fund Affiliate may, from time to time, purchase Term Loans
 
168





 
or Additional Term Loans, (x) on a non-pro rata basis through Dutch Auctions open to all applicable Lenders or (y) on a non-pro rata basis through open market purchases without the consent of the Administrative Agent, in each case, without the necessity of meeting the requirements set forth in (or being subject to the restriction of) subclauses (i) through (viii) of this clause (g); provided that the Term Loans or Additional Term Loans of any Debt Fund Affiliates shall not account for more than 49.9% of the amounts included in determining whether the Required Lenders have (A) consented to any amendment, modification, waiver, consent or other action with respect to any of the terms of any Loan Document or any departure by any Loan Party therefrom, or subject to the immediately succeeding paragraph, any plan of reorganization pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code, (B) otherwise acted on any matter related to any Loan Document or (C) directed or required the Administrative Agent or any Lender to undertake any action (or refrain from taking any action) with respect to or under any Loan Document.  Any Term Loans or Additional Term Loans acquired by any Debt Fund Affiliate may (but shall not be required to) be contributed to Holdings, the Borrower or any of its subsidiaries for purposes of cancellation of such Indebtedness (it being understood that such Term Loans or Additional Term Loans so contributed shall be retired and cancelled immediately upon such contribution); provided that upon such cancellation of Indebtedness, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Term Loans or Additional Term Loans shall be deemed reduced, as of the date of such contribution, by the full par value of the aggregate principal amount of the Term Loans or Additional Term Loans so contributed and cancelled, and each principal repayment installment with respect to the Term Loans pursuant to Section 2.09(a) shall be reduced pro rata by the full par value of the aggregate principal amount of Term Loans so contributed and cancelled.
 
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or the other Loan Documents to the contrary, each Affiliated Lender hereby agrees that, if a proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law shall be commenced by or against the Borrower or any other Loan Party at a time when such Lender is an Affiliated Lender, such Affiliated Lender irrevocably authorizes and empowers the Administrative Agent to vote on behalf of such Affiliated Lender with respect to the Term Loans or Additional Term Loans held by such Affiliated Lender in any manner in the Administrative Agents sole discretion, unless the Administrative Agent instructs such Affiliated Lender to vote, in which case such Affiliated Lender shall vote with respect to the Term Loans or Additional Term Loans held by it as the Administrative Agent directs; provided that (a) such Affiliated Lender shall be entitled to vote in accordance with its sole discretion (and not in accordance with the direction of the Administrative Agent) and (b) the Administrative Agent shall not be entitled to vote on behalf of such Affiliated Lender, in each case, in connection with any matter to the extent any such matter proposes to treat any Obligations held by such Affiliated Lender in a manner that is different than the proposed treatment of similar Obligations held by Lenders that are not Affiliates of the Borrower.  Each Affiliated Lender hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent (such appointment being coupled with an interest) as such Affiliated Lenders attorney-in-fact, with full authority in the place and stead of such Affiliated Lender and in the name of such Affiliated Lender (solely in respect of Term Loans or Additional Term Loans and participations therein and not in respect of any other claim or status such Affiliated Lender may otherwise have), from time to time in the Administrative Agents discretion to take any action and to execute any instrument that the Administrative Agent may deem reasonably necessary to carry out the provisions of (but subject to the limitations set forth in) this paragraph.
 
Section 9.06.         Survival.  All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the Loan Parties in the Loan Documents and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents and the making of any Loans and issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or Event of Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect until the Termination Date.  The provisions of Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16, 9.03 and 9.13 and Article 8 shall survive

Section 9.07.         Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness.  This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract.  This Agreement, the other Loan Documents and the Fee Letter and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the Administrative Agent or the Arrangers constitute the entire agreement among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof.  Except as provided in Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by Holdings, the Borrower, the Subsidiaries of the Borrower party hereto and the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof which, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.  Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by facsimile or by email as a .pdf or .tif attachment shall be effective as delivery of an original executed counterpart of this Agreement.

Section 9.09.         Right of Setoff.  If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, upon the written consent of the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Bank and each Lender and each of its respective Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other obligations at any time owing by the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Bank or such Lender or Affiliate (including by branches and agencies of the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Bank or such Lender, wherever located) to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower or any Loan Guarantor against any of and all the Secured Obligations held by the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Bank or such Lender or Affiliate, irrespective of whether or not the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Bank or such Lender or Affiliate shall have made any demand under the Loan Documents and although such obligations may be unmatured.  Any applicable Lender, Issuing Bank or Affiliate shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of such set-off or application; provided that any failure to give or any delay in giving such notice shall not affect the validity of any such set-off or application under this Section.  The rights of each Lender, each Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent and Affiliate under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which such Lender, Issuing Bank, Administrative Agent or Affiliate may have.

Each Qualified ECP Guarantor hereby jointly and severally absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably undertakes to provide such funds or other support as may be needed from time to time by each other Loan Party to honor all of its obligations under this Loan Guaranty in respect of Hedging Obligations (provided, however, that each Qualified ECP Guarantor shall only be liable under this Section 10.01 for the maximum amount of such liability that can be hereby incurred without rendering its obligations under this Section 10.01, or otherwise under this Loan Guaranty, as it relates to such other Loan Party, voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer, and not for any greater amount).  The obligations of each Qualified ECP Guarantor under this Section 10.01 shall remain in full force and effect until the termination of this Loan Guaranty in accordance with Section 10.12 hereof.  Each Qualified ECP Guarantor intends that this Section 10.01 constitute, and this Section 10.01 shall be deemed to constitute, a keepwell, support, or other agreement for the benefit of each other Loan Party for all purposes of Section 1a(18)(A)(v)(II) of the Commodity Exchange Act.
 
Section 10.02.      Guaranty of Payment.  This Loan Guaranty is a guaranty of payment and not of collection.  Each Loan Guarantor waives any right to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to sue the Borrower, any other Loan Guarantor, any other guarantor, or any other Person obligated for all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations (each, an Obligated Party), or otherwise to enforce its rights in respect of any Collateral securing all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations.  The Administrative Agent may enforce this Loan Guaranty upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default.
 
Section 10.03.      No Discharge or Diminishment of Loan Guaranty.
 
(a)           Except as otherwise provided for herein, the obligations of each Loan Guarantor hereunder are unconditional, irrevocable and absolute and not subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason (other than as set forth in Section 10.12), including: (i) any claim of waiver, release, extension, renewal, settlement, surrender, alteration, or compromise of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, by operation of law or otherwise; (ii) any change in the corporate existence, structure or ownership of the Borrower or any other Guarantor of or other Person liable for any of the Guaranteed Obligations; (iii) any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar proceeding affecting any Obligated Party, or their assets or any resulting release or discharge of any obligation of any Obligated Party; (iv) the existence of any claim, setoff or other rights which any Loan Guarantor may have at any time against any Obligated Party, the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any other Person, whether in connection herewith or in any unrelated transactions; (v) any direction as to application of payments by the Borrower or by any other party; (vi) any other continuing or other guaranty, undertaking or maximum liability of a Guarantor or of any other party as to the Guaranteed Obligations; (vii) any payment on or in reduction of any such other guaranty or undertaking; (viii) any dissolution, termination or increase, decrease or change in personnel by the Borrower; or (ix) any payment made to any Secured Party on the Guaranteed Obligations which any such Secured Party repays to the Borrower pursuant to court order in any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, moratorium or other debtor relief proceeding, and each Loan Guarantor waives any right to the deferral or modification of its obligations hereunder by reason of any such proceeding.
 
(b)           Except for termination of a Loan Guarantors obligations hereunder or as expressly permitted by Section 10.12, the obligations of each Loan Guarantor hereunder are not subject to any defense or setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, or termination whatsoever by reason of the invalidity,
 
177





 
illegality, or unenforceability of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or otherwise, or any provision of applicable law or regulation purporting to prohibit payment by any Obligated Party, of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof.
 
(c)           Further, the obligations of any Loan Guarantor hereunder are not discharged or impaired or otherwise affected by: (i) the failure of the Administrative Agent or any Secured Party to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any remedy with respect to all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations; (ii) any waiver or modification of or supplement to any provision of any agreement relating to the Guaranteed Obligations; (iii) any release, non-perfection, or invalidity of any indirect or direct security for the obligations of the Borrower for all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations or any obligations of any other guarantor of or other Person liable for any of the Guaranteed Obligations; (iv) any action or failure to act by the Administrative Agent or any Secured Party with respect to any Collateral securing any part of the Guaranteed Obligations; or (v) any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the payment or performance of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any other circumstance, act, omission or delay that might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of such Loan Guarantor or that would otherwise operate as a discharge of any Loan Guarantor as a matter of law or equity (other than as set forth in Section 10.12).
 
Section 10.04.      Defenses Waived.  To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and except for termination of a Loan Guarantors obligations hereunder or as expressly permitted by Section 10.12, each Loan Guarantor hereby waives any defense based on or arising out of any defense of the Borrower or any other Loan Guarantor or arising out of the disability of the Borrower or any other Loan Guarantor or any other party or the unenforceability of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligat

the Borrower or any other Loan Guarantor.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Loan Guarantor irrevocably waives acceptance hereof, presentment, demand, protest and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any notice not provided for herein, including notices of nonperformance, notices of protest, notices of dishonor, notices of acceptance of this Loan Guaranty, and notices of the existence, creation or incurring of new or additional Guaranteed Obligations, as well as any requirement that at any time any action be taken by any Person against any Obligated Party, or any other Person, including any right (except as shall be required by applicable statute and cannot be waived) to require any Secured Party to (i) proceed against the Borrower, any other guarantor or any other party, (ii) proceed against or exhaust any security held from the Borrower, any other Loan Guarantor or any other party or (iii) pursue any other remedy in any Secured Partys power whatsoever.  The Administrative Agent may, at its election, foreclose on any Collateral held by it by one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, whether or not every aspect of any such sale is commercially reasonable (to the extent permitted by applicable law), accept an assignment of any such Collateral in lieu of foreclosure or otherwise act or fail to act with respect to any Collateral securing all or a part of the Guaranteed Obligations, and the Administrative Agent may, at its election, compromise or adjust any part of the Guaranteed Obligations, make any other accommodation with any Obligated Party or exercise any other right or remedy available to it against any Obligated Party, or any security, without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of such Loan Guarantor under this Loan Guaranty except as otherwise provided in Section 10.12.  To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Loan Guarantor waives any defense arising out of any such election even though that election may operate, pursuant to applicable law, to impair or extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of any Loan Guarantor against any Obligated Party or any security.
 
Section 10.05.      Authorization.  The Loan Guarantors authorize the Secured Parties without notice or demand (except as shall be required by applicable statute and cannot be waived), and without affecting or impairing its liability hereunder (except as set f

 claim or cause of action, including a claim of subrogation, contribution or indemnification that it has against any Loan Party in respect of this Loan Guaranty until the occurrence of the Termination Date.
 
Section 10.07.      Reinstatement; Stay of Acceleration.  If at any time any payment of any portion of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, or reorganization of the Borrower or otherwise, each Loan Guarantors obligations under this Loan Guaranty with respect to that payment shall be reinstated at such time as though the payment had not been made.  If acceleration of the time for payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is stayed upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Borrower, all such amounts otherwise subject to acceleration under the terms of any agreement relating to the Guaranteed Obligations shall nonetheless be payable by the other Loan Guarantors forthwith on demand by the Administrative Agent.

Section 10.08.      Information.  Each Loan Guarantor assumes all responsibility for being and keeping itself informed of the Borrowers financial condition and assets, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Guaranteed Obligations and the nature, scope and extent of the risks that each Loan Guarantor assumes and incurs under this Loan Guaranty, and agrees that none of the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any other Secured Party shall have any duty to advise any Loan Guarantor of information known to it regarding those circumstances or risks.
 
Section 10.09.      Maximum Liability.  It is the desire and intent of the Loan Guarantors and the Secured Parties that this Loan Guaranty shall be enforced against the Loan Guarantors to the fullest extent permissible under the laws and public policies applied in each jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought.  The provisions of this Loan Guaranty are severable, and in any action or proceeding involving any state, federal or provincial corporate law, or any state, federal or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other law affecting the rights of creditors generally, if the obligations of any Loan Guarantor under this Loan Guaranty would otherwise be held or determined to be avoidable, invalid or unenforceable on account of the amount of such Loan Guarantors liability under this Loan Guaranty, then, notwithstanding 

her by loan, capital infusion or by other means) to (b) the aggregate Maximum Liability of all Loan Guarantors hereunder (including such Paying Guarantor) as of such date (without giving effect to any right to receive, or obligation to make, any contribution hereunder), or to the extent that a Maximum Liability has not been determined for any Loan Guarantor, the aggregate amount of all monies received by such Loan Guarantors from the Borrower after the Closing Date (whether by loan, capital infusion or by other means).  Nothing in this provision shall affect any Loan Guarantors several liability for the entire amount of the Guaranteed Obligations (up to such Loan Guarantors Maximum Liability).  Each of the Loan Guarantors covenants and agrees that its right to receive any contribution under this Loan Guaranty from a Non-Paying Guarantor shall be subordinate and junior in right of payment to the Secured Obligations until the Termination Date.  This provision is for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the other Secured Parties and may be enforced by any one, or more, or all of them in accordance with the terms hereof.
 
Section 10.11.      Liability Cumulative.  The liability of each Loan Guarantor under this Article 10 is in addition to and shall be cumulative with all liabilities of such Loan Guarantor to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which such Loan Guarantor

is a party or in respect of any obligations or liabilities of the other Loan Guarantors, without any limitation as to amount, unless the instrument or agreement evidencing or creating such other liability specifically provides to the contrary.
 
Section 10.12.      Release of Loan Guarantors.  Notwithstanding anything in Section 9.02(b) to the contrary, a Subsidiary Guarantor shall automatically be released from its obligations hereunder and its Loan Guaranty shall be automatically released (a) upon the consummation of any transaction or related series of transactions permitted hereunder if as a result thereof such Subsidiary Guarantor shall cease to be a Subsidiary (or becomes an Excluded Subsidiary); or (b) upon the occurrence of the Termination Date; provided that, to the extent any Subsidiary became a Subsidiary Guarantor in order to consummate a merger, consolidation or amalgamation permitted under clause (y) (A) of the proviso to Section 6.07(a)(ii), any such release under clause (a) hereof shall constitute an Investment as if such merger, consolidation or amalgamation had been consummated pursuant to clause (y) of the proviso to Section 6.07(a)(ii)(y) as of the date of such release.  In connection with any such release, the Administrative Agent shall promptly execute and deliver to any Loan Guarantor, at such Loan Guarantors expense, all documents that such Loan Guarantor shall reasonably request to evidence termination or release.  Any execution and delivery of documents pursuant to the preceding sentence of this Section 10.12 shall be without recourse to or warranty by the Administrative Agent (other than as to the Administrative Agents authority to execute and deliver such documents).
