greater payment under <u>Sections 3.01</u> or <u>3.04</u>, with respect to any participation, than the Lender from whom it acquired the applicable participation would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a
greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation. Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at the Companys request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate
with the Company to effectuate the provisions of <u>Section</u><u></u><u> 3.06</u> with respect to any Participant. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of

Participants interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the <u>Participant Register</u>); <u>provided</u> that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register
(including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participants interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such
disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under <font style="white-space:nowrap">Section 5f.103-1(c)</font> of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries
in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding
any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register. </p>
