whether the requested Interest Period is acceptable to all of them. In the case of Eurodollar Rate Loans, not later than 11:00 a.m.,
three (3) Business Days before the requested date of such Borrowing, conversion or continuation, Administrative Agent shall notify
Borrower (which notice may be by telephone) whether or not the requested Interest Period has been consented to by all Lenders.
Each telephonic notice by Borrower pursuant to this <u>Section 2.02(a)</u> must be confirmed promptly by delivery (by hand
or facsimile or other electronic transmission, including email) to Administrative Agent of a written Loan Notice, appropriately
completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of Borrower. Each Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate

in a Loan Notice or if Borrower fails to give a timely notice requesting a conversion or continuation, then the applicable Loans
shall be made as, or converted to, Base Rate Loans. Any such automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans shall be effective as of the
last day of the Interest Period then in effect with respect to the applicable Eurodollar Rate Loans. If Borrower requests a Borrowing
of, conversion to, or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans in any such Loan Notice, but fails to specify an Interest Period, it
will be deemed to have specified an Interest Period of one (1) month.</p>

noon on the date of such Borrowing) that such Lender will not make available to Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such

interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to Borrower to but excluding the date
of payment to Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the Federal

Lender shall pay such interest to Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, Administrative Agent shall promptly
remit to Borrower the amount of such interest paid by Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable
Borrowing to Administrative Agent, then the amount of its share of such applicable Borrowing so paid shall constitute such Lender's
Loan included in such Borrowing. Any payment by Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim Borrower may have against a Lender
that shall have failed to make such payment to Administrative Agent.</p>

Base and a Monthly Reduction Amount following receipt by Administrative Agent and Lenders of a Reserve Report and other applicable
information. After having received notice of such proposal from Administrative Agent, all Lenders shall have fifteen (15) days
to agree or disagree with such proposal. At the end of such fifteen (15) day period, all Lenders shall not have communicated their
approval or disapproval, such silence shall be deemed an approval, and Administrative Agent's proposal shall be the new Borrowing
Base and Monthly Reduction Amount. If, however, any Lender notifies Administrative Agent within such fifteen (15) days of its disapproval,
Administrative Agent and all Lenders shall agree on a new Borrowing Base and Monthly Reduction Amount. If all Lenders cannot agree
on the amount of the Borrowing Base or Monthly Reduction Amount, as applicable, within seven (7) days after Administrative Agent
has been notified of their disapproval, then Administrative Agent shall propose a new redetermined Borrowing Base and a new Monthly
Reduction Amount within fifteen (15) days after the end of such seven (7) day period and the foregoing process shall be repeated.
This process shall be repeated until all Lenders agree on a new Borrowing Base and Monthly Reduction Amount. In taking the above
actions, Administrative Agent and Lenders shall act in accordance with their normal and customary procedures for evaluating oil
and gas reserves and other related assets as such exist at that particular time and will otherwise act in their sole discretion.
Further, each Lender may consider such other credit factors as it deems appropriate which are consistent with its normal and customary
procedures for evaluating oil and gas reserves. Without limiting the foregoing, Lenders may exclude any oil and gas reserves or
portion of production therefrom or any income from any other property from the Borrowing Base, at any time, because title information
is not satisfactory or such oil and gas reserves are not Mortgaged Properties.</p>

of any Applicable Usury Laws, or if any transaction contemplated hereby would otherwise be usurious under any Applicable Usury
Laws, then, in that event, regardless of any provision contained in this Agreement or any other Loan Document or other agreement
or instrument executed or delivered in connection herewith, the provisions of this <u>Section 11.09</u> shall govern and control,
and neither Borrower nor any other Person shall be obligated to pay, or apply in any manner to, any amount that would be excessive
interest. Administrative Agent or the Lenders shall never be deemed to have contracted for or be entitled to receive, collect,
charge, reserve or apply as interest on any Loan (whether termed interest therein or deemed to be interest by judicial determination
or operation of law), any amount in excess of the Maximum Amount, and, in the event that Administrative Agent or any of the Lenders
ever receive, collect, or apply as interest any such excess, such amount which would be excessive interest shall be applied as
a partial prepayment of principal and treated hereunder as such, and, if the principal amount of the applicable Loans are paid
in full, any remaining excess shall forthwith be paid to Borrower. In determining whether or not the interest contracted for, received,
collected, charged reserved, paid or payable, including under any specific contingency, exceeds the Maximum Amount, Borrower, Administrative
Agent and the Lenders shall, to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, (i) characterize any non principal payment
(other than payments which are expressly designated as interest payments hereunder) as an expense or fee rather than as interest,
(ii) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effect thereof, and (iii) amortize and spread the total amount of interest
throughout the entire stated term of the Loans so that the interest rate is uniform throughout such term; <i>provided</i> that
if the Loans are paid in full prior to the end of the full contemplated term hereof, and if the interest received for the actual
period of existence thereof exceeds the Maximum Amount, if any, then Administrative Agent or the Lenders shall refund to Borrower
the amount of such excess, or credit the amount of such excess against the aggregate unpaid principal balance of all Loans made
by Administrative Agent or the Lenders. As used herein, the term <b><i>"Maximum Amount"</i></b> means the maximum nonusurious
amount of interest which may be lawfully contracted for, reserved, charged, collected or received by Administrative Agent or such
Lender in connection with the indebtedness evidenced by this Agreement, the Notes and other Loan Documents under all Applicable
Usury Laws. Texas Finance Code, Chapter 346, which regulates certain revolving loan accounts and revolving tri-party accounts,
shall not apply to any revolving loan accounts created under, or apply in any manner to, the Notes, this Agreement or the other
Loan Documents.</p>
