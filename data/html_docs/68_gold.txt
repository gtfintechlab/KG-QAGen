Administrative Agent and its affiliates or other related entities may engage in transactions or other activities that affect any reference rate referred to herein, or any alternative, successor or replacement rate (including any Successor Rate) (or any component of any of the foregoing) or any related spread or other adjustments thereto, in each case, in a manner adverse to Borrower. Administrative Agent may select information sources or services in its reasonable discretion to ascertain any reference rate referred to herein or any alternative, successor or replacement rate (including any Successor Rate) (or any component of any of the foregoing), in each case pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and shall have no liability to Borrower, any Lender or any other​31person or entity for damages of any kind, including direct or indirect, special, punitive, incidental or consequential damages, costs, losses or expenses (whether in tort, contract or otherwise and whether at law or in equity), for any error or other action or omission related to or affecting the selection, determination, or calculation of any rate (or component thereof) provided by any such information source or service.II.THE COMMITMENTS AND CREDIT EXTENSIONS.2.01Loans. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, each Lender severally agrees to make revolving loans to Borrower from time to time, on any Business Day during the Availability Period, in an aggregate amount not to exceed at any time outstanding the amount of such Lender’s Commitment; provided, however, that after giving effect to any Borrowing, (i) the Outstanding Amount of Loans and L/C Obligations shall not exceed the Aggregate Commitments and (ii) the Total Outstandings owed to any Lender shall not exceed such Lender’s Commitment. Within the limits of each Lender’s Commitment, and subject to the other terms and conditions hereof, Borrower may borrow under this Section 2.01, prepay under Section 2.04, and reborrow under this Section 2.01. Loans will be either Term SOFR Rate Loans or Daily SOFR Rate Loans, except as further provided herein.2.02Borrowings, Conversions and Continuations of Loans.(a)Each Borrowing, each conversion of Loans from one Type to the other, and each continuation of Loans shall be made upon Borrower’s irrevocable notice to Administrative Agent, which may be given by (i) telephone, or (ii) a Loan Notice; provided that any telephonic notice must be confirmed promptly by delivery to Administrative Agent of a Loan Notice. Each such Loan Notice must be received by Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. (A) on the date of the request for any Borrowing or continuation of Daily SOFR Rate Loans, (B) two Business Days prior to the requested date of any Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Term SOFR Rate Loans or conversion of Term SOFR Rate Loans to Daily SOFR Rate Loans. Each Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Loans shall be in a principal amount of $1,000,000 or a whole multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof. Unless otherwise specified herein, no conversion from Term SOFR Rate Loans may be made other than at the end of the corresponding Interest Period. Each Loan Notice (whether telephonic or written) shall specify (i) whether Borrower is requesting a Borrowing, a conversion of Loans from one Type to the other, or a continuation of either Term SOFR Rate Loans or Daily SOFR Rate Loans, (ii) the requested date of the Borrowing, conversion or continuation, as the case may be (which shall be a Business Day), (iii) the principal amount of Loans to be borrowed, continued or converted, (iv) the Type of Loans to be borrowed or to which existing Loans are to be converted, and (v) if applicable, the duration of the Interest Period with respect thereto. If Borrower fails to specify Term SOFR in a Loan Notice or if Borrower fails to give a timely notice requesting a conversion or continuation of Term SOFR Rate Loan, then the applicable Loans shall be made as, or converted to, Daily SOFR Rate Loans. Any such automatic conversion to Daily SOFR Rate Loans shall be effective as of the last day of the Interest Period then in effect with respect to the applicable Loans. If Borrower requests a Term SOFR Rate Loan, or a conversion to or continuation of Term SOFR Rate Loans in any such Loan Notice, but fails to specify an Interest Period, it will be deemed to have specified an Interest Period of one month.(b)Following receipt of a Loan Notice, Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the amount of its Applicable Percentage of the applicable Loans. Each Lender shall make the amount of its Loan available to Administrative Agent in immediately available funds at Administrative Agent’s Office not later than 1:00 p.m. on the Business Day specified in the applicable Loan Notice. Upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (and, if such Borrowing is the initial Credit Extension, Section 4.01), Administrative Agent shall make all funds so received available to Borrower in like funds as received by Administrative Agent​32either by (i) crediting the account of Borrower on the books of Bank of America with the amount of such funds or (ii) wire transfer of such funds, in each case in accordance with instructions provided to (and reasonably acceptable to) Administrative Agent by Borrower; provided, however, that if, on the date the Loan Notice with respect to such Borrowing is given by Borrower, there are L/C Borrowings outstanding, then the proceeds of such Borrowing, first, shall be applied to the payment in full of any such L/C Borrowings, and second, shall be made available to Borrower as provided above.(c)Administrative Agent shall promptly notify Borrower and Lenders of the interest rate applicable to each Loan other than Daily SOFR Rate Loans upon determination of same.(d)Without limitation of any other conditions herein, a Borrowing or continuation of or conversion to Term SOFR Rate Loans shall not be permitted if:(i)An Event of Default or a Default has occurred and is continuing and has not been waived by Required Lenders or all Lenders, as applicable; or(ii)After giving effect to the requested Borrowing or continuation of or conversion to Term SOFR Rate Loans, the sum of all Term SOFR Rate Loans plus all other Revolving Credit Exposure would exceed the Aggregate Commitments; or(iii)The requested Borrowing or continuation of or conversion to Term SOFR Rate Loans would cause more than six Interest Periods to be in effect at any one time for Term SOFR Rate Loans, after giving effect to all Term SOFR Rate Loans, all conversions of Loans from one Type to another, and all continuations of Loans as the same Type; or(iv)The amount of Term SOFR Rate Loans requested in the request for Borrowing or continuation of or conversion to Term SOFR Rate Loans is other than $1,000,000 or a whole multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof; or(v)The requested interest period does not conform to the definition of Interest Period herein; or(vi)Any of the circumstances referred to in Section 3.03 shall apply with respect to the requested Borrowing or continuation of or conversion to Term SOFR Rate Loans.(e)With respect to SOFR or Term SOFR, Administrative Agent will have the right to make Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document; provided that, with respect to any such amendment effected, Administrative Agent shall post each such amendment implementing such Conforming Changes to Borrower and the Lenders reasonably promptly after such amendment becomes effective.2.03Letters of Credit.(a)General. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, in addition to the Loans provided for in Section 2.01, Borrower may request any L/C Issuer, in reliance on the agreements of the Lenders set forth in this Section 2.03, to issue, at any time and from time to time during the Availability Period, Letters of Credit denominated in Dollars for its own account or the​33account of any of its Subsidiaries in such form as is acceptable to Administrative Agent and such L/C Issuer in its reasonable determination. Letters of Credit issued hereunder shall constitute utilization of the Commitments.(b)Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Extension, Reinstatement or Renewal. To request the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or the amendment of the terms and conditions, extension of the terms and conditions, extension of the expiration date, or reinstatement of amounts paid, or renewal of an outstanding Letter of Credit), Borrower shall deliver (or transmit by electronic communication, if arrangements for doing so have been approved by the applicable L/C Issuer) to an L/C Issuer and to Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. at least five Business Days (or such other date and time as Administrative Agent and such L/C Issuer may agree in a particular instance in their sole discretion) prior to the proposed issuance date or date of amendment, as the case may be a notice requesting the issuance of a Letter of Credit, or identifying the Letter of Credit to be amended, extended, reinstated or renewed, and specifying the date of issuance, amendment, extension, reinstatement or renewal (which shall be a Business Day), the date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall comply with clause (d) of this Section 2.03), the amount of such Letter of Credit, the name and address of the beneficiary thereof, the purpose and nature of the requested Letter of Credit and such other information as shall be necessary to prepare, amend, extend, reinstate or renew such Letter of Credit. If requested by the applicable L/C Issuer, Borrower also shall submit a letter of credit application and reimbursement agreement on such L/C Issuer’s standard form in connection with any request for a Letter of Credit. In the event of any inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any form of letter of credit application and reimbursement agreement or other agreement submitted by Borrower to, or entered into by Borrower with, an L/C Issuer relating to any Letter of Credit, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control.If Borrower so requests in any applicable Letter of Credit Application (or the amendment of an outstanding Letter of Credit), the applicable L/C Issuer may, in its sole discretion, agree to issue a Letter of Credit that has automatic extension provisions (each, an “Auto-Extension Letter of Credit”); provided that any such Auto-Extension Letter of Credit shall permit such L/C Issuer to prevent any such extension at least once in each twelve-month period (commencing with the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit) by giving prior notice to the beneficiary thereof not later than a day (the “Non-Extension Notice Date”) in each such twelve-month period to be agreed upon by Borrower and the applicable L/C Issuer at the time such Letter of Credit is issued. Unless otherwise directed by the applicable L/C Issuer, Borrower shall not be required to make a specific request to such L/C Issuer for any such extension. Once an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit has been issued, the Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) the applicable L/C Issuer to permit the extension of such Letter of Credit at any time to an expiration date not later than the date permitted pursuant to Section 2.03(d); provided, that such L/C Issuer shall not (i) permit any such extension if (A) such L/C Issuer has determined that it would not be permitted, or would have no obligation, at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its extended form under the terms hereof (except that the expiration date may be extended to a date that is no more than one year from the then-current expiration date) or (B) it has received notice (which may be in writing or by telephone (if promptly confirmed in writing)) on or before the day that is seven Business Days before the Non-Extension Notice Date from Administrative Agent that the Required Lenders have elected not to permit such extension or (ii) be obligated to permit such extension if it has received notice (which may be in writing or by telephone (if promptly confirmed in writing)) on or before the day that is seven Business Days before the Non-Extension Notice Date from Administrative Agent, any Lender or Borrower that one or more of the applicable conditions set forth in Section 4.02 is not then satisfied, and in each such case directing such L/C Issuer not to permit such extension.​34(c)Limitations on Amounts, Issuance and Amendment. A Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended, extended, reinstated or renewed only if (and upon issuance, amendment, extension, reinstatement or renewal of each Letter of Credit Borrower shall be deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, extension, reinstatement or renewal (i) the aggregate amount of the outstanding Letters of Credit issued by any L/C Issuer shall not exceed its L/C Commitment, (ii) the aggregate L/C Obligations shall not exceed the L/C Sublimit, (iii) the Revolving Credit Exposure of any Lender shall not exceed its Commitment and (iv) the total Revolving Credit Exposures shall not exceed the Aggregate Commitments.(i)No L/C Issuer shall be under any obligation to issue any Letter of Credit if:(A)any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain such L/C Issuer from issuing the Letter of Credit, or any Law applicable to such L/C Issuer or any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over such L/C Issuer shall prohibit, or request that such L/C Issuer refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit generally or the Letter of Credit in particular or shall impose upon such L/C Issuer with respect to the Letter of Credit any restriction, reserve or capital requirement (for which such L/C Issuer is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the Closing Date, or shall impose upon such L/C Issuer any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not applicable on the Closing Date and which such L/C Issuer in good faith deems material to it;(B)the issuance of such Letter of Credit would violate one or more policies of such L/C Issuer applicable to letters of credit generally;(C)except as otherwise agreed by Administrative Agent and such L/C Issuer, the Letter of Credit is in an initial stated amount less than $100,000, in the case of a commercial Letter of Credit, or $500,000, in the case of a standby Letter of Credit;(D)any Lender is at that time a Defaulting Lender, unless such L/C Issuer has entered into arrangements, including the delivery of Cash Collateral, satisfactory to such L/C Issuer (in its sole discretion) with Borrower or such Lender to eliminate such L/C Issuer’s actual or potential Fronting Exposure (after giving effect to Section 2.15(a)(iv)) with respect to the Defaulting Lender arising from either the Letter of Credit then proposed to be issued or that Letter of Credit and all other L/C Obligations as to which such L/C Issuer has actual or potential Fronting Exposure, as it may elect in its sole discretion; or(E)the Letter of Credit contains any provisions for automatic reinstatement of the stated amount after any drawing thereunder.(ii)No L/C Issuer shall be under any obligation to amend any Letter of Credit if (A) such L/C Issuer would have no obligation at such time to issue the Letter of Credit in its amended form under the terms hereof, or (B) the beneficiary of the Letter of Credit does not accept the proposed amendment to the Letter of Credit.​35(d)Expiration Date. Each Letter of Credit shall have a stated expiration date no later than the earlier of (i) the date twelve (12) months after the date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any extension of the expiration date thereof, whether automatic or by amendment, twelve (12) months after the then current expiration date of such Letter of Credit) and (ii) the date that is the date that is one year after the Maturity Date then in effect (or, if such day is not a Business Day, the next preceding Business Day), provided that each such Letter of Credit is Cash Collateralized pursuant to Section 2.03(o) at least thirty (30) days prior to the Maturity Date then in effect.(e)Participations. By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount or extending the expiration date thereof), and without any further action on the part of the applicable L/C Issuer or the Lenders, such L/C Issuer hereby grants to each Lender, and each Lender hereby acquires from such L/C Issuer, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lender’s Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this clause (e) in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute, unconditional and irrevocable and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, extension, reinstatement or renewal of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments.In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably agrees to pay to Administrative Agent, for account of the applicable L/C Issuer, such Lender’s Applicable Percentage of each L/C Disbursement made by an L/C Issuer not later than 1:00 p.m. on the Business Day specified in the notice provided by Administrative Agent to the Lenders pursuant to Section 2.03(f) until such L/C Disbursement is reimbursed by Borrower or at any time after any reimbursement payment is required to be refunded to Borrower for any reason, including after the Maturity Date. Such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Each such payment shall be made in the same manner as provided in Section 2.02 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.02 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Lenders), and Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the applicable L/C Issuer the amounts so received by it from the Lenders. Promptly following receipt by Administrative Agent of any payment from Borrower pursuant to Section 2.03(f), Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the applicable L/C Issuer or, to the extent that the Lenders have made payments pursuant to this clause (e) to reimburse such L/C Issuer, then to such Lenders and such L/C Issuer as their interests may appear. Any payment made by a Lender pursuant to this clause (e) to reimburse an L/C Issuer for any L/C Disbursement shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such L/C Disbursement.Each Lender further acknowledges and agrees that its participation in each Letter of Credit will be automatically adjusted to reflect such Lender’s Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit at each time such Lender’s Commitment is amended pursuant to the operation of Section 2.13, as a result of an assignment in accordance with Section 10.06 or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement.If any Lender fails to make available to Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable L/C Issuer any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.03(e), then, without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, the applicable L/C Issuer shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to such L/C​36Issuer at a rate per annum equal to the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the applicable L/C Issuer in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by such L/C Issuer in connection with the foregoing. If such Lender pays such amount (with interest and fees as aforesaid), the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender’s Loan included in the relevant Borrowing or L/C Advance in respect of the relevant L/C Borrowing, as the case may be. A certificate of any L/C Issuer submitted to any Lender (through Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause shall be conclusive absent manifest error.(f)Reimbursement. If an L/C Issuer shall make any L/C Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, Borrower shall reimburse such L/C Issuer in respect of such L/C Disbursement by paying to Administrative Agent an amount equal to such L/C Disbursement not later than 12:00 noon on (i) the Business Day that Borrower receives notice of such L/C Disbursement, if such notice is received prior to 10:00 a.m. or (ii) the Business Day immediately following the day that Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is not received prior to such time, provided that, if such L/C Disbursement is not less than $1,000,000, Borrower may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Section 2.02 that such payment be financed with a Borrowing of Daily SOFR Rate Loans in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so financed, Borrower’s obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting Borrowing of Daily SOFR Rate Loans. If Borrower fails to make such payment when due, Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the applicable L/C Disbursement, the payment then due from Borrower in respect thereof (the “Unreimbursed Amount”) and such Lender’s Applicable Percentage thereof. In such event, Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a Borrowing of Daily SOFR Rate Loans to be disbursed on the date of payment by the applicable L/C Issuer under a Letter of Credit in an amount equal to the Unreimbursed Amount, without regard to the minimum and multiples specified in Section 2.02 for the principal amount of Daily SOFR Rate Loans, but subject to the amount of the unutilized portion of the Aggregate Commitments and the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (other than the delivery of a Loan Notice). Any notice given by any L/C Issuer or Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 2.03(f) may be given by telephone if immediately confirmed in writing; provided that the lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice.(g)Obligations Absolute. Borrower’s obligation to reimburse L/C Disbursements as provided in clause (f) of this Section 2.03 shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of:(i)any lack of validity or enforceability of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any Letter of Credit, or any term or provision herein or therein;(ii)the existence of any claim, counterclaim, setoff, defense or other right that Borrower or any Subsidiary may have at any time against any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), any L/C Issuer or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or by such Letter of Credit or any agreement or instrument relating thereto, or any unrelated transaction;(iii)any draft, demand, certificate or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement in such draft or other document being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; or any​37loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under such Letter of Credit;(iv)waiver by any L/C Issuer of any requirement that exists for such L/C Issuer’s protection and not the protection of Borrower or any waiver by such L/C Issuer which does not in fact materially prejudice Borrower;(v)honor of a demand for payment presented electronically even if such Letter of Credit required that demand be in the form of a draft;(vi)any payment made by any L/C Issuer in respect of an otherwise complying item presented after the date specified as the expiration date of, or the date by which documents must be received under such Letter of Credit if presentation after such date is required by the UCC, the ISP or the UCP, as applicable;(vii)payment by the applicable L/C Issuer under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply strictly with the terms of such Letter of Credit; or any payment made by any L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit to any Person purporting to be a trustee in bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidator, receiver or other representative of or successor to any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit, including any arising in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law; or(viii)any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section 2.03, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, Borrower’s obligations hereunder.Borrower shall promptly examine a copy of each Letter of Credit and each amendment thereto that is delivered to it and, in the event of any claim of noncompliance with Borrower’s instructions or other irregularity, Borrower will immediately notify the applicable L/C Issuer. Borrower shall be conclusively deemed to have waived any such claim against each L/C Issuer and its correspondents unless such notice is given as aforesaid.None of Administrative Agent, the Lenders, any L/C Issuer, or any of their Related Parties shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit by the applicable L/C Issuer or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms, any error in translation or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the applicable L/C Issuer; provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse an L/C Issuer from liability to Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable Law) suffered by Borrower that are caused by such L/C Issuer’s failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of an L/C Issuer (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), an L/C Issuer shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination, and that:​38(i)an L/C Issuer may replace a purportedly lost, stolen, or destroyed original Letter of Credit or missing amendment thereto with a certified true copy marked as such or waive a requirement for its presentation;(ii)an L/C Issuer may accept documents that appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and may make payment upon presentation of documents that appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit and without regard to any non-documentary condition in such Letter of Credit;(iii)an L/C Issuer shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to decline to accept such documents and to make such payment if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit; and(iv)this sentence shall establish the standard of care to be exercised by an L/C Issuer when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof (and the parties hereto hereby waive, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, any standard of care inconsistent with the foregoing).Without limiting the foregoing, none of Administrative Agent, the Lenders, any L/C Issuer, or any of their Related Parties shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of (i) any presentation that includes forged or fraudulent documents or that is otherwise affected by the fraudulent, bad faith, or illegal conduct of the beneficiary or other Person, (ii) an L/C Issuer declining to take-up documents and make payment (A) against documents that are fraudulent, forged, or for other reasons by which that it is entitled not to honor or (B) following a Borrower’s waiver of discrepancies with respect to such documents or request for honor of such documents or (iii) an L/C Issuer retaining proceeds of a Letter of Credit based on an apparently applicable attachment order, blocking regulation, or third-party claim notified to such L/C Issuer.(h)Applicability of ISP and UCP; Limitation of Liability. Unless otherwise expressly agreed by the applicable L/C Issuer and Borrower when a Letter of Credit is issued by it, (i) the rules of the ISP shall apply to each standby Letter of Credit, and (ii) the rules of the UCP shall apply to each commercial Letter of Credit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no L/C Issuer shall be responsible to Borrower for, and no L/C Issuer’s rights and remedies against Borrower shall be impaired by, any action or inaction of any L/C Issuer required or permitted under any law, order, or practice that is required or permitted to be applied to any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, including the Law or any order of a jurisdiction where any L/C Issuer or the beneficiary is located, the practice stated in the ISP or UCP, as applicable, or in the decisions, opinions, practice statements, or official commentary of the ICC Banking Commission, the Bankers Association for Finance and Trade - International Financial Services Association (BAFT-IFSA), or the Institute of International Banking Law & Practice, whether or not any Letter of Credit chooses such law or practice.(i)each L/C Issuer shall act on behalf of the Lenders with respect to any Letters of Credit issued by it and the documents associated therewith, and each L/C Issuer shall have all of the benefits and immunities (A) provided to Administrative Agent in Article IX with respect to any acts taken or omissions suffered by such L/C Issuer in connection with Letters of Credit issued by it or proposed to be issued by it and Issuer Documents pertaining to such Letters of Credit as fully as if the term “Administrative Agent” as used in Article IX included such L/C Issuer with respect to such acts or omissions, and (B) as additionally provided herein with respect to such L/C Issuer.​39(j)Letter of Credit Fees. Borrower shall pay to Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender in accordance, subject to Section 2.15, with its Applicable Percentage a Letter of Credit fee (the “Letter of Credit Fee”) for each Letter of Credit equal to the Applicable Rate times the daily amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. For purposes of computing the daily amount available to be drawn under any Letter of Credit, the amount of such Letter of Credit shall be determined in accordance with Section 1.06. Letter of Credit Fees shall be (i) due and payable on the first Business Day after the end of each March, June, September and December, commencing with the first such date to occur after the issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the Maturity Date and thereafter on demand and (ii) computed on a quarterly basis in arrears. If there is any change in the Applicable Rate during any quarter, the daily amount available to be drawn under each Letter of Credit shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Rate separately for each period during such quarter that such Applicable Rate was in effect. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, upon the request of the Required Lenders, while any Event of Default exists, all Letter of Credit Fees shall accrue at the Default Rate.(k)Fronting Fee and Documentary and Processing Charges Payable to L/C Issuers. Borrower shall pay directly to the applicable L/C Issuer for its own account a fronting fee with respect to each Letter of Credit equal to the greater of (A) $1,500 per Letter of Credit on the date of issuance of the applicable Letter of Credit and, if applicable, each renewal date for such Letter of Credit and (B) 0.125% per annum of the issued and undrawn amount of such Letter of Credit, computed on the daily amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit on a quarterly basis in arrears. Such fronting fee shall be due and payable on the tenth Business Day after the end of each March, June, September and December in respect of the most recently-ended quarterly period (or portion thereof, in the case of the first payment), commencing with the first such date to occur after the issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the date on which such Letter of Credit expires in accordance with the terms hereof and thereafter on demand. For purposes of computing the daily amount available to be drawn under any Letter of Credit, the amount of such Letter of Credit shall be determined in accordance with Section 1.06. In addition, Borrower shall pay directly to the applicable L/C Issuer for its own account the customary issuance, presentation, amendment and other processing fees, and other standard costs and charges, of such L/C Issuer relating to letters of credit as from time to time in effect. Such customary fees and standard costs and charges are due and payable on demand and are nonrefundable.(l)Disbursement Procedures. The applicable L/C Issuer for any Letter of Credit shall, within the time allowed by applicable Laws or the specific terms of the Letter of Credit following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under such Letter of Credit. such L/C Issuer shall promptly after such examination notify Administrative Agent and Borrower in writing of such demand for payment if such L/C Issuer has made or will make an L/C Disbursement thereunder; provided that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such L/C Issuer and the Lenders with respect to any such L/C Disbursement.(m)Interim Interest. If the applicable L/C Issuer for any Letter of Credit shall make any L/C Disbursement, then, unless Borrower shall reimburse or a loan shall be made to reimburse such L/C Disbursement in full on the date such L/C Disbursement is made or the next date as provided above, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such L/C Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that Borrower reimburses such L/C Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to Daily SOFR Rate Loans; provided that if Borrower fails to reimburse such L/C Disbursement when due pursuant to clause (f) of this Section 2.03, then Section 2.07(b) shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this clause (m) shall be for account of such L/C Issuer, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any​40Lender pursuant to clause (f) of this Section 2.03 to reimburse such L/C Issuer shall be for account of such Lender to the extent of such payment.(n)Replacement of any L/C Issuer. Any L/C Issuer may be replaced at any time by written agreement between Borrower, Administrative Agent, the replaced L/C Issuer and the successor L/C Issuer. Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of an L/C Issuer. At the time any such replacement shall become effective, Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.03(j). From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i) the successor L/C Issuer shall have all the rights and obligations of an L/C Issuer under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued by it thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term “L/C Issuer” shall be deemed to include such successor or any previous L/C Issuer, or such successor and all previous L/C Issuer, as the context shall require. After the replacement of an L/C Issuer hereunder, the replaced L/C Issuer shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an L/C Issuer under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit.(o)Cash Collateralization. If any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, on the Business Day that Borrower receives notice from Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, Lenders with L/C Obligations representing at least 66-2/3% of the total L/C Obligations) demanding the deposit of cash collateral pursuant to this clause (o), Borrower shall immediately deposit into an account established and maintained on the books and records of Administrative Agent (the “Collateral Account”) an amount in cash equal to 105% of the total L/C Obligations as of such date, provided that the obligation to deposit such cash collateral shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to Borrower described in clause (f) of Section 8.01. Such deposit shall be held by Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the obligations of Borrower under this Agreement. In addition, and without limiting the foregoing or clause (d) of this Section 2.03, if any L/C Obligations remain outstanding after the expiration date specified in said clause (d), Borrower shall immediately deposit into the Collateral Account an amount in cash equal to 105% of such L/C Obligations as of such date; provided that Borrower shall Cash Collateralize each Letter of Credit that has an expiration date beyond the Maturity Date at least thirty (30) days prior to the Maturity Date.Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over the Collateral Account. Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of Administrative Agent and at Borrower’s risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in the Collateral Account. Moneys in the Collateral Account shall be applied by Administrative Agent to reimburse each L/C Issuer for L/C Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed, together with related fees, costs, and customary processing charges, and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of Borrower for the L/C Obligations at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of Lenders with L/C Obligations representing 66-2/3% of the total L/C Obligations), be applied to satisfy other obligations of Borrower under this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.03. If Borrower is required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to Borrower within three Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured or waived.​41(p)Letters of Credit Issued for Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding that a Letter of Credit issued or outstanding hereunder is in support of any obligations of, or is for the account of, a Subsidiary, Borrower shall be obligated to reimburse, indemnify and compensate the applicable L/C Issuer hereunder for any and all drawings under such Letter of Credit as if such Letter of Credit had been issued solely for the account of Borrower. Borrower irrevocably waives any and all defenses that might otherwise be available to it as a guarantor or surety of any or all of the obligations of such Subsidiary in respect of such Letter of Credit. Borrower hereby acknowledges that the issuance of Letters of Credit for the account of Subsidiaries inures to the benefit of Borrower, and that Borrower’s business derives substantial benefits from the businesses of such Subsidiaries.(q)Conflict with Issuer Documents. In the event of any conflict between the terms hereof and the terms of any Issuer Document, the terms hereof shall control.2.04Prepayments.(a)Borrower may, upon delivery of a Notice of Prepayment to Administrative Agent, at any time or from time to time voluntarily prepay Loans in whole or in part without premium or penalty; provided that (i) such Notice of Prepayment must be received by Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. (A) two Business Days prior to any date of prepayment of Term SOFR Rate Loans, (B) one Business Day prior to any date of prepayment of Daily SOFR Rate Loans and (C) on the date of prepayment of Base Rate Loans; (ii) any prepayment of Term SOFR Rate Loans or Daily SOFR Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of $1,000,000 or a whole multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof; and (iii) any prepayment of Base Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of $500,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof or, in each case, the entire principal amount thereof then outstanding. Each such notice shall specify the date and amount of such prepayment. Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Lender of its receipt of each such notice, and of the amount of such Lender’s ratable portion of such prepayment (based on such Lender’s Applicable Percentage). If such notice is given by Borrower, Borrower shall make such prepayment and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein. Any prepayment of a Loan shall be accompanied by all accrued interest on the amount prepaid, together with, in the case of any Term SOFR Rate Loan or Daily SOFR Rate Loan, any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.05, if any. Subject to Section 2.15, each such prepayment shall be applied to the Loans of the Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages.(b)If for any reason the Total Outstandings at any time exceed the Aggregate Commitments then in effect, Borrower shall immediately upon demand prepay Loans and/or Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations in an aggregate amount equal to such excess; provided, however, that Borrower shall not be required to Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations pursuant to this Section 2.04(b) unless after the prepayment in full of the Loans the Total Outstandings exceed the Aggregate Commitments then in effect.2.05Termination or Reduction of Commitments. Borrower may, upon notice to Administrative Agent, terminate the Aggregate Commitments, or from time to time permanently reduce the Aggregate Commitments; provided that (i) any such notice shall be received by Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. three Business Days prior to the date of termination or reduction, (ii) any such partial reduction shall be in an aggregate amount of $5,000,000 or any whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, and (iii) Borrower shall not terminate or reduce the Aggregate Commitments if, after giving effect thereto and to any concurrent prepayments hereunder, the Total Outstandings would exceed the Aggregate Commitments. Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Lenders of any such notice of termination or​42reduction of the Aggregate Commitments. Any reduction of the Aggregate Commitments shall be applied to the Commitment of each Lender according to its Applicable Percentage. All fees accrued until the effective date of any termination of the Aggregate Commitments shall be paid on the effective date of such termination.2.06Repayment of Loans.(a)Borrower shall repay to the Lenders on the Maturity Date the aggregate principal amount of Loans outstanding on such date.(b)Borrower shall Fully Satisfy all other Obligations (to the extent not specified in subsection 2.06(a) above) on or prior to the earlier of (i) the date on which payment of such Obligations are required to be paid pursuant to the terms hereof or of the other Loan Documents, and (ii) the later of the Maturity Date; provided, however, that L/C Obligations that have been fully Cash Collateralized as of the date that is thirty (30) days prior to the Letter of Credit Issuance Expiration Date in accordance with Section 2.14(a) may remain outstanding for a period of up to twelve (12) months following the Maturity Date (subject to the earlier expiration of such L/C Obligations pursuant to the terms of the applicable Letter of Credit).2.07Interest.(a)Subject to the provisions of subsection (b) below, (i) each Daily SOFR Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof at a rate per annum equal to Daily Simple SOFR plus the Applicable Rate for Daily SOFR Rate Loans; (ii) each Term SOFR Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof at a rate per annum equal to Term SOFR for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Rate for Term SOFR Rate Loans; and (iii) each Base Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate for Base Rate Loans.(b)(i)If any amount of principal of any Loan is not paid within five days after the date when due (other than at the Maturity Date, whether at stated maturity or by acceleration, as to which such five day period shall not apply), such amount shall thereafter bear interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the applicable Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws.(ii)If any amount (other than principal of any Loan) payable by Borrower under any Loan Document is not paid within five days after the date when due (other than at the Maturity Date, whether at stated maturity or by acceleration, as to which such five day period shall not apply), then upon the request of the Required Lenders, such amount shall thereafter bear interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the applicable Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws.(iii)Upon the request of the Required Lenders, while any Event of Default exists, Borrower shall pay interest on the principal amount of all outstanding Obligations hereunder at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the applicable Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws.(iv)Accrued and unpaid interest on past due amounts (including interest on past due interest) shall be due and payable upon demand.​43(c)Interest on each Loan shall be due and payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date applicable thereto and at such other times as may be specified herein. Interest hereunder shall be due and payable in accordance with the terms hereof before and after judgment, and before and after the commencement of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law.2.08Fees. In addition to certain fees described in subsections (j) and (k) of Section 2.03:(a)Facility Fee. Borrower shall pay to Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender in accordance with its Applicable Percentage, a facility fee (the “Facility Fee”) equal to the applicable facility fee percentage identified in the definition of Applicable Rate for Loans per annum times the actual daily amount of the Aggregate Commitments (or, if the Aggregate Commitments have terminated, on the Outstanding Amount of all Loans and L/C Obligations), regardless of usage, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 2.15. The Facility Fee shall accrue at all times during the Availability Period (and thereafter so long as any Loans or L/C Obligations remain outstanding), including at any time during which one or more of the conditions in Article IV is not met, and shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December, commencing with the first such date to occur after the Closing Date, and on the last day of the Availability Period (and, if applicable, thereafter on demand). The Facility Fee shall be calculated quarterly in arrears, and if there is any change in the Applicable Rate during any quarter, the actual daily amount shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Rate separately for each period during such quarter that such Applicable Rate was in effect.(b)Other Fees.(i)Without duplication of the requirements hereof, Borrower shall pay to Administrative Agent, and BofA Securities, for their own respective account fees in the amounts and at the times specified in the Fee Letters. Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever unless mutually agreed by the parties to the Fee Letters.(ii)Borrower shall pay to the Lenders such fees as shall have been separately agreed upon in writing (and approved by BofA Securities and Administrative Agent) in the amounts and at the times so specified. Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever.2.09Computation of Interest and Fees; Retroactive Adjustments of Applicable Rate.(a)All computations of interest for Base Rate Loans (including Base Rate Loans determined by reference to Term SOFR) shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed. All other computations of fees and interest shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed (which results in more fees or interest, as applicable, being paid than if computed on the basis of a 365-day year). Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion is paid, provided that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall, subject to Section 2.11(a), bear interest for one day. Each determination by Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.(b)If, as a result of any restatement of or other adjustment to the financial statements of Borrower or for any other reason, Borrower or the Lenders determine that (i) the Leverage Ratio​44as calculated by Borrower as of any applicable date was inaccurate and (ii) a proper calculation of the Leverage Ratio would have resulted in higher pricing for such period, Borrower shall immediately and retroactively be obligated to pay to Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Lenders or the applicable L/C Issuer, as the case may be, promptly on demand by Administrative Agent (or, after the occurrence of an actual or deemed entry of an order for relief with respect to Borrower under the Bankruptcy Code of the United States, automatically and without further action by Administrative Agent, any Lender or any L/C Issuer), an amount equal to the excess of the amount of interest and fees that should have been paid for such period over the amount of interest and fees actually paid for such period. This clause (b) shall not limit the rights of Administrative Agent, any Lender or any L/C Issuer, as the case may be, under Section 2.03(c), 2.03(h) or 2.07(b) or under Article VIII. Borrower’s obligations under this clause (b) shall survive the termination of the Aggregate Commitments and the repayment of all other Obligations hereunder2.10Evidence of Debt.(a)The Credit Extensions made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of business. The accounts or records maintained by Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of the Credit Extensions made by the Lenders to Borrower and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. Upon the request of any Lender made through Administrative Agent, Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through Administrative Agent) a Note, which shall evidence such Lender’s Loans in addition to such accounts or records. Each Lender may attach schedules to its Note and endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto.(b)In addition to the accounts and records referred to in subsection (a), each Lender and Administrative Agent shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice accounts or records evidencing the purchases and sales by such Lender of participations in Letters of Credit. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by Administrative Agent and the accounts and records of any Lender in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error.2.11Payments Generally; Administrative Agent’s Clawback.(a)General. All payments to be made by Borrower shall be made without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by Borrower hereunder shall be made to Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at Administrative Agent’s Office in Dollars and in immediately available funds not later than 1:00 p.m. on the date specified herein. Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Applicable Percentage (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender’s Lending Office and if such payments by Borrower are made to Administrative Agent by 1:00 p.m., Administrative Agent will distribute such funds to Lenders specified in this Section 2.11(a) on that same Business Day. All payments received by Administrative Agent after 1:00 p.m. shall be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day (and shall be distributed​45to the Lenders in accordance with this Section 2.11(a) on such next succeeding Business Day) and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue. If any payment to be made by Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be.(b)(i)Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent. Unless Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing of Loans that such Lender will not make available to Administrative Agent such Lender’s share of such Borrowing, Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with Section 2.02 and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and Borrower severally agree to pay to Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing, and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Daily SOFR Rate Loans. If Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to Borrower the amount of such interest paid by Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender’s Loan included in such Borrowing. Any payment by Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to Administrative Agent.(ii)Payments by Borrower; Presumptions by Administrative Agent. Unless Administrative Agent shall have received notice from Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or any L/C Issuer hereunder that Borrower will not make such payment, Administrative Agent may assume that Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the applicable L/C Issuers, as the case may be, the amount due.With respect to any payment that Administrative Agent makes for the account of the Lenders or any L/C Issuer hereunder as to which Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that any of the following applies (such payment referred to as the “Rescindable Amount”): (1) Borrower has not in fact made such payment; (2) Administrative Agent has made a payment in excess of the amount so paid by Borrower (whether or not then owed); or (3) Administrative Agent has for any reason otherwise erroneously made such payment; then each of the Lenders or the applicable L/C Issuer, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the Rescindable Amount so distributed to such Lender or such L/C Issuer, in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.​46A notice of Administrative Agent to any Lender or Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this subsection (b) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error(c)Failure to Satisfy Conditions Precedent. If any Lender makes available to Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this Article II, and such funds are not made available to Borrower by Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable Credit Extension set forth in Article IV are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, Administrative Agent shall promptly return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest.(d)Obligations of Lenders Several. The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Loans, to fund participations in Letters of Credit and to make payments pursuant to Section 10.04(c) are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan, to fund any such participation or to make any payment under Section 10.04(c) on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan, to purchase its participation or to make its payment under Section 10.04(c).(e)Funding Source. Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner.2.12Sharing of Payments by Lenders. If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of the Loans made by it, or the participations in L/C Obligations held by it resulting in such Lender’s receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of such Loans or participations and accrued interest thereon greater than its pro rata share thereof as provided herein, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and subparticipations in L/C Obligations of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and other amounts owing them, provided that:(i)if any such participations or subparticipations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations or subparticipations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and(ii)the provisions of this Section shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by or on behalf of Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender), (y) the application of Cash Collateral provided for in Section 2.14, or (z) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or subparticipations in L/C Obligations to any assignee or participant, other than an assignment to Borrower or any Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this Section shall apply).Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable Law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of Borrower in the amount of such participation.​472.13Increase in Commitments.(a)Request for Increase. Provided there exists no Default, upon notice to Administrative Agent (which shall promptly notify the Lenders), Borrower may from time to time request an increase in the Aggregate Commitments to an amount not exceeding $750,000,000 in the aggregate; provided that (I) any such request for an increase shall be in a minimum amount of $20,000,000 (or such lesser amount as approved by Administrative Agent), and (II) Borrower may make a maximum of three such requests. Any increases to the Aggregate Commitments may take the form of an increase in the Commitments or an addition of one or more additional revolving or new term loan tranches with a maturity date occurring on or after the Maturity Date and not requiring principal amortization prior to the Maturity Date, in which case such additional tranches shall constitute new commitments and loans hereunder (and the definitions of “Commitments” and “Loans” shall be amended accordingly). At the time of sending such notice, Borrower (in consultation with Administrative Agent) shall specify the time period within which each Lender is requested to respond (which shall in no event be less than ten Business Days from the date of delivery of such notice to the Lenders). Any increase of the Aggregate Commitments pursuant to this Section 2.13 shall be subject to the agreement of one or more Lenders or Eligible Assignees (who may or may not then be a Lender hereunder) to provide such increased Commitments pursuant to the terms hereof.(b)Lender Elections to Increase. Each Lender shall notify Administrative Agent within such time period whether or not it agrees to increase its Commitment and, if so, whether by an amount equal to, greater than, or less than its Applicable Percentage of such requested increase. Any Lender not responding within such time period shall be deemed to have declined to increase its Commitment.(c)Notification by Administrative Agent; Additional Lenders. Administrative Agent shall notify Borrower and each Lender of the Lenders’ responses to each request made hereunder. To achieve the full amount of a requested increase and subject to the approval of Administrative Agent and each L/C Issuer (which approvals shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), Borrower and/or BofA Securities may also invite additional Eligible Assignees to become Lenders pursuant to a joinder agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Borrower, Administrative Agent and their respective counsel. Arrangers shall use their best efforts to procure such additional or increased Commitments, and facilitate such increase in the Aggregate Commitments, and Borrower shall reasonably cooperate with Arrangers to obtain new Commitments to support any such increase in the Aggregate Commitments, provided that Borrower will coordinate all such efforts (including, without limitation, any communications (written, electronic or oral) with any prospective lending source) through Arrangers. In no event shall any Lender be obligated to provide an additional Commitment.(d)Effective Date and Allocations. If the Aggregate Commitments are increased in accordance with this Section, Administrative Agent and Borrower shall determine the effective date (the “Increase Effective Date”) and the final allocation of such increase. Administrative Agent shall promptly notify Borrower and the Lenders of the final allocation of such increase and the Increase Effective Date.(e)Conditions to Effectiveness of Increase. As a condition precedent to such increase, (i) Borrower shall deliver to Administrative Agent a certificate of Borrower dated as of the Increase Effective Date (in sufficient copies for each Lender) signed by a Responsible Officer (A) certifying and attaching the resolutions adopted by Borrower approving or consenting to such increase, and (B) certifying that, before and after giving effect to such increase, (1) the​48representations and warranties contained in Article V and the other Loan Documents are true and correct in all material respects on and as of the Increase Effective Date, except (x) to the extent that such representations and warranties specifically refer to an earlier date, in which case they are true and correct in all material respects as of such earlier date, and (y) except that for purposes of this Section 2.13, (I) the representations and warranties contained in subsections (a), (b) and (c) of Section 5.05 shall be deemed to refer to the most recent statements furnished pursuant to clauses (a) and (b), respectively, of Section 6.01; and (II) the representations and warranties contained in Section 5.13(a) shall be deemed to refer to the most recent update to Schedule 5.13(a) furnished pursuant to Section 6.02(a)(ii) and shall be true and correct in all material respects as of the effective date of such update, (2) the representations and warranties contained in the first and second sentences of Section 5.21 shall be deemed to refer to the most recent update to Schedule 5.21 furnished pursuant to Section 6.02(a)(i), and shall be true and correct in all material respects as of the effective date of such update, and (3) no Default or Event of Default exists, and (ii)(x) upon the reasonable request of any Lender made at least five days prior to the Increase Effective Date, Borrower shall have provided to such Lender, and such Lender shall be reasonably satisfied with, the documentation and other information so requested in connection with applicable “know your customer” and anti-money-laundering rules and regulations, including, without limitation, the PATRIOT Act, in each case at least five days prior to the Increase Effective Date and (y) at least five days prior to the Increase Effective Date, any Loan Party that qualifies as a “legal entity customer” under the Beneficial Ownership Regulation shall have delivered, to each Lender that so requests, a Beneficial Ownership Certification in relation to such Loan Party. The Applicable Percentages of the Lenders shall be recalculated concurrently with the effectiveness of any increase in the Aggregate Commitments pursuant to this Section 2.13.(f)Conflicting Provisions. This Section shall supersede any provisions in Section 10.01 to the contrary. Without limiting the foregoing, an increase in Aggregate Commitments pursuant to this Section 2.13 and any amendments to this Agreement made to evidence such increase shall not require the consent of any Lender not participating in such increase.2.14Cash Collateral.(a)Obligation to Cash Collateralize. At any time that there shall exist a Defaulting Lender, within one Business Day following the written request of Administrative Agent or any L/C Issuer (with a copy to Administrative Agent), Borrower shall Cash Collateralize the L/C Issuers’ Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender (determined after giving effect to Section 2.15(a)(iv) and any Cash Collateral provided by such Defaulting Lender) in an amount not less than the Minimum Collateral Amount.(b)Grant of Security Interest. Borrower, and to the extent provided by any Defaulting Lender, such Defaulting Lender, hereby grants to (and subjects to the control of) Administrative Agent, for the benefit of Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuers and the Lenders, and agrees to maintain, a first priority security interest in all such cash, deposit accounts and all balances therein, and all other property so provided as collateral pursuant hereto, and in all proceeds of the foregoing, all as security for the obligations to which such Cash Collateral may be applied pursuant to Section 2.14(c). If at any time Administrative Agent determines that Cash Collateral is subject to any right or claim of any Person other than Administrative Agent or the applicable L/C Issuer as herein provided, or that the total amount of such Cash Collateral is less than the Minimum Collateral Amount, Borrower will, promptly upon demand by Administrative Agent, pay or provide to Administrative Agent additional Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to eliminate such deficiency (determined in the case of Cash Collateral provided pursuant to clause (a) above, after​49giving effect to Section 2.15(a)(iv) and any Cash Collateral provided by the Defaulting Lender). All Cash Collateral (other than credit support not constituting funds subject to deposit) shall be maintained in one or more Controlled Accounts at Bank of America. Borrower shall pay on demand therefor from time to time all customary account opening, activity and other administrative fees and charges in connection with the maintenance and disbursement of Cash Collateral.(c)Application. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Cash Collateral provided under any of this Section 2.14(c) or Sections 2.03, 2.15 or 8.02 in respect of Letters of Credit shall be held and applied to the satisfaction of the specific L/C Obligations, obligations to fund participations therein (including, as to Cash Collateral provided by a Defaulting Lender, any interest accrued on such obligation) and other obligations for which the Cash Collateral was so provided, prior to any other application of such property as may otherwise be provided for herein.(d)Release. Cash Collateral (or the appropriate portion thereof) provided to reduce Fronting Exposure or to secure other obligations shall be released promptly following (i) the elimination of the applicable Fronting Exposure or other obligations giving rise thereto (including by the termination of Defaulting Lender status of the applicable Lender (or, as appropriate, its assignee following compliance with Section 10.06(b)(vi))) or (ii) the determination by Administrative Agent and the applicable L/C Issuer that there exists excess Cash Collateral; provided, however, the Person providing Cash Collateral and the applicable L/C Issuer may agree that Cash Collateral shall not be released but instead held to support future anticipated Fronting Exposure or other obligations.2.15Defaulting Lenders.(a)Adjustments. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as that Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable Law:(i)Waivers and Amendments. Such Defaulting Lender’s right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in the definition of “Required Lenders” and Section 10.01.(ii)Defaulting Lender Waterfall. Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Article VIII or otherwise) or received by Administrative Agent from a Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 10.08 shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by Administrative Agent as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to Administrative Agent hereunder; second, to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to any L/C Issuer hereunder; third, to Cash Collateralize the L/C Issuers’ Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender in accordance with Section 2.14; fourth, as Borrower may request (so long as no Default or Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by Administrative Agent; fifth, if so determined by Administrative Agent and Borrower, to be held in a deposit account and released pro rata in order to (x) satisfy such Defaulting Lender’s potential future funding obligations with respect to Loans under this Agreement and (y) Cash Collateralize the L/C Issuers’ future Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender with respect to future Letters of Credit issued under this Agreement, in​50accordance with Section 2.14; sixth, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders or the L/C Issuers as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender or any L/C Issuer against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; seventh, so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and eighth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans or L/C Borrowings in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share, and (y) such Loans were made or the related Letters of Credit were issued at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of, and L/C Obligations owed to, all Non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of, or L/C Obligations owed to, such Defaulting Lender until such time as all Loans and funded and unfunded participations in L/C Obligations are held by the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the Commitments hereunder without giving effect to Section 2.15(a)(iv). Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section 2.15(a)(ii) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.(iii)Certain Fees.(A)Each Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive fees payable under Section 2.08(a) for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender only to extent allocable to the sum of (1) the outstanding principal amount of the Loans funded by it, and (2) its Applicable Percentage of the stated amount of Letters of Credit for which it has provided Cash Collateral pursuant to Section 2.14.(B)Each Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive Letter of Credit Fees for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender only to the extent allocable to its Applicable Percentage of the stated amount of Letters of Credit for which it has provided Cash Collateral pursuant to Section 2.14.(C)With respect to any fee payable under Section 2.08(a) or any Letter of Credit Fee not required to be paid to any Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (A) or (B) above, Borrower shall (x) pay to each Non-Defaulting Lender that portion of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender with respect to such Defaulting Lender’s participation in L/C Obligations that has been reallocated to such Non-Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (iv) below, (y) pay to each L/C Issuer the amount of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender to the extent allocable to such L/C Issuer’s Fronting Exposure to such Defaulting Lender, and (z) not be required to pay the remaining amount of any such fee.(iv)Reallocation of Applicable Percentages to Reduce Fronting Exposure. All or any part of such Defaulting Lender’s participation in L/C Obligations shall be reallocated among the Non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective​51Applicable Percentages (calculated without regard to such Defaulting Lender’s Commitment) but only to the extent that such reallocation does not cause the aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure of any Non-Defaulting Lender to exceed such Non-Defaulting Lender’s Commitment. Subject to Section 10.20, no reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a Non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such Non-Defaulting Lender’s increased exposure following such reallocation.(v)Cash Collateral. If the reallocation described in clause (a)(iv) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, Borrower shall, without prejudice to any right or remedy available to it hereunder or under applicable Law, Cash Collateralize the L/C Issuers’ Fronting Exposure in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.14.(b)Defaulting Lender Cure. If Borrower, Administrative Agent, each L/C Issuer agree in writing that a Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any Cash Collateral), that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit to be held pro rata by the Lenders in accordance with the Commitments (without giving effect to Section 2.15(a)(iv)), whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender’s having been a Defaulting Lender.(c)New Letters of Credit. So long as any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, no L/C Issuer shall be required to issue, extend, increase, reinstate or renew any Letter of Credit unless it is satisfied that it will have no Fronting Exposure after giving effect thereto.2.16Extension of Maturity Date.(a)Borrower may, by notice to Administrative Agent from time to time request an extension (each, an “Extension”) of the Maturity Date for all or a portion of the Loans and Commitments be extended to the extended maturity date specified in such notice. Such notice shall set forth the date on which such Extension is requested to become effective (which shall be not less than thirty (30) days nor more than sixty (60) days after the date of such Extension notice (or, at the request of Borrower, such longer or shorter periods as Administrative Agent shall agree in its sole discretion)). Each Lender shall be offered (an “Extension Offer”) an opportunity to participate in such Extension on a pro rata basis and on the same terms and conditions as each other Lender pursuant to procedures established by, or reasonably acceptable to, Administrative Agent and Borrower and such Extension Offer shall specify the time period within which each Lender is requested to respond (which shall in no event be less than ten Business Days from the date of delivery of such notice to the Lenders); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to accept any Extension Offer and any failure by a Lender to respond to an Extension Offer shall be deemed to be a rejection of such Extension Offer. If Lenders holding Commitments that equal or exceed the amount requested to be extended in the relevant Extension Offer shall have accepted such Extension Offer (each such accepting Lender, an “Extending Lender”), then the Maturity Date for​52the Extending Lenders shall be extended as set forth in such Extension Offer.  If the aggregate principal amount of Commitments in respect of which Extending Lenders shall have accepted the relevant Extension Offer shall exceed the maximum aggregate principal amount of Commitments subject to the Extension Offer as set forth in the Extension notice, then the Commitments of Extending Lenders shall be extended ratably up to such maximum amount based on the respective principal amounts with respect to which such Extending Lenders have accepted such Extension Offer. In the event of such extension, the Commitment of each Non-Extending Lender (as defined below) shall terminate on the existing Maturity Date in effect for such Non-Extending Lender prior to such extension and the outstanding principal balance of all Loans and other amounts payable hereunder to such Non-Extending Lender shall become due and payable on such existing Maturity Date and, subject to Section 2.16(c) below, the Aggregate Commitments hereunder shall be reduced by the Commitments of the Non-Extending Lenders so terminated on such existing Maturity Date.(b)The following shall be conditions precedent to the effectiveness of any Extension: (i) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing immediately prior to and after giving effect to such Extension, (ii) the representations and warranties of Borrower set forth in Article V and in each other Loan Document shall be deemed to be made and shall be true and correct in all material respects on and as of the effective date of such Extension, except (w) to the extent that such representations and warranties are already qualified by materiality, in which case they are true and correct in all respects, (x) to the extent that such representations and warranties specifically refer to an earlier date, in which case they are true and correct in all material respects as of such earlier date, and (y) that (I) the representations and warranties contained in subsections (a), (b) and (c) of Section 5.05 shall be deemed to refer to the most recent statements furnished pursuant to clauses (a) and (b), respectively, of Section 6.01; and (II) the representations and warranties contained in Section 5.13 shall be deemed to refer to the most recent update to Schedule 5.13 furnished pursuant to Section 6.02(a)(ii), and (III) the representations and warranties contained in the first and second sentences of Section 5.21 shall be deemed to refer to the most recent update to Schedule 5.21 furnished pursuant to Section 6.02(a)(i), (iii) the applicable L/C Issuers shall have consented to any Extension, to the extent that such Extension provides for the issuance or extension of Letters of Credit issued by such L/C Issuer at any time during the extended period, and (iv) the terms of such Extended Revolving Credit Commitments shall comply with clause (d) of this Section 2.16.(c)Borrower shall have the right to replace each Lender that determines not to so extend its Maturity Date (a “Non-Extending Lender”) with, and add as a Lender under this Agreement in place thereof, one or more Eligible Assignees (each, an “Additional Commitment Lender”) as provided in Section 10.13; provided that each of such Additional Commitment Lenders shall enter into an Assignment and Assumption (or a joinder agreement, Commitment increase agreement or other similar agreement, as applicable) pursuant to which such Additional Commitment Lender shall, effective as of the Maturity Date, undertake a Commitment (and, if any such Additional Commitment Lender is already a Lender, its Commitment shall be in addition to any other Commitment of such Lender hereunder on such date).(d)The terms of each Extension shall be determined by Administrative Agent, Borrower and the applicable Extending Lenders and set forth in an amendment to this Agreement (an “Extension Amendment”); provided that (i) the final maturity date of any Extended Revolving Credit Commitment shall be no earlier than the existing Maturity Date, (ii) there shall be no scheduled amortization of the loans or scheduled reductions of commitments under any Extended Revolving Credit Commitments, (iii) the existing Loans will not be contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Extended Revolving Loan Commitments, and the borrower and guarantors​53(if any) of the Extended Revolving Credit Commitments shall be the same as Borrower and guarantors (if any) with respect to the existing Loans, (iv) the interest rate margin, rate floors, fees, and premium applicable to any Extended Revolving Credit Commitment (and the Extended Revolving Loans thereunder) from and after the Maturity Date of non-extended Commitments shall be determined by Borrower and the applicable Extending Lenders, (v) prepayment of Extended Revolving Loans, or reductions of Extended Revolving Credit Commitments, and participation in Letters of Credit, shall be on a pro rata basis with the other Loans or Commitments (other than upon the maturity of the non-extended Loans and Commitments) and (vi) the terms of the Extended Revolving Credit Commitments shall be substantially identical to the terms set forth herein (except as set forth in clauses (i) through (v) above).(e)In connection with any Extension, Borrower, Administrative Agent and each applicable Extending Lender shall execute and deliver to Administrative Agent an Extension Amendment and such other documentation as Administrative Agent shall reasonably specify to evidence the Extension. Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender as to the effectiveness of each Extension. Any Extension Amendment may, without the consent of any other Lender, effect such amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the reasonable opinion of Administrative Agent and Borrower, to implement the terms of any such Extension, including any amendments necessary to establish Extended Revolving Credit Commitments as a new tranche of Commitments or Loans, as applicable, and such other technical amendments as may be necessary or appropriate in the reasonable opinion of Administrative Agent and Borrower in connection with the establishment of such new tranche (including to preserve the pro rata treatment of the extended and non-extended tranches and to provide for the reallocation of Revolving Credit Exposure upon the expiration or termination of the commitments under any tranche), in each case on terms consistent with this Section 2.16. This Section 2.16 shall supersede any provisions in Section or 10.01 to the contrary.III.TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY.3.01Taxes; Defined Terms. For purposes of this Section 3.01, the term “Applicable Law” includes FATCA.(a)Payments Free of Taxes. Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by Applicable Law. If any Applicable Law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable Withholding Agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a Withholding Agent, then the applicable Withholding Agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with Applicable Law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 3.01) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made.(b)Payment of Other Taxes by Borrower. Borrower shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with Applicable Law, or at the option of Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes.(c)Indemnification by Borrower. Borrower shall indemnify each Recipient, within 10 days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified​54Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 3.01) payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to Administrative Agent), or by Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.(d)Indemnification by the Lenders. Each Lender shall severally indemnify Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that Borrower has not already indemnified Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of Borrower to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 10.06(d) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to Administrative Agent under this clause (d).(e)Evidence of Payments. As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by Borrower to a Governmental Authority as provided in this Section 3.01, Borrower shall deliver to Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of any return required by Laws to report such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to Administrative Agent.(f)Status of Lenders; Tax Documentation.(i)Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to Borrower and Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by Borrower or Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by Borrower or Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by Borrower or Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by Borrower or Administrative Agent as will enable Borrower or Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 3.01(f)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.​55(ii)Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that Borrower is a U.S. Person,(A)any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to Borrower and Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of Borrower or Administrative Agent), executed copies of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax;(B)any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to Borrower and Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of Borrower or Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:(1)in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or W-8BEN, as applicable) establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “interest” article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or W-8BEN, as applicable) establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “business profits” or “other income” article of such tax treaty;(2)executed copies of IRS Form W-8ECI;(3)in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a “10 percent shareholder” of Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a “controlled foreign corporation” described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a “U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate”) and (y) executed copies of IRS Form W 8BEN E (or W-8BEN, as applicable); or(4)to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed copies of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W 8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or W-8BEN, as applicable), a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-2 or Exhibit H-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner;​56(C)any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to Borrower and Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of Borrower or Administrative Agent), executed copies of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit Borrower or Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and(D)if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to Borrower and Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by Borrower or Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by Borrower or Administrative Agent as may be necessary for Borrower and Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (D), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.(iii)Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered pursuant to this Section 3.01 expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify Borrower and Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.(g)Treatment of Certain Refunds. Unless required by applicable Laws, at no time shall Administrative Agent have any obligation to file for or otherwise pursue on behalf of a Lender or an L/C Issuer, or have any obligation to pay to any Lender or any L/C Issuer, any refund of Taxes withheld or deducted from funds paid for the account of such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be. If any Recipient determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by Borrower or with respect to which Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 3.01, it shall pay to Borrower an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by Borrower under this Section 3.01 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) incurred by such Recipient, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund), provided that Borrower, upon the request of the Recipient, agrees to repay the amount paid over to Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Recipient in the event the Recipient is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this clause (g), in no event will the applicable Recipient be required to pay any amount to Borrower pursuant to this clause (g) the payment of which would place the Recipient in a less favorable net after-Tax position than such Recipient would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the​57indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This subsection shall not be construed to require any Recipient to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to Borrower or any other Person.(h)Survival. Each party’s obligations under this Section 3.01 shall survive the resignation or replacement of Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender or an L/C Issuer, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other Obligations.3.02Illegality. If any Lender reasonably determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to SOFR, Term SOFR, or Daily Simple SOFR, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon SOFR, Term SOFR or Daily Simple SOFR, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to engage in reverse repurchase of U.S. Treasury securities transactions of the type included in the determination of SOFR, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to Borrower through Administrative Agent, (a) any obligation of such Lender to make or continue either Term SOFR Rate Loans or Daily SOFR Rate Loans affected thereby shall be suspended and (b) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or maintaining Base Rate Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the Term SOFR component of the Base Rate, the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by Administrative Agent without reference to the Term SOFR component of the Base Rate, in each case until such Lender notifies Administrative Agent and Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, (i) Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all affected Term SOFR Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by Administrative Agent without reference to the Term SOFR component of the Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Term SOFR Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Term SOFR Rate Loans, (ii) Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to Administrative Agent), immediately prepay or, if applicable, convert all affected Daily SOFR Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by Administrative Agent without reference to the Term SOFR component of the Base Rate), and (iii) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon SOFR, Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the Term SOFR component thereof until Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon SOFR. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.05.3.03Inability to Determine Rates.(a)If in connection with any request for a Term SOFR Rate Loan, or Daily SOFR Rate Loan, or a conversion of Daily SOFR Rate Loans to Term SOFR Rate Loans or a continuation of any of such advances, as applicable, (a) Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that (i) no Successor Rate has been determined in accordance with Section 3.03(b), and the circumstances under Section 3.03(b)(i) or the Scheduled Unavailability Date has occurred, or (ii) adequate and reasonable means do not otherwise exist for determining Term SOFR for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Term SOFR Rate Loan or in connection with an existing or proposed Base Rate Loan, or (iii) adequate and​58reasonable means do not otherwise exist for determining Daily Simple SOFR in connection with an existing or proposed Daily SOFR Rate Loan, or (b) Administrative Agent or Required Lenders determine that for any reason that Term SOFR for any requested Interest Period or Daily Simple SOFR with respect to a proposed advance does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such advance, Administrative Agent will promptly so notify Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, (x) the obligation of Lenders to make or maintain Term SOFR Rate Loans, Daily SOFR Rate Loans, or to convert Daily SOFR Rate Loans to Term SOFR Rate Loans, shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected Term SOFR Rate Loans, Daily SOFR Rate Loans, or Interest Periods), and (y) in the event of a determination described in the preceding sentence with respect to the Term SOFR component of the Base Rate, the utilization of the Term SOFR component in determining the Base Rate shall be suspended, in each case until Administrative Agent (or, in the case of a determination by Required Lenders described in Section 3.03(b), until Administrative Agent upon instruction of Required Lenders) revokes such notice.

For the avoidance of doubt, any such proposed rate and adjustments, shall constitute a “Successor Rate”. Any such amendment shall become effective at 5:00 p.m. on the fifth (5th) Business Day after Administrative Agent shall have posted such proposed amendment to all Lenders and Borrower unless, prior to such time, Lenders comprising the Required Lenders have delivered to Administrative Agent written notice that such Required Lenders object to such amendment.Administrative Agent will promptly (in one or more notices) notify Borrower and each Lender of the implementation of any Successor Rate.Any Successor Rate shall be applied in a manner consistent with market practice; provided that to the extent such market practice is not administratively feasible for Administrative Agent, such Successor Rate shall be applied in a manner as otherwise reasonably determined by Administrative Agent.Notwithstanding anything else herein, if at any time any Successor Rate as so determined would otherwise be less than zero percent (0.0%), the Successor Rate will be deemed to be zero percent (0.0%) for the purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.In connection with the implementation of a Successor Rate, Administrative Agent will have the right to make Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement; provided that, with respect to any such amendment effected, Administrative Agent shall post each such amendment implementing such Conforming Changes to Borrower and the Lenders reasonably promptly after such amendment becomes effective.​603.04Increased Costs.(a)Increased Costs Generally.

Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or any L/C Issuer to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s or such L/C Issuer’s right to demand such compensation, provided that Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or an L/C Issuer pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine (9) months prior to the date that such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be, notifies Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender’s or such L/C Issuer’s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).3.05Compensation for Losses. Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to Administrative Agent) from time to time, Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of:(a)any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan bearing interest at Term SOFR on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise);(b)any failure by Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Loan on the date or in the amount notified by Borrower; or(c)any assignment of Loans bearing interest at Term SOFR other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by Borrower pursuant to Section 10.13;including any loss of anticipated profits and any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan bearing interest at Term SOFR or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained.

Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, Borrower or Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural person, a Defaulting Lender or Borrower or any of Borrower’s Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a “Participant”) in all or a portion of such Lender’s rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans (including such Lender’s participations in L/C Obligations) owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) Borrower, Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuers shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement.Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in the lettered items of the first proviso to Section 10.01 that affects such Participant. Subject to subsection (e) of this Section, Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01 (subject to the requirements and limitations therein, including the requirements under Section 3.01(f)), 3.04 and 3.05 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.08 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.12 as though it were a Lender.Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant’s interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the “Participant Register”); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant’s interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.(e)Limitations upon Participant Rights. A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 3.01 or 3.04 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.01 unless Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of Borrower, to comply with Section 3.01(e) as though it were a Lender.​99(f)Certain Pledges. Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.(g)Resignation as L/C Issuer after Assignment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if at any time any L/C Issuer assigns all of its Commitment and Loans pursuant to subsection (b) above, such L/C Issuer may, upon thirty (30) days’ notice to Borrower and the Lenders, resign as an L/C Issuer. In the event of any such resignation as an L/C Issuer, Borrower shall be entitled to appoint from among the Lenders a successor L/C Issuer hereunder; provided, however, that no failure by Borrower to appoint any such successor shall affect the resignation of such L/C Issuer as an L/C Issuer. If any L/C Issuer resigns as an L/C Issuer, it shall retain all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of an L/C Issuer hereunder with respect to all Letters of Credit outstanding as of the effective date of its resignation as an L/C Issuer and all L/C Obligations with respect thereto (including the right to require the Lenders to make Daily SOFR Rate Loans or fund risk participations in Unreimbursed Amounts pursuant to Section 2.03(f)). Upon the appointment of a successor L/C Issuer, (a) such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring L/C Issuer and (b) the successor L/C Issuer shall issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession or make other arrangements satisfactory to such L/C Issuer to effectively assume the obligations of such L/C Issuer with respect to such Letters of Credit.10.07Treatment of Certain Information; Confidentiality. Each of Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuers agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its Affiliates and to its and its Affiliates’ respective partners, directors, officers, employees, agents, trustees, advisors and representatives SOLELY IN CONNECTION WITH THIS Agreement and the Loan Documents (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority purporting to have jurisdiction over it (including any self-regulatory authority, such as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners), (c) to the extent required by applicable Laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to any other party hereto, (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or under any other Loan Document or any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section, to (i) any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or any Eligible Assignee invited to be a Lender pursuant to Section 2.13(c) or (ii) any actual or prospective counterparty (or its advisors) to any swap or derivative transaction relating to Borrower and its obligations, (g) with the consent of Borrower or (h) to the extent such Information (x) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section or (y) becomes available to Administrative Agent, any Lender, any L/C Issuer or any of their respective Affiliates on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than Borrower. For purposes of this Section, “Information” means all information received from Borrower or any Subsidiary relating to Borrower or any Subsidiary or any of their respective businesses, other than any such information that is available to Administrative Agent, any Lender or any L/C Issuer on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by Borrower or any Subsidiary, provided that, in the case of information received from Borrower or any Subsidiary after the date hereof, all such information shall be deemed to be confidential unless Borrower or such Subsidiary has clearly and conspicuously marked such information as “PUBLIC” in accordance with Section 6.02. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its​100obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information.Each of Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuers acknowledges that (a) the Information may include material non-public information concerning Borrower or a Subsidiary, as the case may be, (b) it has developed compliance procedures regarding the use of material non-public information and (c) it will handle such material non-public information in accordance with applicable Law, including United States federal and state securities Laws.10.08Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender, each L/C Issuer and each of their respective Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, after obtaining the prior written consent of Administrative Agent, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, in whatever currency) at any time held and other obligations (in whatever currency) at any time owing by such Lender, such L/C Issuer or any such Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of Borrower against any and all of the obligations of Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Agreement or any other Loan Document to such Lender or such L/C Issuer, irrespective of whether or not such Lender or such L/C Issuer shall have made any demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and although such obligations of Borrower may be contingent or unmatured or are owed to a branch or office of such Lender or such L/C Issuer different from the branch or office holding such deposit or obligated on such indebtedness; provided, that in the event that any Defaulting Lender shall exercise any such right of setoff, (x) all amounts so set off shall be paid over immediately to Administrative Agent for further application in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.15 and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and (y) the Defaulting Lender shall provide promptly to Administrative Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the Obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as to which it exercised such right of setoff. The rights of each Lender, each L/C Issuer and their respective Affiliates under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that such Lender, such L/C Issuer or their respective Affiliates may have. Each Lender each the L/C Issuer agrees to notify Borrower and Administrative Agent promptly after any such setoff and application, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application.10.09Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid under the Loan Documents shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious interest permitted by applicable Law (the “Maximum Rate”). If Administrative Agent or any Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to Borrower. In determining whether the interest contracted for, charged, or received by Administrative Agent or a Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the Obligations hereunder.10.10Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto in different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement and the other Loan Documents constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. Except as provided in Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by Administrative Agent and when Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof that, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto. Delivery of an​101executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by telecopy or other electronic imaging means shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.10.11Survival of Representations and Warranties. All representations and warranties made hereunder and in any other Loan Document or other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and thereof. Such representations and warranties have been or will be relied upon by Administrative Agent and each Lender, regardless of any investigation made by Administrative Agent or any Lender or on their behalf and notwithstanding that Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default at the time of any Credit Extension, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as any Loan or any other Obligation hereunder shall remain unpaid or unsatisfied or any Letter of Credit shall remain outstanding.10.12Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, (a) the legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall not be affected or impaired thereby and (b) the parties shall endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions. The invalidity of a provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this Section 10.12, if and to the extent that the enforceability of any provisions in this Agreement relating to Defaulting Lenders shall be limited by Debtor Relief Laws, as determined in good faith by Administrative Agent or each L/C Issuer, as applicable, then such provisions shall be deemed to be in effect only to the extent not so limited.10.13Replacement of Lenders. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.04, or if Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.01, or if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, or if a Lender is a Non-Extending Lender, or if any other circumstance exists hereunder that gives Borrower the right to replace a Lender as a party hereto, then Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 10.06), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment), provided that:(a)Borrower shall have paid to Administrative Agent the assignment fee specified in Section 10.06(b);(b)such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to 100% of the outstanding principal of its Loans and L/C Advances, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under Section 3.05) from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or Borrower (in the case of all other amounts);(c)in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 3.04 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 3.01, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter; and(d)such assignment does not conflict with applicable Laws.​102A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.10.14Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Etc.(a)GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK PURSUANT TO SECTION 5-1401 OF THE GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK (WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO NEW YORK’S PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW).(b)SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION.

BORROWER IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY OBJECTION THAT IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT IN ANY COURT REFERRED TO IN PARAGRAPH (b) OF THIS SECTION. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE DEFENSE OF AN INCONVENIENT FORUM TO THE MAINTENANCE OF SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN ANY SUCH COURT.(d)SERVICE OF PROCESS.

NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT WILL AFFECT THE RIGHT OF ANY PARTY HERETO TO SERVE PROCESS IN ANY OTHER MANNER PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.10.15Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO​103A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY).

Each of the Loan Parties agrees that any Electronic Signature on or associated with any Communication shall be valid and binding on each such Loan Party to the same extent as a manual, original signature, and that any Communication entered into by Electronic Signature, will constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation of such Loan Party, enforceable against such Loan Party in accordance with the terms thereof to the same extent as if a manually executed original signature was delivered or a paper-based recordkeeping system was used, as the case may be. Any Communication may be executed in as many counterparts as necessary or convenient, including both paper and electronic counterparts, but all such counterparts are one and the same Communication. For the avoidance of doubt, the authorization under this paragraph may include, without limitation, use or acceptance by Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders of a manually signed paper Communication which has been converted into electronic form (such as scanned into PDF format), or an electronically signed Communication converted into another format, for transmission, delivery and/or retention.

All Communications in the form of an Electronic Record, including an Electronic Copy, shall be considered an original for all purposes, and shall have the same legal effect, validity and enforceability as a paper record. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, Administrative Agent is under no obligation to accept an Electronic Signature in any form or in any format unless expressly agreed to by Administrative Agent pursuant to procedures approved by it; provided, further, without limiting the foregoing, (i) to the extent Administrative Agent has agreed to accept such Electronic Signature, Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders shall be entitled to rely on any such Electronic Signature purportedly given by or on behalf of any Loan Party without further verification and (ii) upon the request of Administrative Agent or any Lender, any Electronic Signature shall be promptly followed by such manually executed counterpart.

To the extent that this Agreement or any other Loan Document provide support, through a guarantee or otherwise, for any Swap Contract or any other agreement

ll be effective to the same extent as the transfer would be effective under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support (and any such interest, obligation and rights in property) were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. In the event a Covered Party or a BHC Act Affiliate of a Covered Party becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, Default Rights under the Loan Documents that might otherwise apply to such Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support that may be exercised against such Covered Party are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such Default Rights could be exercised under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and the Loan Documents were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. Without limitation of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that rights and remedies of the parties with respect to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event affect the rights of any Covered Party with respect to a Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support.(b)As used in this Section 10.21, the following terms have the following meanings:“BHC Act Affiliate” of a party means an “affiliate” (as such term is defined under, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 U.S.C. 1841(k)) of such party.​106“Covered Entity” means any of the following: (i) a “covered entity” as that term is defined in, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R. § 252.82(b); (ii) a “covered bank” as that term is defined in, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R. § 47.3(b); or (iii) a “covered FSI” as that term is defined in, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R. § 382.2(b).“Default Right” has the meaning assigned to that term in, and shall be interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R. §§ 252.81, 47.2 or 382.1, as applicable.“QFC” has the meaning assigned to the term “qualified financial contract” in, and shall be interpreted in accordance with, 12 U.S.C. 5390(c)(8)(D).10.22ENTIRE AGREEMENT. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS REPRESENT THE FINAL AGREEMENT AMONG THE PARTIES AND MAY NOT BE CONTRADICTED BY EVIDENCE OF PRIOR, CONTEMPORANEOUS, OR SUBSEQUENT ORAL AGREEMENTS OF THE PARTIES.

To the extent that the withholding or deduction is made on account of Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the Guarantor shall be increased in accordance with Section 3.01 of the Agreement so that after any required withholding or deduction the Lender receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such withholding or deduction for Indemnified Taxes been made. The obligations of the Guarantor under this paragraph shall survive the payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations and termination of this Guaranty.3.Rights of Lender. The Guarantor consents and agrees that the Lender may, at any time and from time to time, without notice or demand, and without affecting the enforceability or continuing effectiveness hereof: (a) amend, extend, renew, compromise, discharge, accelerate or otherwise change the time for payment or the terms of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof; (b) take, hold, exchange, enforce, waive, release, fail to perfect, sell, or otherwise dispose of any security for the payment of this Guaranty or any Guaranteed Obligations; (c) apply such security and direct the order or manner of sale thereof as the Lender in its sole discretion may determine; and (d) release or substitute one or more of any endorsers or other guarantors of any of the Guaranteed Obligations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Guarantor consents to the taking of, or failure to take, any action which might in any manner or to any extent vary the risks of the Guarantor under this Guaranty or which, but for this provision, might operate as a discharge of the Guarantor.4.Certain Waivers. The Guarantor waives to the fullest extent permitted by law (a) any defense arising by reason of any disability or other defense of Borrower or any other guarantor, or the cessation from any cause whatsoever (including any act or omission of the Lender) of the liability of Borrower; (b) any defense based on any claim that the Guarantor’s obligations exceed or are more burdensome than those of Borrower; (c) the benefit of any statute of limitations affecting the Guarantor’s liability hereunder; (d) any right to require the Lender to proceed against Borrower, proceed against or exhaust any security for the Guaranteed Obligations, or pursue any other remedy in the Lender ‘s power whatsoever and any defense based upon the doctrines of marshalling of assets or of election of remedies; (e) any benefit of and any right to participate in any security now or hereafter held by the Lender; (f) any fact or circumstance related to the Guaranteed Obligations which might otherwise constitute a defense to the obligations of the Guarantor under this Guaranty and (g) any and all other defenses or benefits that may be derived from or afforded by applicable law limiting the liability of or exonerating guarantors or sureties, other than the defense that the Guaranteed Obligations have been fully performed and indefeasibly paid in full in cash.The Guarantor expressly waives all presentments, demands for payment or performance, notices of nonpayment or nonperformance, protests, notices of protest, notices of dishonor and all other notices or demands of any kind or nature whatsoever with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations, and all notices of acceptance of this Guaranty or of the existence, creation or incurrence of new or additional Guaranteed Obligations. This Guaranty shall not be affected by the genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of the Guaranteed Obligations or any instrument or agreement evidencing any Guaranteed Obligations, or by the existence, validity, enforceability, perfection, non-perfection or extent of any collateral therefor, or by any fact or circumstance relating to the Guaranteed Obligations which might otherwise constitute a defense to the obligations of the Guarantor under this Guaranty, and the Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any defenses it may now have or hereafter acquire in any way relating to any or all of the foregoing.5.Obligations Independent. The obligations of the Guarantor hereunder are those of primary obligor, and not merely as surety, and are independent of the Guaranteed Obligations and the obligations of any other guarantor, and a separate action may be brought against the Guarantor to enforce this Guaranty whether or not Borrower or any other person or entity is joined as a party.​Exhibit F - Page 26.Subrogation. The Guarantor shall not exercise any right of subrogation, contribution, indemnity, reimbursement or similar rights with respect to any payments it makes under this Guaranty until all of the Guaranteed Obligations and any amounts payable under this Guaranty have been indefeasibly paid and performed in full and any commitments of the Lender or facilities provided by the Lender with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations are terminated. If any amounts are paid to the Guarantor in violation of the foregoing limitation, then such amounts shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Lender and shall forthwith be paid to the Lender to reduce the amount of the Guaranteed Obligations, whether matured or unmatured.7.Termination; Reinstatement. This Guaranty is a continuing and irrevocable guaranty of all Guaranteed Obligations now or hereafter existing and shall, unless earlier released in accordance with the Agreement, remain in full force and effect until all Guaranteed Obligations and any other amounts payable under this Guaranty are indefeasibly paid in full in cash and any commitments of the Lender or facilities provided by the Lender with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations are terminated. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Guaranty shall continue in full force and effect or be revived, as the case may be, if any payment by or on behalf of Borrower or the Guarantor is made, or the Lender exercises its right of setoff, in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations and such payment or the proceeds of such setoff or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Lender in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Laws or otherwise, all as if such payment had not been made or such setoff had not occurred and whether or not the Lender is in possession of or has released this Guaranty and regardless of any prior revocation, rescission, termination or reduction. The obligations of the Guarantor under this paragraph shall survive termination of this Guaranty.8.Subordination. The Guarantor hereby subordinates the payment of all obligations and indebtedness of Borrower owing to the Guarantor, whether now existing or hereafter arising, including but not limited to any obligation of Borrower to the Guarantor as subrogee of the Lender or resulting from the Guarantor’s performance under this Guaranty, to the indefeasible payment in full in cash of all Guaranteed Obligations. During the continuance of an Event of Default under the Agreement, any such obligation or indebtedness of Borrower to the Guarantor shall be enforced and performance received by the Guarantor as trustee for the Lender and the proceeds thereof shall be paid over to the Lender on account of the Guaranteed Obligations, but without reducing or affecting in any manner the liability of the Guarantor under this Guaranty.9.Stay of Acceleration. In the event that acceleration of the time for payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is stayed, in connection with any case commenced by or against the Guarantor or Borrower under any Debtor Relief Laws, or otherwise, all such amounts shall nonetheless be payable by the Guarantor immediately upon demand by the Lender.10.Expenses. The Guarantor shall pay on demand all out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses) in any way relating to the enforcement or protection of the Lender’s rights under this Guaranty or in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations, including any incurred during any “workout” or restructuring in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations and any incurred in the preservation, protection or enforcement of any rights of the Lender in any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Laws. The obligations of the Guarantor under this paragraph shall survive the payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations and termination of this Guaranty.11.Miscellaneous. The Lender’s books and records showing the amount of the Guaranteed Obligations shall be admissible in evidence in any action or proceeding, and shall be binding upon the Guarantor and conclusive, absent manifest error, for the purpose of establishing the amount of the​Exhibit F - Page 3Guaranteed Obligations. No provision of this Guaranty may be waived, amended, supplemented or modified, except by a written instrument executed by Administrative Agent (with approval of the Required Lenders) and the Guarantor. No failure by the Lender to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, remedy or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy or power hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy. The remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law or in equity. The unenforceability or invalidity of any provision of this Guaranty shall not affect the enforceability or validity of any other provision herein. Unless otherwise agreed by the Lender and the Guarantor in writing, this Guaranty is not intended to supersede or otherwise affect any other guaranty now or hereafter given by the Guarantor for the benefit of the Lender or any term or provision thereof. Capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have the meaning ascribed to such terms in the Agreement.12.Condition of Borrower. The Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that it has the sole responsibility for, and has adequate means of, obtaining from Borrower and any other guarantor such information concerning the financial condition, business and operations of Borrower and any such other guarantor as the Guarantor requires, and that the Lender has no duty, and the Guarantor is not relying on the Lender at any time, to disclose to the Guarantor any information relating to the business, operations or financial condition of Borrower or any other guarantor (the guarantor waiving any duty on the part of the Lender to disclose such information and any defense relating to the failure to provide the same).13.Setoff. If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and if and to the extent any payment is not made when due hereunder, the Lender may setoff and charge from time to time any amount so due against any or all of the Guarantor’s accounts or deposits with the Lender.14.Representations and Warranties. The Guarantor represents and warrants that (a) it is organized and resident in the United States of America; (b) it is duly organized and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization and has full capacity and right to make and perform this Guaranty, and all necessary authority has been obtained; (c) this Guaranty constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation enforceable in accordance with its terms; (d) the making, existence, and performance of this Guaranty does not and will not violate the provisions of any applicable law, regulation or order, and does not and will not result in the breach of, or constitute a default or require any consent under, any material agreement, instrument, or document to which it is a party or by which it or any of its property may be bound or affected; and (e) all consents, approvals, licenses and authorizations of, and filings and registrations with, any governmental authority required under applicable law and regulations for the making and performance of this Guaranty have been obtained or made and are in full force and effect.15.GOVERNING LAW; Assignment; Jurisdiction; Notices. THIS GUARANTY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. This Guaranty shall (a) bind the Guarantor and its successors and assigns, provided that the Guarantor may not assign its rights or obligations under this Guaranty without the prior written consent of the Lender (and any attempted assignment without such consent shall be void), and (b) inure to the benefit of the Lender and its successors and permitted assigns under the Agreement. The Guarantor hereby irrevocably (i) submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any United States Federal or State court sitting in the State of New York, City of New York in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Guaranty, and (ii) waives to the fullest extent permitted by law any defense asserting an inconvenient forum in connection therewith. Service of process by the Lender in connection with such action or proceeding shall be binding on the Guarantor if sent to the Guarantor by registered or certified mail at its address specified below or such other address as from time to time notified by the Guarantor. The Guarantor agrees that, subject to the Section 10.07 of the Agreement, the Lender may disclose to any assignee of or participant in, or any prospective assignee of or participant in, any of its rights or obligations​Exhibit F - Page 4of all or part of the Guaranteed Obligations, any and all information in the Lender’s possession concerning the Guarantor this Guaranty and any security for this Guaranty. All notices and other communications to the Guarantor under this Guaranty shall be in writing and shall be delivered by hand or overnight courier service, mailed by certified or registered mail or sent by telecopier to the Guarantor at its address set forth below or at such other address in the United States as may be specified by the Guarantor in a written notice delivered to the Lender at such office as the Lender may designate for such purpose from time to time in a written notice to the Guarantor.16.WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL; FINAL AGREEMENT. TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE GUARANTOR AND THE LENDER EACH IRREVOCABLY WAIVES TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY ACTION, CLAIM, SUIT OR PROCEEDING ON, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS GUARANTY OR THE GUARANTEED OBLIGATIONS. THIS GUARANTY REPRESENTS THE FINAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND MAY NOT BE CONTRADICTED BY EVIDENCE OF PRIOR, CONTEMPORANEOUS, OR SUBSEQUENT ORAL AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE PARTIES.
