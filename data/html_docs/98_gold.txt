Lender and L/C Issuer.  The Borrower has requested that the Lenders provide the credit facility set forth herein, and the Lenders are
willing to do so on the terms and conditions set forth herein.  In consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements herein contained,

transactions, of either (a) all or any substantial portion of the property of, or a line of business or division of, another Person or (b) at least a majority of the voting stock of another Person, in each case whether or not involving a
merger or consolidation with such other Person.  Administrative Agent means Bank of America in its capacity as
administrative agent under any of the Loan Documents, or any successor administrative agent.  Administrative Agents
Office means the Administrative Agents address and, as appropriate, account as set forth on Schedule 10.02, or such other address or account as the Administrative Agent may from time to time notify to the Borrower and the

Administrative Agent.  Affiliate means, with respect to any Person, another Person that directly, or indirectly through
one or more intermediaries, Controls or is Controlled by or is under common Control with the Person specified.  Aggregate
Revolving Commitments means the Revolving Commitments of all the Lenders. The aggregate principal amount of the Aggregate Revolving Commitments in effect on the Closing Date is TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION and No/100 DOLLARS

Applicable Percentage means, with respect to each Lender, the percentage (carried out to the ninth decimal place) of the
Aggregate Revolving Commitments represented by such Lenders Revolving Commitment at such time; provided that if the commitment of each Lender to make Revolving Loans and the obligation of the L/C Issuer to make L/C Credit Extensions has been
terminated pursuant to Section 8.02 or if the Aggregate Revolving Commitments have expired or been terminated pursuant to Section 2.06, then the Applicable Percentage of each Lender shall be determined based on the Applicable




Percentage of such Lender most recently in effect, giving effect to any subsequent assignments. The Applicable Percentage of each Lender, after giving effect to this Agreement (along with any
amendments made hereto and any increases in the Aggregate Revolving Commitments pursuant to Section 2.14 hereof), is set forth opposite the name of such Lender on Schedule 2.01, as it may change from time to time in accordance
with the terms hereof.  Applicable Rate means, from time to time:

Letters of Credit issued by it and the documents associated therewith, and the L/C Issuer shall have all of the benefits and immunities (A) provided to the Administrative Agent in Article IX with respect to any acts taken or
omissions suffered by the L/C Issuer in connection with Letters of Credit issued by it or proposed to be issued by it and Issuer Documents pertaining to such Letters of Credit as fully as if the term Administrative Agent as used in
Article IX included the L/C Issuer with respect to such acts or omissions, and (B) as additionally provided herein with respect to the L/C Issuer. 
(b) Procedures for Issuance and Amendment of Letters of Credit; Auto-Extension Letters of Credit. 
(i) Each Letter of Credit shall be issued or amended, as the case may be, upon the request of the Borrower delivered to the L/C
Issuer (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) in the form of a Letter of Credit Application, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower. Such Letter of Credit Application may be sent by facsimile, by United States
mail, by overnight courier, by electronic transmission using the system provided by the L/C Issuer, by personal delivery or by any other means acceptable to the L/C Issuer. Such Letter of Credit Application must be received by the L/C Issuer and the
Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. at least two (2) Business Days (or such later date and time as the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer may agree in a particular instance in their sole discretion) prior to the proposed
issuance date or date of amendment, as the case may be. In the case of a request for an initial issuance of a Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Application shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to the L/C Issuer: (A) the proposed
issuance date of the requested Letter of Credit (which shall be a Business Day); (B) the amount thereof; (C) the expiry date thereof; (D) the name and address of the beneficiary thereof; (E) the documents to be presented by such
beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; (F) the full text of any certificate to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; (G) the purpose and nature of the requested Letter of Credit; and (H) such
other matters as the L/C Issuer may reasonably require. In the case of a request for an amendment of any outstanding Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Application shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to the L/C Issuer (A) the
Letter of Credit to be amended; (B) the proposed date of amendment thereof (which shall be a Business Day); (C) the nature of the proposed amendment; and (D) such other matters as the L/C Issuer may reasonably require. Additionally,
the Borrower shall furnish to the L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent such other documents and information pertaining to such requested Letter of Credit issuance or amendment, including any Issuer Documents, as the L/C Issuer or the
Administrative Agent may reasonably require.  (ii) Promptly after receipt of any Letter of Credit Application, the L/C
Issuer will confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the Administrative Agent has received a copy of such Letter of Credit Application from the Borrower and, if not, the L/C Issuer will provide the Administrative Agent
with a copy thereof. Unless the L/C Issuer has received written notice from the Required Lenders, the Administrative Agent or the Borrower, at least one (1) Business Day prior to the requested date of issuance or amendment of the applicable
Letter of Credit, that one or more applicable conditions contained in Article IV shall not then be satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the L/C Issuer shall, on the requested date, issue a Letter of Credit for the
account of the Borrower (or the applicable Subsidiary) or enter into the applicable amendment, as the case may be, in each case in accordance with 
  27 



the L/C Issuers usual and customary business practices. Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
agrees to, purchase from the L/C Issuer a risk participation in such Letter of Credit in an amount equal to the product of such Lenders Applicable Percentage times the amount of such Letter of Credit. 
(iii) If the Borrower so requests in any applicable Letter of Credit Application, the L/C Issuer may, in its sole and absolute
discretion, agree to issue a Letter of Credit that has automatic extension provisions (each, an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit); provided that any such Auto-Extension Letter of Credit must permit the L/C Issuer to prevent
any such extension at least once in each twelve (12) month period (commencing with the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit) by giving prior notice to the beneficiary thereof not later than a day (the Non-Extension Notice
Date) in each such twelve (12) month period to be agreed upon at the time such Letter of Credit is issued. Unless otherwise directed by the L/C Issuer, the Borrower shall not be required to make a specific request to the L/C Issuer
for any such extension. Once an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit has been issued, the Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) the L/C Issuer to permit the extension of such Letter of Credit at any time to an expiry date not
later than the Letter of Credit Expiration Date; provided, however, that the L/C Issuer shall not permit any such extension if (A) the L/C Issuer has determined that it would not be permitted, or would have no obligation, at such
time to issue such Letter of Credit in its revised form (as extended) under the terms hereof (by reason of the provisions of clauses (ii) or (iii) of Section 2.03(a) or otherwise), or (B) it has received notice (which may
be by telephone or in writing) on or before the day that is seven (7) Business Days before the Non-Extension Notice Date (1) from the Administrative Agent that the Required Lenders have elected not to permit such extension or (2) from
the Administrative Agent, the Required Lenders or the Borrower that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in Section 4.02 is not then satisfied, and in each such case directing the L/C Issuer not to permit such extension.
 (iv) Promptly after its delivery of any Letter of Credit or any amendment to a Letter of Credit to an advising bank with
respect thereto or to the beneficiary thereof, the L/C Issuer will also deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent a true and complete copy of such Letter of Credit or amendment. 
(c) Drawings and Reimbursements; Funding of Participations. 
(i) Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit of any notice of a drawing under such Letter of Credit, the L/C
Issuer shall notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent thereof. Not later than 11:00 a.m. on the first Business Day immediately following the date of any payment by the L/C Issuer under a Letter of Credit (each such date, an Honor
Date), the Borrower shall reimburse the L/C Issuer through the Administrative Agent in an amount equal to the amount of such drawing (including any interest accrued on the amount of such drawing for any date(s) occurring after the Honor
Date where such drawing remains unreimbursed). If the Borrower fails to so reimburse the L/C Issuer by such time, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the Honor Date, the amount of the unreimbursed drawing (the
Unreimbursed Amount), and the amount of such Lenders Applicable Percentage thereof. In such event, the Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a Committed Revolving Borrowing of Base Rate Loans to be disbursed on the
Honor Date in an amount equal to the Unreimbursed Amount, without regard to the minimum and 
  28 



multiples specified in Section 2.02 for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans, but subject to the amount of the unutilized portion of the Aggregate Revolving Commitments and the
conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (other than the delivery of a Committed Revolving Loan Notice). Any notice given by the L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 2.03(c)(i) may be given by telephone
if immediately confirmed in writing; provided that the lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice. 
(ii) Each Lender shall upon any notice pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(i) make funds available (and the Administrative
Agent may apply Cash Collateral for this purpose) to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer at the Administrative Agents Office in an amount equal to its Applicable Percentage of the Unreimbursed Amount not later than 1:00
p.m. on the Business Day specified in such notice by the Administrative Agent, whereupon, subject to the provisions of Section 2.03(c)(iii), each Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Committed
Revolving Loan to the Borrower in such amount. The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the L/C Issuer. 
(iii) With respect to any Unreimbursed Amount that is not fully refinanced by a Committed Revolving Borrowing of Base Rate
Loans because the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 cannot be satisfied or for any other reason, the Borrower shall be deemed to have incurred from the L/C Issuer an L/C Borrowing in the amount of the Unreimbursed Amount that is not
so refinanced, which L/C Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the Default Rate. In such event, each Lenders payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer
pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(ii) shall be deemed payment in respect of its participation in such L/C Borrowing and shall constitute an L/C Advance from such Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this
Section 2.03.  (iv) Until each Lender funds its Committed Revolving Loan or L/C Advance pursuant to this
Section 2.03(c) to reimburse the L/C Issuer for any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of such Lenders Applicable Percentage of such amount shall be solely for the account of the L/C Issuer. 
(v) Each Lenders obligation to make Committed Revolving Loans or L/C Advances to reimburse the L/C Issuer for amounts
drawn under Letters of Credit, as contemplated by this Section 2.03(c), shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right
which such Lender may have against the L/C Issuer, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any
of the foregoing; provided, however, that each Lenders obligation to make Committed Revolving Loans pursuant to this Section 2.03(c) is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (other than
delivery by the Borrower of a Committed Revolving Loan Notice). No such making of an L/C Advance shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrower to reimburse the L/C Issuer for the amount of any payment made by the L/C Issuer under
any Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided herein.  (vi) If any Lender fails to make available to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the 
  29 



foregoing provisions of this Section 2.03(c) by the time specified in Section 2.03(c)(ii), the L/C Issuer shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the
Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the L/C Issuer at a rate per annum equal to the greater of the
Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the L/C Issuer in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the L/C Issuer in connection with the
foregoing. If such Lender pays such amount (with interest and fees as aforesaid), the amount so paid shall constitute such Lenders Committed Revolving Loan included in the relevant Committed Revolving Borrowing or L/C Advance in respect of the
relevant L/C Borrowing, as the case may be. A certificate of the L/C Issuer submitted to any Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (vi) shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
(d) Repayment of Participations. 
(i) At any time after the L/C Issuer has made a payment under any Letter of Credit and has received from any Lender such
Lenders L/C Advance in respect of such payment in accordance with Section 2.03(c), if the Administrative Agent receives for the account of the L/C Issuer any payment in respect of the related Unreimbursed Amount or interest thereon
(whether directly from the Borrower or otherwise, including proceeds of Cash Collateral applied thereto by the Administrative Agent), the Administrative Agent will distribute to such Lender its Applicable Percentage thereof in the same funds as
those received by the Administrative Agent.  (ii) If any payment received by the Administrative Agent for the account of
the L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(ii) is required to be returned under any of the circumstances described in Section 10.05 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the L/C Issuer in its discretion), each
Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer its Applicable Percentage thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned by such
Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect. The obligations of the Lenders under this clause shall survive the Termination Date. 
(e) Obligations Absolute. The obligation of the Borrower to reimburse the L/C Issuer for each drawing under each Letter
of Credit and to repay each L/C Borrowing shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all circumstances, including the following: 
(i) any lack of validity or enforceability of such Letter of Credit, this Agreement, or any other Loan Document; 
(ii) the existence of any claim, counterclaim, setoff, defense or other right that the Borrower or any Subsidiary may have at
any time against any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), the L/C Issuer or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, the
transactions contemplated hereby or by such Letter of Credit or any agreement or instrument relating thereto, or any unrelated transaction; 
  30 


(iii) any draft, demand, certificate or other document presented under such
Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; or any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to
make a drawing under such Letter of Credit;  (iv) waiver by the L/C Issuer of any requirement that exists for the L/C
Issuers protection and not the protection of the Borrower or any waiver by the L/C Issuer which does not in fact materially prejudice the Borrower; 
(v) honor of a demand for payment presented electronically even if such Letter of Credit requires that demand be in the form of
a draft;  (vi) any payment made by the L/C Issuer in respect of an otherwise complying item presented after the date
specified as the expiration date of, or the date by which documents must be received under such Letter of Credit if presentation after such date is authorized by the UCC, the ISP or the UCP, as applicable; 
(vii) any payment by the L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or certificate that does not
strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; or any payment made by the L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit to any Person purporting to be a trustee in bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors,
liquidator, receiver or other representative of or successor to any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit, including any arising in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law; or 
(viii) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, including any other
circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Borrower or any Subsidiary. 
The Borrower shall promptly examine a copy of each Letter of Credit and each amendment thereto that is delivered to it and, in
the event of any claim of noncompliance with the Borrowers instructions or other irregularity, the Borrower will promptly notify the L/C Issuer. The Borrower shall be conclusively deemed to have waived any such claim against the L/C Issuer and
its correspondents unless such notice is given as aforesaid.  (f) Role of L/C Issuer. Each Lender and the Borrower
agree that, in paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit, the L/C Issuer shall not have any responsibility to obtain any document (other than any sight draft, certificates and documents expressly required by the Letter of Credit) or to ascertain
or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such document or the authority of the Person executing or delivering any such document. None of the L/C Issuer, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent,
participant or assignee of the L/C Issuer shall be liable to any Lender for (i) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the approval of the Lenders or the Required Lenders, as applicable; (ii) any action
taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (iii) the due execution, effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any document or instrument related to any Letter of Credit or Issuer Document. The Borrower
hereby assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit; provided, however, that this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude the Borrowers
pursuing such rights and remedies as it may have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other agreement. None of the L/C Issuer, the Administrative Agent, any of 
  31 



their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of the L/C Issuer shall be liable or responsible for any of the matters described in clauses (i) through
(v) of Section 2.03(e); provided, however, that anything in such clauses to the contrary notwithstanding, the Borrower may have a claim against the L/C Issuer, and the L/C Issuer may be liable to the Borrower, to the
extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to consequential or exemplary, damages suffered by the Borrower which the Borrower proves were caused by the L/C Issuers willful misconduct or gross negligence or the L/C Issuers
willful failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the beneficiary of a sight draft and certificate(s) strictly complying with the terms and conditions of a Letter of Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing, the L/C Issuer may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and the L/C Issuer shall not be responsible for the
validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective
for any reason. The L/C Issuer may send a Letter of Credit or conduct any communication to or from the beneficiary via the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) message or overnight courier, or any
other commercially reasonable means of communicating with a beneficiary.  (g) Applicability of ISP. Unless otherwise
expressly agreed by the L/C Issuer and the Borrower when a Letter of Credit is issued, the rules of the ISP shall apply to each Letter of Credit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the L/C Issuer shall not be responsible to the Borrower for, and the L/C
Issuers rights and remedies against the Borrower shall not be impaired by, any action or inaction of the L/C Issuer required under any Law that is required to be applied to any Letter of Credit, including the Law or any order of a jurisdiction
where the L/C Issuer or the beneficiary is located, the practice stated in the ISP or in the decisions, opinions, practice statements, or official commentary of the ICC Banking Commission, the Bankers Association for Finance and Trade -
International Financial Services Association (BAFT-IFSA), or the Institute of International Banking Law & Practice, whether or not any Letter of Credit chooses such Law or practice. 
(h) Letter of Credit Fees. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender in
accordance with its Applicable Percentage a Letter of Credit fee (the Letter of Credit Fee) for each Letter of Credit that has been issued and is outstanding equal to the Applicable Rate for Eurodollar Rate Loans times the
daily amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit; provided, however, any Letter of Credit Fees otherwise payable for the account of a Defaulting Lender with respect to any Letter of Credit as to which such Defaulting
Lender has not provided Cash Collateral satisfactory to the L/C Issuer pursuant to this Section 2.03 shall be payable, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, to the other Lenders in accordance with the upward adjustments in
their respective Applicable Percentages allocable to such Letter of Credit pursuant to Section 2.16(b), with the balance of such fee, if any, payable to the L/C Issuer for its own account. For purposes of computing the daily amount
available to be drawn under any Letter of Credit, the amount of such Letter of Credit shall be determined in accordance with Section 1.06. Letter of Credit Fees shall be (i) due and payable on the last day of each March, June,
September and December, commencing with the first such date to occur after the issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the Letter of Credit Expiration Date and thereafter on demand and (ii) computed on a quarterly basis in arrears. If there is
any change in the Applicable Rate during any quarter, the daily amount available to be drawn under each Letter of Credit shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Rate separately for each period during such quarter that such Applicable Rate
was in effect. 
  32 


(i) Fronting Fee and Documentary and Processing Charges Payable to L/C
Issuer. The Borrower shall pay directly to the L/C Issuer for its own account a fronting fee with respect to each Letter of Credit, at the rate per annum specified in the BAML Fee Letter, computed on the daily amount available to be drawn under
such Letter of Credit on a quarterly basis in arrears. Such fronting fee shall be due and payable on the last day of each March, June, September and December in respect of the most recently-ended fiscal quarter (or portion thereof, in the case of
the first payment), commencing with the first such date to occur after the issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the Letter of Credit Expiration Date and thereafter on demand. For purposes of computing the daily amount available to be drawn under
any Letter of Credit, the amount of such Letter of Credit shall be determined in accordance with Section 1.06. In addition, the Borrower shall pay directly to the L/C Issuer for its own account the customary issuance, presentation,
amendment and other processing fees, and other standard costs and charges, of the L/C Issuer relating to letters of credit as from time to time in effect. Such customary fees and standard costs and charges are due and payable on demand and are
nonrefundable.  (j) Conflict with Issuer Documents. In the event of any conflict between the terms hereof and the
terms of any Issuer Document, the terms hereof shall control.  (k) Letters of Credit Issued for Subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding that a Letter of Credit issued or outstanding hereunder is in support of any obligations of, or is for the account of, any Subsidiary of the Borrower, the Borrower shall be obligated to reimburse the L/C Issuer hereunder for any and
all drawings under such Letter of Credit. The Borrower hereby acknowledges that the issuance of Letters of Credit for the account of any Subsidiary of the Borrower inures to the benefit of the Borrower, and that the Borrowers business derives
substantial benefits from the businesses of such Subsidiaries.  2.04 Swing Line Loans. 
(a) The Swing Line. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Swing Line Lender agrees, in reliance upon
the agreements of the other Lenders set forth in this Section 2.04, to make loans (each such loan, a Swing Line Loan) to the Borrower from time to time on any Business Day during the Availability Period in an aggregate
amount not to exceed at any time outstanding the amount of the Swing Line Sublimit, notwithstanding the fact that such Swing Line Loans, when aggregated with the Applicable Percentage of the Outstanding Amount of the Committed Revolving Loans and
L/C Obligations of the Lender acting as Swing Line Lender, may exceed the amount of such Lenders Revolving Commitment; provided, however, that (i) after giving effect to any Swing Line Loan, the Total Outstandings shall not
exceed the Aggregate Revolving Commitments, (ii) the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Committed Revolving Loans of any Lender, plus such Lenders Applicable Percentage of the Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations, plus
such Lenders Applicable Percentage of the Outstanding Amount of all Swing Line Loans shall not exceed such Lenders Revolving Commitment, (iii) the Borrower shall not use the proceeds of any Swing Line Loan to refinance any
outstanding Swing Line Loan and (iv) the Swing Line Lender shall not be under any obligation to make any Swing Line Loan if it shall determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that it has, or by such
Credit Extension may have, Fronting Exposure. Within the foregoing limits, and subject to the other terms and conditions hereof, the Borrower may borrow under this Section 2.04, prepay under Section 2.05, and reborrow under
this Section 2.04. Each Swing Line Loan shall be a Base Rate Loan. Immediately upon the making of a Swing Line Loan, each Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the Swing Line
Lender a risk participation in such Swing Line Loan in an amount equal to the product of such Lenders Applicable Percentage times the amount of such Swing Line Loan. 
  33 


(b) Borrowing Procedures. Each Swing Line Borrowing shall be made upon the
Borrowers irrevocable notice to the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent, which may be given by (A) telephone or (B) by a Swing Line Loan Notice; provided that any telephonic notice must be confirmed promptly
by delivery to the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent of a Swing Line Loan Notice, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower. Each Swing Line Loan Notice must be received by the Swing Line Lender and the
Administrative Agent not later than 1:00 p.m. on the requested borrowing date (or such later time as shall be acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the Swing Line Lender in their sole discretion), and shall specify (i) the amount to be
borrowed, which shall be a minimum of One Hundred Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($100,000.00), and (ii) the requested borrowing date, which shall be a Business Day. Promptly after receipt by the Swing Line Lender of any Swing Line Loan Notice,
the Swing Line Lender will confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the Administrative Agent has also received such Swing Line Loan Notice and, if not, the Swing Line Lender will notify the Administrative Agent (by
telephone or in writing) of the contents thereof. Unless the Swing Line Lender has received notice (by telephone or in writing) from the Administrative Agent (including at the request of the Required Lenders) prior to 2:00 p.m. on the date of the
proposed Swing Line Borrowing (A) directing the Swing Line Lender not to make such Swing Line Loan as a result of the limitations set forth in the first proviso to the first sentence of Section 2.04(a), or (B) that one or more
of the applicable conditions specified in Article IV is not then satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Swing Line Lender will, not later than 3:00 p.m. on the borrowing date specified in such Swing Line Loan Notice,
make the amount of its Swing Line Loan available to the Borrower.  (c) Refinancing of Swing Line Loans. 
(i) The Swing Line Lender at any time in its sole and absolute discretion may request, on behalf of the Borrower (which hereby
irrevocably authorizes the Swing Line Lender to so request on its behalf), that each Lender make a Base Rate Committed Revolving Loan in an amount equal to such Lenders Applicable Percentage of the amount of Swing Line Loans then outstanding.
Such request shall be made in writing (which written request shall be deemed to be a Committed Revolving Loan Notice for purposes hereof) and in accordance with the requirements of Section 2.02, without regard to the minimum and
multiples specified therein for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans, but subject to the unutilized portion of the Aggregate Revolving Commitments and the conditions set forth in Section 4.02. The Swing Line Lender shall furnish the
Borrower with a copy of the applicable Committed Revolving Loan Notice promptly after delivering such notice to the Administrative Agent. Each Lender shall make an amount equal to its Applicable Percentage of the amount specified in such Committed
Revolving Loan Notice available to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds (and the Administrative Agent may apply Cash Collateral available with respect to the applicable Swing Line Loan) for the account of the Swing Line Lender at
the Administrative Agents Office not later than 1:00 p.m. on the day specified in such Committed Revolving Loan Notice, whereupon, subject to Section 2.04(c)(ii), each Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have
made a Base Rate Committed Revolving Loan to the Borrower in such amount. The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the Swing Line Lender. 
(ii) If for any reason any Swing Line Loan cannot be refinanced by such a Committed Revolving Borrowing in accordance with
Section 2.04(c)(i), the request for Base Rate Committed Revolving Loans submitted by the Swing Line Lender as set forth 
  34 



herein shall be deemed to be a request by the Swing Line Lender that each of the Lenders fund its risk participation in the relevant Swing Line Loan and each Lenders payment to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Swing Line Lender pursuant to Section 2.04(c)(i) shall be deemed payment in respect of such participation. 
(iii) If any Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swing Line Lender any amount
required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.04(c) by the time specified in Section 2.04(c)(i), the Swing Line Lender shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through
the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the Swing Line Lender at a rate per annum equal to the
greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Swing Line Lender in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Swing Line Lender in
connection with the foregoing. If such Lender pays such amount (with interest and fees as aforesaid), the amount so paid shall constitute such Lenders Committed Revolving Loan included in the relevant Committed Revolving Borrowing or funded
participation in the relevant Swing Line Loan, as the case may be. A certificate of the Swing Line Lender submitted to any Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (iii) shall be conclusive
absent manifest error.  (iv) Each Lenders obligation to make Committed Revolving Loans or to purchase and fund risk
participations in Swing Line Loans pursuant to this Section 2.04(c) shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which
such Lender may have against the Swing Line Lender, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any
of the foregoing; provided, however, that each Lenders obligation to make Committed Revolving Loans pursuant to this Section 2.04(c) is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 4.02. No such funding
of risk participations shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrower to repay Swing Line Loans, together with interest as provided herein. 
(d) Repayment of Participations. 
(i) At any time after any Lender has purchased and funded a risk participation in a Swing Line Loan, if the Swing Line Lender
receives any payment on account of such Swing Line Loan, the Swing Line Lender will distribute to such Lender its Applicable Percentage thereof in the same funds as those received by the Swing Line Lender. 
(ii) If any payment received by the Swing Line Lender in respect of principal or interest on any Swing Line Loan is required to
be returned by the Swing Line Lender under any of the circumstances described in Section 10.05 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Swing Line Lender in its discretion), each Lender shall pay to the Swing Line Lender
its Applicable Percentage thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate. The Administrative Agent will make
such demand upon the request of the Swing Line Lender. The obligations of the Lenders under this clause shall survive the Termination Date. 
  35 


(e) Interest for Account of Swing Line Lender. The Swing Line Lender shall
be responsible for invoicing the Borrower for interest on the Swing Line Loans. Until each Lender funds its Base Rate Committed Revolving Loan or risk participation pursuant to this Section 2.04 to refinance such Lenders Applicable
Percentage of any Swing Line Loan, interest in respect of such Applicable Percentage shall be solely for the account of the Swing Line Lender. 
(f) Payments Directly to Swing Line Lender. The Borrower shall make all payments of principal and interest in respect of
the Swing Line Loans directly to the Swing Line Lender.  2.05 Prepayments. 
(a) The Borrower may, upon notice to the Administrative Agent, at any time or from time to time voluntarily prepay Committed
Revolving Loans in whole or in part without premium or penalty; provided that (i) such notice must be in the form of a Notice of Loan Prepayment and be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. (A) three
(3) Business Days prior to any date of prepayment of Eurodollar Rate Loans and (B) on the date of prepayment of Base Rate Committed Revolving Loans; (ii) any prepayment of Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of Five
Million and No/100 Dollars ($5,000,000.00) or a whole multiple of One Million and No/100 Dollars ($1,000,000.00) in excess thereof; and (iii) any prepayment of Base Rate Committed Revolving Loans shall be in a principal amount of Five Hundred
Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($500,000.00) or a whole multiple of One Hundred Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($100,000.00) in excess thereof or, in each case, if less, the entire principal amount thereof then outstanding. Each such notice shall specify
the date and amount of such prepayment and the Type(s) of Committed Revolving Loans to be prepaid and, if Eurodollar Rate Loans are to be prepaid, the Interest Period(s) of such Loans. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Lender of its
receipt of each such notice, and of the amount of such Lenders Applicable Percentage of such prepayment. If such notice is given by the Borrower, the Borrower shall make such prepayment and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be
due and payable on the date specified therein; provided that a Notice of Loan Prepayment delivered by the Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other transactions, in which case such notice may be
revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. Any prepayment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be accompanied by all accrued interest on the amount
prepaid, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.05. Each such prepayment shall be applied to the Committed Revolving Loans of the Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages. 
(b) The Borrower may, upon notice to the Swing Line Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at any time or from time
to time, voluntarily prepay Swing Line Loans in whole or in part without premium or penalty; provided that (i) such notice must be received by the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent not later than 1:00 p.m. on the date of the
prepayment (or such later time as shall be acceptable to the Swing Line Lender in its sole discretion), and (ii) any such prepayment shall be in a minimum principal amount of One Hundred Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($100,000.00). Each such
notice shall specify the date and amount of such prepayment. If such notice is given by the Borrower, the Borrower shall make such prepayment and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein.
 (c) If for any reason the Total Outstandings at any time exceed the Aggregate Revolving Commitments then in effect, the
Borrower shall within one Business Day of receipt of notice from the Administrative Agent, prepay Loans and/or Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations in an aggregate amount equal to such excess; provided, however, that the Borrower
shall not be required to Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations pursuant to this Section 2.05(c) unless after the prepayment in full of the Loans the Total Outstandings exceed the Aggregate Revolving Commitments then in effect.

  36 


2.06 Termination or Reduction of Revolving Commitments. The Borrower may, upon
notice to the Administrative Agent, terminate the Aggregate Revolving Commitments, or from time to time permanently reduce the Aggregate Revolving Commitments; provided that (i) any such notice shall be received by the Administrative
Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. five (5) Business Days prior to the date of termination or reduction, (ii) any such partial reduction shall be in an aggregate amount of Ten Million and No/100 Dollars ($10,000,000.00) or any whole multiple
of One Million and No/100 Dollars ($1,000,000.00) in excess thereof, (iii) the Borrower shall not terminate or reduce the Aggregate Revolving Commitments if, after giving effect thereto and to any concurrent prepayments hereunder, the Total
Outstandings would exceed the Aggregate Revolving Commitments, and (iv) if, after giving effect to any reduction of the Aggregate Revolving Commitments, the Letter of Credit Sublimit or the Swing Line Sublimit exceeds the amount of the
Aggregate Revolving Commitments, such Sublimit shall be automatically reduced by the amount of such excess. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Lenders of any such notice of termination or reduction of the Aggregate Revolving
Commitments. Any reduction of the Aggregate Revolving Commitments shall be applied to the Revolving Commitment of each Lender according to its Applicable Percentage. All fees accrued until the effective date of any termination of the Aggregate
Revolving Commitments shall be paid on the effective date of such termination.  2.07 Repayment of Loans. 
(a) The Borrower shall repay to the Lenders on the Maturity Date the aggregate principal amount of Committed Revolving Loans
and all other Obligations outstanding on such date.  (b) The Borrower shall repay each Swing Line Loan on the earlier to
occur of (i) the date ten (10) Business Days after such Loan is made (provided that, if not earlier repaid or refinanced pursuant to Section 2.04(c) by 10:00 a.m. one (1) Business Day prior such date, the Swing Line Lender
shall make a request for such Swing Line Loans to be refinanced by a Borrowing of Base Rate Committed Revolving Loans in accordance with Section 2.04(c)) and (ii) the Maturity Date. 
2.08 Interest. 
(a) Subject to the provisions of subsection (b) below, (i) each Eurodollar Rate Loan shall bear interest on the
outstanding principal amount thereof for each Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Rate; (ii) each Base Rate Committed Revolving Loan shall bear interest on the
outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate; and (iii) each Swing Line Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof
from the applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate. 
  37 


(b) (i) If any Event of Default has occurred under Section 8.01(a)(i)
or (ii), whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, such overdue amount shall thereafter bear interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Laws.  (ii) Accrued and unpaid interest on past due amounts (including interest on past due interest) shall be
due and payable upon demand.  (c) Interest on each Loan shall be due and payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date
applicable thereto and at such other times as may be specified herein. Interest hereunder shall be due and payable in accordance with the terms hereof before and after judgment, and before and after the commencement of any proceeding under any
Debtor Relief Law.  2.09 Fees. In addition to certain fees described in subsections (h) and (i) of
Section 2.03:  (a) Facility Fees. The Borrower shall pay a fee to the Administrative Agent for the
benefit of the Lenders in accordance with their Applicable Percentages in an amount equal to the Daily Facility Fee for such day (all such fees incurred during any given calendar quarter constituting the Facility Fees for such
quarter). The Facility Fees shall be payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of each calendar quarter and as of the Maturity Date. 
(b) Other Fees. 
(i) The Borrower shall pay to the Arrangers and the Administrative Agent for their own respective accounts fees in the amounts
and at the times specified in the Fee Letters. Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever. 
(ii) The Borrower shall pay to the Lenders such fees as shall have been separately agreed upon in writing in the amounts and at
the times so specified. Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever.  2.10
Computation of Interest and Fees; Retroactive Adjustments of Applicable Rate.  (a) All computations of interest
for Base Rate Loans shall be made on the basis of a year of three hundred sixty-five (365) or three hundred sixty-six (366) days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed. All other computations of fees and interest shall be made on the
basis of a three hundred sixty (360) day year and actual days elapsed (which results in more fees or interest, as applicable, being paid than if computed on the basis of a three hundred sixty-five (365) day year). Interest shall accrue on
each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion is paid, provided that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall,
subject to Section 2.12(a), bear interest for one (1) day. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. 
(b) If, as a result of any restatement of or other adjustment to the financial statements of the Borrower or for any other
reason, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent reasonably determine that (i) the Consolidated Leverage Ratio as calculated by the Borrower as of any applicable date was inaccurate and (ii) a proper calculation of the Consolidated
Leverage Ratio 
  38 



would have resulted in higher pricing for such period, the Borrower shall immediately and retroactively be obligated to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Lenders,
the L/C Issuer or the Swing Line Lender, as the case may be, promptly on demand by the Administrative Agent (or, after the occurrence of an actual or deemed entry of an order for relief with respect to the Borrower under the Bankruptcy Code of the
United States, automatically and without further action by the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer), an amount equal to the excess of the amount of interest and fees that should have been paid for such period over the amount of
interest and fees actually paid for such period. This paragraph shall not limit the rights of the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, under Section 2.03(c)(iii), 2.03(h) or 2.08(b) or
under Article VIII. The Borrowers obligations under this paragraph shall survive the termination of the Aggregate Revolving Commitments and the repayment of all other Obligations hereunder. 
2.11 Evidence of Debt. 
(a) The Credit Extensions made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender
and by the Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of business. The accounts or records maintained by the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of the Credit Extensions made by the Lenders
to the Borrower and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations.
In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the
absence of manifest error. Upon the request of any Lender made through the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative Agent) a Note or Notes, which shall evidence such Lenders Loans
(Revolving Loans or Swing Line Loans) in addition to such accounts or records. Each Lender may attach schedules to its Note(s) and endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto.
 (b) In addition to the accounts and records referred to in subsection (a), each Lender and the Administrative Agent shall
maintain in accordance with its usual practice accounts or records evidencing the purchases and sales by such Lender of participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records
maintained by the Administrative Agent and the accounts and records of any Lender in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. 
2.12 Payments Generally; Administrative Agents Clawback. 
(a) General. Except as provided in Section 3.01, all payments to be made by the Borrower shall be made free
and clear of and without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrower hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of
the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the Administrative Agents Office in Dollars and in immediately available funds not later than 2:00 p.m. on the date specified herein. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to
each Lender its Applicable Percentage (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lenders Lending Office. All payments received by the Administrative Agent after 2:00 p.m.
shall be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue. 
  39 


(b) (i) Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent. Unless
the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Committed Revolving Borrowing of Eurodollar Rate Loans (or, in the case of any Committed Revolving Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, prior to 12:00 noon
on the date of such Committed Revolving Borrowing) that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lenders share of such Committed Revolving Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made
such share available on such date in accordance with Section 2.02 (or, in the case of a Committed Revolving Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, that such Lender has made such share available in accordance with and at the time required by
Section 2.02) and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Committed Revolving Borrowing available to the
Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including
the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by
the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing, and (B) in the
case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans. If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall
promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Committed Revolving Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such
Lenders Committed Revolving Loan included in such Committed Revolving Borrowing. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the
Administrative Agent.  (ii) Payments by Borrower; Presumptions by Administrative Agent. Unless the Administrative
Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the L/C Issuer hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative
Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower
has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, in immediately
available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the
Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation. 
  40 


A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect to any amount
owing under this subsection (b) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.  (c) Failure to Satisfy Conditions
Precedent. If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this Article II, and such funds are not made available to the Borrower by the
Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable Credit Extension set forth in Article IV are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as
received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest.  (d) Obligations of Lenders Several. The obligations of
the Lenders hereunder to make Committed Revolving Loans, to fund participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans and to make payments pursuant to Section 10.04(c) are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any
Committed Revolving Loan, to fund any such participation or to make any payment under Section 10.04(c) on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender
shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Committed Revolving Loan, to purchase its participation or to make its payment under Section 10.04(c). 
(e) Funding Source. Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any
particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner. 
2.13 Sharing of Payments by Lenders. If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain
payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of the Committed Revolving Loans made by it, or the participations in L/C Obligations or in Swing Line Loans held by it resulting in such Lenders receiving payment of a proportion of
the aggregate amount of such Committed Revolving Loans or participations and accrued interest thereon greater than its pro rata share thereof as provided herein, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify
the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Committed Revolving Loans and subparticipations in L/C Obligations and Swing Line Loans of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments
as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Committed Revolving Loans and other amounts owing
them, provided that:  (i) if any such participations or subparticipations are purchased and all or any portion of
the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations or subparticipations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and 
(ii) the provisions of this Section shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by or on behalf of the
Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender), (y) the application of Cash Collateral provided for in
Section 2.15 or (z) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Committed Revolving Loans or subparticipations in L/C Obligations or Swing Line Loans to any
assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this Section shall apply). 
  41 


The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under
applicable Law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor
of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.  2.14 Increase in Revolving Commitments. 
(a) Request for Increase. Provided there exists no Default, upon notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall
promptly notify the Lenders), the Borrower may request increases in the Aggregate Revolving Commitments by an amount not exceeding, in the aggregate, Two Hundred Fifty Million and No/100 Dollars ($250,000,000); provided that (i) any such
request for an increase shall be in a minimum amount of Ten Million and No/100 Dollars ($10,000,000.00) and in Five Million Dollar ($5,000,000) increments in excess thereof and (ii) at no time shall the Aggregate Revolving Commitments exceed
Five Hundred Million Dollars ($500,000,000). At the time of sending such notice, the Borrower (in consultation with the Administrative Agent) shall specify the time period within which each Lender is requested to respond (which shall in no event be
less than ten (10) Business Days from the date of delivery of such notice to the Lenders) and the Borrower may also invite prospective lenders to respond. 
(b) Lender Elections to Increase. Each Lender shall notify the Administrative Agent within such time period specified
under subsection (a) above whether or not it agrees to increase its Revolving Commitment and, if so, whether by an amount equal to, greater than, or less than its Applicable Percentage of such requested increase. Any Lender not responding
within such time period shall be deemed to have declined to increase its Revolving Commitment. Each prospective lender shall notify the Administrative Agent within such time period whether or not it agrees to fund any portion of the requested
increase in the Aggregate Revolving Commitments and, if so, by what amount. Any prospective lender not responding within such time period shall be deemed to have declined to fund any portion of the requested increase in the Aggregate Revolving
Commitments.  (c) Notification by Administrative Agent; Additional Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall notify
the Borrower and each Lender of the Lenders and prospective lenders responses to each request made hereunder. To achieve the full amount of a requested increase and subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and
the Swing Line Lender (which approvals shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), the Borrower may also invite additional Eligible Assignees to become Lenders. If any prospective lender agrees to fund any portion of the requested increase in
the Aggregate Revolving Commitments (an Additional Lender), such Additional Lender shall become a Lender hereunder pursuant to a joinder agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. 
(d) Effective Date and Allocations. If the Aggregate Revolving Commitments are increased in accordance with this
Section, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall determine the effective date (the Increase Effective Date) and the final allocation of such increase which, for any existing Lender participating in such increase, need not
be ratable in accordance with their respective Revolving Commitments prior to such increase. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the final allocation of such increase and the Increase Effective Date. 
(e) Conditions to Effectiveness of Increase. As conditions precedent to such increase, the Borrower shall (i) pay
any fees agreed to in connection therewith, (ii) deliver to the Administrative Agent a certificate of the Borrower dated as of the Increase Effective Date signed 
  42 



by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower (x) certifying and attaching the resolutions adopted by the Borrower approving or consenting to such increase, and (y) certifying that, before
and after giving effect to such increase, (A) no Default exists and (B) the Borrower is in compliance, on a Pro Forma Basis, with the financial covenants in Section 7.07 and (iii) deliver a favorable opinion from counsel
to the Borrower, addressed to the Administrative Agent and each Lender. The Borrower shall prepay any Committed Revolving Loans outstanding on the Increase Effective Date (and pay any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.05)
to the extent necessary to keep the outstanding Committed Revolving Loans ratable with any revised Applicable Percentages arising from any nonratable increase in the Revolving Commitments under this Section. 
(f) Conflicting Provisions. This Section shall supersede any provisions in Sections 2.13 or
10.01 to the contrary.  2.15 Cash Collateral. 
(a) Certain Credit Support Events. If (i) the L/C Issuer has honored any full or partial drawing request under any
Letter of Credit and such drawing has resulted in an L/C Borrowing, (ii) as of the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, any L/C Obligation for any reason remains outstanding, (iii) the Borrower shall be required to provide Cash Collateral
pursuant to Section 8.02(c) or (iv) there shall exist any Fronting Exposure, the Borrower shall immediately (in the case of clause (iii) above) or within one Business Day (in all other cases) following any request by the
Administrative Agent or the L/C Issuer provide Cash Collateral in an amount not less than the applicable Minimum Collateral Amount (determined in the case of Cash Collateral provided pursuant to clause (iv) above, after giving effect to
Section 2.16(b) and any Cash Collateral provided by the Defaulting Lender).  (b) Grant of Security
Interest. The Borrower, and to the extent provided by any Defaulting Lender, such Defaulting Lender, hereby grants to (and subjects to the control of) the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and the
Lenders, and agrees to maintain, a first priority security interest in all such cash, deposit accounts and all balances therein, and all other property so provided as collateral pursuant hereto, and in all proceeds of the foregoing, all as security
for the obligations to which such Cash Collateral may be applied pursuant to Section 2.15(c). If at any time the Administrative Agent determines that Cash Collateral is subject to any right or claim of any Person other than the
Administrative Agent or the L/C Issuer as herein provided, or that the total amount of such Cash Collateral is less than the Minimum Collateral Amount, the Borrower will, promptly upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay or provide to the
Administrative Agent additional Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to eliminate such deficiency. All Cash Collateral (other than credit support not constituting funds subject to deposit) shall be maintained in blocked, non-interest bearing
deposit accounts at Bank of America. The Borrower shall pay on demand therefor from time to time all customary account opening, activity and other administrative fees and charges in connection with the maintenance and disbursement of Cash
Collateral.  (c) Application. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Cash Collateral
provided under any of this Section 2.15 or Sections 2.03, 2.05, 2.16 or 8.02 in respect of Letters of Credit shall be held and applied to the satisfaction of the specific L/C Obligations, obligations to fund
participations therein (including, as to Cash Collateral provided by a Defaulting Lender, any interest accrued on such obligation) and other obligations for which the Cash Collateral was so provided, prior to any other application of such property
as may otherwise be provided for herein. 
  43 


(d) Release. Cash Collateral (or the appropriate portion thereof) provided
to reduce Fronting Exposure or to secure other Obligations shall be released promptly following (i) the elimination of the applicable Fronting Exposure or other Obligations giving rise thereto (including by the termination of Defaulting Lender
status of the applicable Lender (or, as appropriate, its assignee following compliance with Section 10.06(b)(vii))) or (ii) the determination by the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer that there exists excess Cash Collateral;
provided, however, the Person providing Cash Collateral and the L/C Issuer may agree that Cash Collateral shall not be released but instead held to support future anticipated Fronting Exposure or other Obligations. 
2.16 Defaulting Lenders. 
(a) Adjustments. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a
Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as that Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable Law: 
(i) Waivers and Amendments. Such Defaulting Lenders right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or
consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in the definition of Required Lenders and Section 10.01. 
(ii) Defaulting Lender Waterfall. Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the
Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Article VIII or otherwise) or received by the Administrative Agent from a Defaulting Lender pursuant to
Section 10.08 shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder;
second, to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender hereunder; third, to Cash Collateralize the L/C Issuers Fronting Exposure with respect to such
Defaulting Lender in accordance with Section 2.15; fourth, as the Borrower may request (so long as no Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as
required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent; fifth, if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to be held in a deposit account and released pro rata in order to (x) satisfy such Defaulting
Lenders potential future funding obligations with respect to Loans under this Agreement and (y) Cash Collateralize the L/C Issuers future Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender with respect to future Letters of
Credit issued under this Agreement, in accordance with Section 2.15; sixth, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Non-Defaulting Lenders, the L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender as a result of any judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction obtained by any Non-Defaulting Lender, the L/C Issuer or the Swing Line Lender against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement; seventh, to the payment of
any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement;
and eighth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans or L/C Borrowings in respect of which such
Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share, and (y) such Loans were made or the related Letters of Credit were issued at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 were satisfied or waived, such payment
shall be 
  44 



applied solely to pay the Loans of, and L/C Obligations owed to, all Non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of, or L/C Obligations owed to,
such Defaulting Lender until such time as all Loans and funded and unfunded participations in L/C Obligations and Swing Line Loans are held by the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the Revolving Commitments hereunder without giving effect to
Section 2.16(b). Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant to this
Section 2.16(a)(ii) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto. 
(iii) Certain Fees. (A) Each Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive a Facility Fee for any period during
which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender only to extent allocable to the sum of (1) the outstanding principal amount of the Revolving Loans funded by it and (2) its Applicable Percentage of the stated amount of Letters of Credit for which
it has provided Cash Collateral pursuant to Section 2.15.  (B) No Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to
receive any Letter of Credit Fee for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and the Borrower shall not be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender);
provided, however, notwithstanding the above, each Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive Letter of Credit Fees for any period during which such Lender is a Defaulting Lender to the extent allocable to its Applicable Percentage of the stated
amount of Letters of Credit for which it has provided Cash Collateral pursuant to Section 2.15.  (C) (1) With
respect to any Letter of Credit Fee not required to be paid to any Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (B) above, the Borrower shall (x) pay to each Non-Defaulting Lender that portion of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting
Lender with respect to such Defaulting Lenders participation in L/C Obligations that has been reallocated to such Non-Defaulting Lender pursuant to subsection (b) below, (y) pay to the L/C Issuer the remaining amount of any such fee
otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender after giving effect to the amount paid in clause (x) to the extent allocable to such L/C Issuers Fronting Exposure to such Defaulting Lender and (z) not be required to pay the remaining
amount of any such fee. (2) With respect to any fee payable under Section 2.09(a) not required to be paid to any Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (A) above, the Borrower shall (x) pay to the L/C Issuer the amount of
any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender to the extent allocable to such L/C Issuers Fronting Exposure to such Defaulting Lender, and (y) not be required to pay the remaining amount of any such fee. 
(b) Reallocation of Applicable Percentages to Reduce Fronting Exposure. All or any part of such Defaulting Lenders
participation in L/C Obligations and Swing Line Loans shall be reallocated among the Non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages (calculated without regard to such Defaulting Lenders Revolving Commitment)
but only to the extent that (x) the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 are satisfied at the time of such reallocation (and, unless the Borrower shall have otherwise notified the Administrative Agent at such time, the Borrower
shall be deemed to have represented and warranted that such conditions are satisfied at such time), and (y) such reallocation does not cause the aggregate Revolving 
  45 



Credit Exposure of any Non-Defaulting Lender to exceed such Non-Defaulting Lenders Revolving Commitment. No reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any
party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a Non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such Non-Defaulting Lenders increased exposure following such reallocation.
 (c) Cash Collateral, Repayment of Swing Line Loans. If the reallocation described in clause (b) above cannot,
or can only partially, be effected, then, within one (1) Business Day following notice by the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall, without prejudice to any right or remedy available to it hereunder or under applicable Law, (x) first,
prepay Swing Line Loans in an amount equal to the Swing Line Lenders Fronting Exposure and (y) second, Cash Collateralize the L/C Issuers Fronting Exposure in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.15.
 (d) Defaulting Lender Cure. If the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Swing Line Lender and the L/C Issuer
agree in writing that a Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may
include arrangements with respect to any Cash Collateral), that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be
necessary to cause the Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans to be held on a pro rata basis by the Lenders in accordance with their Applicable Percentages (without giving effect to
Section 2.16(b)), whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while that Lender was a
Defaulting Lender; and provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder
arising from that Lenders having been a Defaulting Lender.  ARTICLE III 
TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY 
3.01 Taxes. 
(a) Payments Free of Taxes; Obligation to Withhold; Payments on Account of Taxes. 
(i) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower under any Loan Document shall be made without
deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable Laws. If any applicable Laws (as determined in the good faith discretion of the Administrative Agent) require the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by
the Administrative Agent or the Borrower, then the Administrative Agent or the Borrower shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding, upon the basis of the information and documentation to be delivered pursuant to subsection
(e) below.  (ii) If the Borrower or the Administrative Agent shall be required by the Code to withhold or deduct
any Taxes, including both United States Federal backup withholding and withholding taxes, from any payment, then (A) the Administrative 
  46 



Agent shall withhold or make such deductions as are determined by the Administrative Agent to be required based upon the information and documentation it has received pursuant to subsection
(e) below, (B) the Administrative Agent shall timely pay the full amount withheld or deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with the Code, and (C) to the extent that the withholding or deduction is made on
account of Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the Borrower shall be increased as necessary so that after any required withholding or the making of all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this
Section 3.01) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such withholding or deduction been made. 
(iii) If the Borrower or the Administrative Agent shall be required by any applicable Laws other than the Code to withhold or
deduct any Taxes from any payment, then (A) the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as required by such Laws, shall withhold or make such deductions as are determined by it to be required based upon the information and documentation it has
received pursuant to subsection (e) below, (B) the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, to the extent required by such Laws, shall timely pay the full amount withheld or deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance
with such Laws, and (C) to the extent that the withholding or deduction is made on account of Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the Borrower shall be increased as necessary so that after any required withholding or the making of all
required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 3.01) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such withholding or deduction been made.
 (b) Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower. Without limiting the provisions of subsection (a) above,
the Borrower shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Law, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes. 
(c) Tax Indemnifications. 
(i) The Borrower shall, and does hereby indemnify each Recipient, and shall make payment in respect thereof within ten
(10) days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 3.01) payable or paid by such Recipient or
required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient, and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto (other than penalties, interest and expenses payable by reason of the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of such Recipient), whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to
the Borrower by a Lender or the L/C Issuer (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or the L/C Issuer, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall, and
does hereby, indemnify the Administrative Agent, and shall make payment in respect thereof within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for any amount which a Lender or the L/C Issuer for any reason fails to pay indefeasibly to the
Administrative Agent as required pursuant to Section 3.01(c)(ii) below. 
  47 


(ii) Each Lender or the L/C Issuer shall, and does hereby, severally indemnify,
and shall make payment in respect thereof within ten (10) days after demand therefor, (x) the Administrative Agent against any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender or the L/C Issuer (but only to the extent that the Borrower has
not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), (y) the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, as applicable, against any Taxes attributable to such
Lenders failure to comply with the provisions of Section 11.06(d) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (z) the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, as applicable, against any Excluded Taxes attributable
to such Lender or the L/C Issuer that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent or the Borrower in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were
correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender
or the L/C Issuer hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, under this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any amount due to
the Administrative Agent under this clause (ii).  (d) Evidence of Payments. Upon request by the Borrower or
the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, after any payment of Taxes by the Borrower or by the Administrative Agent to a Governmental Authority as provided in this Section 3.01, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent
or the Administrative Agent shall deliver to the Borrower, as the case may be, the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of any return required by Laws to report such payment
or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be. 
(e) Status of Lenders; Tax Documentation. 
(i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any
Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower
or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other
documentation prescribed by applicable Law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or
information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in
Section 3.01(e)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lenders reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or
expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.  (ii) Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, in the event that the Borrower is a U.S. Person, 
  48 


(A) any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9
certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax;  (B) any Foreign Lender shall, to the
extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement
(and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable: 
(I) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party
(x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the interest
article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the
business profits or other income article of such tax treaty;  (II) executed originals of IRS Form
W-8ECI;  (III) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under
Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit F-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a bank within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a 10 percent
shareholder of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a controlled foreign corporation described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate)
and (y) executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN; or  (IV) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner,
executed originals of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit F-2 or Exhibit F-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other
certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such
Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit F-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner; 
(C) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative
Agent (in such number of 
  49 



copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable
request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable Law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such
supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable Law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and 
(D) if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if
such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent
at the time or times prescribed by Law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable Law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code)
and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has
complied with such Lenders obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (D), FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the Closing
Date.  (iii) Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered pursuant to this
Section 3.01 expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so. 
(f) Treatment of Certain Refunds. Unless required by applicable Laws, at no time shall the Administrative Agent have any
obligation to file for or otherwise pursue on behalf of a Lender or the L/C Issuer, or have any obligation to pay to any Lender or the L/C Issuer, any refund of Taxes withheld or deducted from funds paid for the account of such Lender or the L/C
Issuer, as the case may be. If any Recipient determines, in its reasonable discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes (including any application or carry-over of such refund amount to reduce any amount otherwise
payable to the refunding Governmental Authority) as to which it has been indemnified by an indemnifying party or with respect to which it has been paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 3.01, it shall pay to the indemnifying
party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, under this Section 3.01 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses (including Taxes) incurred by such Recipient, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund), provided that such indemnifying party, upon the request of the Recipient,
agrees to repay the amount paid over to such indemnifying party (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Recipient in the event the Recipient is required to repay such refund to such
Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this subsection, in no event will the applicable Recipient be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this subsection the payment of which would place the
Recipient in a less favorable net after-Tax position than such Recipient would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving 
  50 



rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This subsection shall
not be construed to require any Recipient to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person. 
(g) Survival. Each partys obligations under this Section 3.01 shall survive the resignation or
replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender or the L/C Issuer, the termination of the Revolving Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other Obligations. 
3.02 Illegality. If any Lender reasonably determines that any Change in Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental
Authority has asserted after the Closing Date that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to the Eurodollar Rate, or to determine or charge interest
rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the London interbank market, then, on notice thereof by
such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, (i) any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Eurodollar Rate Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended, and (ii) if such notice
asserts the illegality of such Lender making or maintaining Base Rate Committed Revolving Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate, the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of
such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate, in each case until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the
Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist (which notice such Lender agrees to give promptly). Upon receipt of such notice, (x) the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the
Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all Eurodollar Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the
Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans to such day, or
immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate, the Administrative
Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the Eurodollar Rate component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer
illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted. 
3.03 Inability to Determine Rates. 
(a) If in connection with any request for a Eurodollar Rate Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof, (i) the
Administrative Agent determines that (A) Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in the London interbank eurodollar market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Eurodollar Rate Loan, or (B) adequate and reasonable
means do not exist for determining the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan or in connection with an existing or proposed Base Rate Loan (in each case with respect to clause (i),
Impacted Loans), or (ii) the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders determine that for any reason the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan does not adequately and
fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Eurodollar Rate Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, (x) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain

  51 



Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected Eurodollar Rate Loans or Interest Periods), and (y) in the event of a determination described in the preceding
sentence with respect to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate, the utilization of the Eurodollar Rate component in determining the Base Rate shall be suspended, in each case until the Administrative Agent revokes such notice (which the
Administrative Agent agrees promptly to do upon determination by the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist). Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending
request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans (to the extent of the affected Eurodollar Rate Loans or Interest Periods) or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a
Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.  (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Administrative
Agent has made the determination described in clause (a)(i) of this Section, the Administrative Agent, in consultation with the Borrower and the affected Lenders, may establish an alternative interest rate for the Impacted Loans, in which case, such
alternative rate of interest shall apply with respect to the Impacted Loans until (1) the Administrative Agent revokes the notice delivered with respect to the Impacted Loans under clause (a)(i) of this Section, (2) the Administrative
Agent or the Required Lenders notify the Borrower that such alternative interest rate does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding the Impacted Loans, or (3) any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful,
or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to such alternative rate of interest or to determine or
charge interest rates based upon such rate or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to do any of the foregoing and provides the Administrative Agent and the Borrower written notice thereof. 
3.04 Increased Costs. 
(a) Increased Costs Generally. If any Change in Law shall: 
(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement
against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement contemplated by Section 3.04(e)) or the L/C Issuer; 
(ii) subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses
(b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital
attributable thereto); or  (iii) impose on any Lender or the L/C Issuer or the London interbank market any other condition,
cost or expense affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Rate Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;  and the result of
any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Loan the interest on which is determined by reference to the Eurodollar Rate (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such
Loan), or to increase the cost to such Lender or the L/C Issuer of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of Credit), or to reduce the amount of any
sum received 
  52 



or receivable by such Lender or the L/C Issuer hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender or the L/C Issuer, the Borrower will pay to such
Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered; provided that the Borrower shall
not be liable for such compensation if (x) the relevant Change in Law occurs on a date prior to the date such Lender becomes a party hereto or (y) such Lender invokes Section 3.02. 
(b) Capital Requirements. If any Lender or the L/C Issuer determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or the
L/C Issuer or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lenders or the L/C Issuers holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lenders or
the L/C Issuers capital or on the capital of such Lenders or the L/C Issuers holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Revolving Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters
of Credit or Swing Line Loans held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the L/C Issuer, to a level below that which such Lender or the L/C Issuer or such Lenders or the L/C Issuers holding company could have achieved but
for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lenders or the L/C Issuers policies and the policies of such Lenders or the L/C Issuers holding company with respect to capital adequacy and liquidity), then from time to
time the Borrower will pay to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer or such Lenders or the L/C Issuers holding company for any such reduction
suffered.  (c) Certificates for Reimbursement. A certificate of a Lender or the L/C Issuer setting forth the amount
or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) of this Section, setting forth in reasonable detail the manner in which such amount or
amounts was determined and delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within ten (10) days after
receipt thereof.  (d) Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the L/C Issuer to demand
compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lenders or the L/C Issuers right to demand such compensation, provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a
Lender or the L/C Issuer pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than one hundred and eighty (180) days prior to the date that such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case
may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lenders or the L/C Issuers intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such
increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the one hundred and eighty (180) day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof). 
(e) Reserves on Eurodollar Rate Loans. The Borrower shall pay to each Lender, as long as such Lender shall be required
to maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including eurocurrency funds or deposits (currently known as Eurocurrency liabilities), additional interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Eurodollar
Rate Loan equal to the actual costs of such reserves allocated to such Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive), which shall be due and payable on each date on which interest is
payable on such Loan; provided the Borrower shall have received at least ten (10) days prior written notice (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of such additional interest or costs from such Lender. If a Lender fails to give written
notice ten (10) days prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date, such additional interest shall be due and payable ten (10) days from receipt of such notice. 
  53 


3.05 Compensation for Losses. Within ten (10) days of written demand by any
Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense (other than loss of profit) incurred by it as a result of: 
(a) any conversion, payment or prepayment of any Eurodollar Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period
for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise);  (b) any failure by the
Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Eurodollar Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower; or 
(c) any assignment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a
request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 10.13;  including any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds
obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained. The Borrower shall also pay any customary administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing. 
For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under this Section 3.05, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded
each Eurodollar Rate Loan made by it at the Eurodollar Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the London interbank eurodollar market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Eurodollar Rate
Loan was in fact so funded.  3.06 Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders. 
(a) Designation of a Different Lending Office. Each Lender may make any Loan to the Borrower through any Lending Office,
provided that the exercise of this option shall not affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Loan in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.04, or the Borrower is
required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender, the L/C Issuer or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender or the L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 3.01, or if any Lender gives a notice pursuant to
Section 3.02, then at the request of the Borrower such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as applicable, shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different Lending Office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and
obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as applicable, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to
Section 3.01 or 3.04, as the case may be, in the future, or eliminate the need for the notice pursuant to Section 3.02, as applicable, and (ii) in each case, would not subject such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the
case may be, to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in
connection with any such designation or assignment.  (b) Replacement of Lenders. If any Lender requests compensation
under Section 3.04 or gives a notice pursuant to Section 3.02, or if the Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender
pursuant to Section 3.01, and, in each case, such Lender has declined or is unable to designate a different lending office in with Section 3.06(a), the Borrower may replace such Lender in accordance with
Section 10.13. 
  54 


3.07 Survival. All of the Borrowers obligations under this Article III
shall survive termination of the Revolving Commitments and repayment of all other Obligations hereunder and resignation of the Administrative Agent. 
ARTICLE IV 
CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO CREDIT EXTENSIONS 
4.01 Conditions of Initial Credit Extension. The effectiveness of this Agreement and the obligation of the L/C Issuer and each
Lender to make its initial Credit Extension hereunder is subject to satisfaction of the following conditions precedent:

IX  ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT 
9.01 Appointment and Authority. 
Each of the Lenders and the L/C Issuer hereby irrevocably appoints Bank of America to act on its behalf as the Administrative Agent hereunder
and under the other Loan Documents and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such actions and
powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The provisions of this Article (other than Section 9.06) are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuer, and the Borrower shall not have rights as a
third party beneficiary of any of such provisions. It is understood and agreed that the use of the term agent herein or in any other Loan Documents (or any other similar term) with reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to
connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable Law. Instead such term is used as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship
between contracting parties. 
  72 


9.02 Rights as a Lender. The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder
shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent and the term Lender or Lenders shall, unless otherwise expressly
indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, own securities of, act as the
financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and without any duty to
account therefor to the Lenders or to provide notice to or consent of the Lenders with respect thereto.  9.03 Exculpatory
Provisions. The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents and its duties hereunder shall be administrative in nature. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent:  (a) shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless
of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing;  (b) shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or
exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such
other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents), provided that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its
counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable Law, including for the avoidance of doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any Debtor Relief Law or that
may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any Debtor Relief Law; and 
(c) shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not
be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of their Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. 
Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its Related Parties shall be liable for any action taken or not taken by the Administrative Agent
under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall
be necessary, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Sections 10.01 and 8.02) or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct
as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment. Any such action taken or failure to act pursuant to the foregoing shall be binding on all Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge
of any Default unless and until notice describing such Default is given in writing to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower, a Lender or the L/C Issuer. 
Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its Related Parties have any duty or obligation to any Lender or participant or any other Person
to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or
thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default, (iv) the validity,

  73 



enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in
Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent. 
9.04 Reliance by Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall be fully protected in
relying and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, communication, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other
distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been
made by the proper Person, and shall be fully protected in relying and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, or the issuance, extension, renewal or increase
of a Letter of Credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or the L/C Issuer, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender or the L/C Issuer unless the Administrative Agent
shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender or the L/C Issuer prior to the making of such Loan or the issuance, extension, renewal or increase of such Letter of Credit. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may
be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts. 
9.05 Delegation of Duties. The Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers
hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such
sub-agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of
the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any sub-agents except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction
determines in a final and non appealable judgment that the Administrative Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such sub-agents. 
9.06 Resignation of Administrative Agent. 
(a) The Administrative Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders, the L/C Issuer and the Borrower.
Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, with the consent of the Borrower (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), to appoint a successor, which shall be a bank with an office in the United
States, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days after the retiring
Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders and the Borrower) (the Resignation Effective Date), then the retiring Administrative Agent may (but shall not be
obligated to) on behalf of the Lenders and the L/C Issuer, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above (including the consent of the Borrower). Whether or not a successor has been appointed, such resignation
shall become effective in accordance with such notice on the Resignation Effective Date. 
  74 


(b) If the Person serving as Administrative Agent is a Defaulting Lender, the
Required Lenders may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, by notice in writing to the Borrower and such Person remove such Person as Administrative Agent and, with the consent of the Borrower (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed),
appoint a successor. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders and the Borrower)
(the Removal Effective Date), then such removal shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice on the Removal Effective Date. 
(c) With effect from the Resignation Effective Date or the Removal Effective Date (as applicable) (i) the retiring or
removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (except that in the case of any collateral security held by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders or the L/C
Issuer under any of the Loan Documents, the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall continue to hold such collateral security until such time as a successor Administrative Agent is appointed) and (ii) except for any indemnity payments or
other amounts then owed to the retiring or removed Administrative Agent, all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender and the L/C Issuer
directly, until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided for above (including the consent of the Borrower). Upon the acceptance of a successors appointment as Administrative Agent
hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or removed) Administrative Agent (other than as provided in Section 3.01(g) and other than any rights to
indemnity payments or other amounts owed to the retiring or removed Administrative Agent as of the Resignation Effective Date or the Removal Effective Date, as applicable), and the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from
all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this Section). The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those
payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After the retiring or removed Administrative Agents resignation or removal hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article

Assignee Group and concurrent assignments from members of an Assignee Group to a single Eligible Assignee (or to an Eligible Assignee and members of its Assignee Group) will be treated as a
single assignment for purposes of determining whether such minimum amount has been met.  (ii) Proportionate Amounts.
Each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lenders Loans and Commitments, and rights and obligations with respect thereto, assigned, except that this clause (ii) shall not
(A) apply to the Swing Line Lenders rights and obligations in respect of Swing Line Loans or (B) prohibit any Lender from assigning all or a portion of its rights and obligations in respect of its Revolving Commitment (and the
related Committed Revolving Loans thereunder) on a non-pro rata basis.  (iii) Required Consents. No consent shall be
required for any assignment except to the extent required by subsection (b)(i)(B) of this Section and, in addition:  (A)
the consent of the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required unless (1) an Event of Default under Section 8.01(a), (f) or (g) has occurred and is continuing at the
time of such assignment or (2) such assignment is to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund; provided, further, that the Borrower shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment requiring its consent under this clause
(A) unless it shall object thereto by written notice to the Administrative Agent within ten (10) Business Days after having received written notice thereof; 
(B) the consent of the Administrative Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required if
such assignment is to a Person that is not a Lender, an Affiliate of such Lender or an Approved Fund with respect to such Lender; and 
(C) the consent of the L/C Issuer and the Swing Line Lender shall be required for any assignment in respect of Committed
Revolving Loans and Revolving Commitments.  (iv) Assignment and Assumption. The parties to each assignment shall
execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee in the amount of Three Thousand Five Hundred and No/100 Dollars ($3,500.00) payable by the assignor; provided,
however, that the Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, elect to waive such processing and recordation fee in the case of any assignment. The assignee, if it is not a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an
Administrative Questionnaire.  (v) No Assignment to Certain Persons. No such assignment shall be made (A) to
the Borrower or any Affiliates or Subsidiaries of the Borrower or (B) to any Defaulting Lender or any of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries or to any Person who, upon becoming a Lender hereunder, would constitute one of the foregoing Persons
described in this clause (B).  (vi) No Assignment to Natural Persons. No such assignment shall be made to a natural
person. 
  85 


(vii) Certain Additional Payments. In connection with any assignment of
rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments to the
Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with
the consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Loans previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to
(x) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or any Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon) and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full
pro rata share of all Loans and participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans in accordance with its Applicable Percentage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender
hereunder shall become effective under applicable Law without compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance
occurs.  Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection (c) of this Section, from and after the
effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under
this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all
of the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04, 3.05, and 10.04 with
respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment; provided, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no assignment by a Defaulting Lender will constitute a waiver or
release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lenders having been a Defaulting Lender. Upon request, the Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and deliver a Note to the assignee Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender
of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this subsection shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with subsection
(d) of this Section.  (c) Register. The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the
Borrower (and such agency solely for tax purposes), shall maintain at the Administrative Agents Office a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it (or the equivalent thereof in electronic form) and a register for the recordation
of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Revolving Commitments of, and principal amounts (and stated interest) of the Loans and L/C Obligations owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the
Register). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof
as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior
notice. 
  86 


(d) Participations. Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or
notice to, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural Person, a Defaulting Lender or the Borrower or any of the Borrowers Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a
Participant) in all or a portion of such Lenders rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Revolving Commitment and/or the Loans (including such Lenders participations in L/C
Obligations and/or Swing Line Loans) owing to it); provided that (i) such Lenders obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the
performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuer shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lenders rights and obligations under this
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, each Lender shall be responsible for the indemnity under Section 10.04(c) without regard to the existence of any participation. 
Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right
to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree
to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in Section 10.01(a) through (f) that affects such Participant. The Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01,
3.04 and 3.05 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section (it being understood that the documentation required under Section 3.01(e)
shall be delivered to the Lender who sells the participation) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section; provided that such Participant (A) agrees to be
subject to the provisions of Sections 3.06 and 10.13 as if it were an assignee under paragraph (b) of this Section and (B) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 3.01 or 3.04, with
respect to any participation, than the Lender from whom it acquired the applicable participation would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after
the Participant acquired the applicable participation. Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at the Borrowers request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrower to effectuate the provisions of
Section 3.06 with respect to any Participant. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.08 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be
subject to Section 2.13 as though it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of
each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participants interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the Participant Register); provided that no Lender shall have
any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participants interest in any Revolving Commitments, Loans, Letters of Credit or its other
Obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Revolving Commitment, Loan, Letter of Credit or other Obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of
the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation
for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register. 
(e) Certain Pledges. Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights
under this Agreement (including under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such
Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. 
  87 


(f) Resignation as L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender after Assignment.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if at any time Bank of America assigns all of its Revolving Commitment and Loans pursuant to subsection (b) above, Bank of America may, (i) upon thirty (30) calendar
days notice to the Borrower and the Lenders, resign as L/C Issuer and/or (ii) upon thirty (30) calendar days notice to the Borrower, resign as Swing Line Lender. In the event of any such resignation as L/C Issuer or Swing Line
Lender, the Borrower shall be entitled to appoint from among the Lenders a successor L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender hereunder; provided, however, that no failure by the Borrower to appoint any such successor shall affect the
resignation of Bank of America as L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender, as the case may be. If Bank of America resigns as L/C Issuer, it shall retain all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the L/C Issuer hereunder with respect to all Letters of
Credit outstanding as of the effective date of its resignation as L/C Issuer and all L/C Obligations with respect thereto (including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Committed Revolving Loans or fund risk participations in
Unreimbursed Amounts pursuant to Section 2.03(c)). If Bank of America resigns as Swing Line Lender, it shall retain all the rights of the Swing Line Lender provided for hereunder with respect to Swing Line Loans made by it and
outstanding as of the effective date of such resignation, including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Committed Revolving Loans or fund risk participations in outstanding Swing Line Loans pursuant to Section 2.04(c).
Upon the appointment of a successor L/C Issuer and/or Swing Line Lender, (a) such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender, as the case
may be, and (b) the successor L/C Issuer shall issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession or make other arrangements reasonably satisfactory to Bank of America to
effectively assume the obligations of Bank of America with respect to such Letters of Credit.  10.07 Treatment of Certain
Information; Confidentiality. Each of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuer agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its Affiliates
and to its Related Parties (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the extent required
or requested by any regulatory authority purporting to have jurisdiction over such Person or its Related Parties, including any self-regulatory authority, such as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (in which case such Administrative
Agent, Lender or L/C Issuer shall (i) except with respect to any audit or examination conducted by bank accountants or any Governmental Authority exercising examination or regulatory authority, to the extent permitted by Law, endeavor to notify
the Borrower promptly in advance thereof, and in any event, as soon as practical and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that any such Information so disclosed is accorded confidential treatment), (c) to the extent required
by applicable Laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process (in which case such Administrative Agent, Lender or L/C Issuer shall (i) to the extent permitted by Law, endeavor to inform the Borrower promptly in advance thereof,
and in any event, as soon as practical and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that any such Information so disclosed is accorded confidential treatment), (d) to any other party hereto, (e) to the extent reasonably
necessary or advisable, in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or under any other Loan Document or any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder or
thereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section, to (i) any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights and obligations
under this Agreement or any Eligible Assignee invited to become a 
  88 



Lender pursuant to Section 2.14(c) or (ii) any actual or prospective party (or its Related Parties) to any swap, derivative or other transaction under which payments are to be
made by reference to the Borrower and its obligations, this Agreement or payments hereunder, (g) on a confidential basis to (i) any rating agency in connection with rating the Borrower or the credit facilities provided hereunder (provided
that any such disclosure shall be made in consultation with the Borrower) or (ii) the CUSIP Service Bureau or any similar agency in connection with the issuance and monitoring of CUSIP numbers or other market identifiers with respect to the
credit facilities provided hereunder, (h) with the consent of the Borrower, (i) to the extent such Information (x) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section or (y) becomes available to the
Administrative Agent, any Lender, the L/C Issuer or any of their respective Affiliates on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrower or (j) to data service providers, including league table providers, that serve the lending
industry.  For purposes of this Section, Information means all information received from or on behalf of the Borrower
or any Subsidiary of the Borrower relating to the Borrower or any Subsidiary of the Borrower or any of their respective businesses, other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer on a
nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the Borrower or a Subsidiary of the Borrower or any of their representatives. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have
complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information. 
Each of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuer acknowledges that (a) the Information may include material non-public
information concerning the Borrower or a Subsidiary of the Borrower, as the case may be, (b) it has developed compliance procedures regarding the use of material non-public information and (c) it will handle such material non-public
information in accordance with applicable Law, including United States Federal and state securities Laws.  10.08 Right of
Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing (but subject to the provisions of Section 10.03), each Lender, the L/C Issuer and each of their respective Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from
time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, in whatever currency) at any time held and other obligations (in whatever currency)
at any time owing by such Lender, the L/C Issuer or any such Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower against any and all of the obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Agreement or any other Loan
Document to such Lender or the L/C Issuer or their respective Affiliates, irrespective of whether or not such Lender, the L/C Issuer or such Affiliate shall have made any demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and although such
obligations of the Borrower may be contingent or unmatured or are owed to a branch or office or Affiliate of such Lender or the L/C Issuer different from the branch or office or Affiliate holding such deposit or obligated on such indebtedness;
provided, that in the event that any Defaulting Lender shall exercise any such right of setoff, (x) all amounts so set off shall be paid over immediately to the Administrative Agent for further application in accordance with the provisions of
Section 2.16 and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and the Lenders, and (y) the Defaulting
Lender shall provide promptly to the Administrative Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the Obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as to which it exercised such right of setoff. The rights of each Lender, the L/C Issuer, the Swing
Line Lender and their respective Affiliates under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that such Lender, the L/C Issuer or their respective Affiliates may have. Each Lender and the L/C Issuer
agrees to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent promptly after any such setoff and application; provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application. 
  89 


10.09 Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in any Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid under the Loan Documents shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious interest permitted by applicable Law (the Maximum Rate). If the Administrative Agent or any Lender
shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the Borrower. In determining whether the interest contracted
for, charged, or received by the Administrative Agent or a Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather
than interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the Obligations hereunder.
 10.10 Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties
hereto in different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement and the other Loan Documents constitute the entire contract among the parties
relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the
Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof that, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this
Agreement by telecopy or other electronic imaging means shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement. 
10.11 Survival of Representations and Warranties. All representations and warranties made hereunder and in any other Loan
Document or other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and thereof. Such representations and warranties have been or will be relied upon by the
Administrative Agent and each Lender, regardless of any investigation made by the Administrative Agent or any Lender or on their behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default
at the time of any Credit Extension, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as any Loan or any other Obligation hereunder shall remain unpaid or unsatisfied or any Letter of Credit shall remain outstanding. 
10.12 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents is held to be illegal, invalid or
unenforceable, (a) the legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall not be affected or impaired thereby and (b) the parties shall endeavor in good faith negotiations
to replace the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions. The invalidity of a provision in a particular
jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this Section 10.12, if and to the extent that the enforceability of any provisions in this
Agreement relating to Defaulting Lenders shall be limited by Debtor Relief Laws, as determined in good faith by the Administrative Agent or the L/C Issuer, as applicable, then such provisions shall be deemed to be in effect only to the extent not so
limited.  10.13 Replacement of Lenders. If (i) any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.04 or gives
a notice pursuant to Section 3.02, (ii) the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.01, (iii) a Lender (a
Non-Consenting Lender) does not consent to a proposed amendment, change, waiver, discharge or termination with respect to any Loan Document that has been approved by the Required Lenders as provided in Section 10.01
but requires unanimous consent of all Lenders or all Lenders 
  90 



directly affected thereby (as applicable) or (iv) any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative
Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate (and such Lender shall be obligated to assign and delegate), without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 10.06),
all of its interests, rights (other than its existing rights to payments pursuant to Sections 3.01 and 3.04) and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an Eligible Assignee that shall assume such obligations
(which Eligible Assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment), provided that:  (a) with
respect to any assignment, the Borrower shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the assignment fee specified in Section 10.06(b); 
(b) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding par principal amount of its Loans
and L/C Advances, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under Section 3.05) from the Eligible Assignee (to the extent of such
outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees), in the case of an assignment, or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts); 
(c) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 3.04 or payments
required to be made pursuant to Section 3.01, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter; 
(d) in the case of an assignment, such assignment does not conflict with applicable Laws; and 
(e) in the case of an assignment resulting from a Lender becoming a Non-Consenting Lender, the applicable assignee shall have
consented to the applicable amendment, waiver or consent.  A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if,
prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. 
10.14 Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Etc. 
(a) GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS (EXCEPT, AS TO ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT, AS EXPRESSLY SET

Administrative Agent nor any Arranger or Lender has any obligation to the Borrower or any of its respective Affiliates with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby except those obligations expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan

the Administrative Agent, or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may
