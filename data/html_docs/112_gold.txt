any Restricted Subsidiary since the beginning of the applicable Test Period) shall have made any Specified Transaction that would have required adjustment pursuant to this Section 1.3, then the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio,
Consolidated First Lien Leverage Ratio, Consolidated Secured Leverage Ratio and the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio shall be calculated giving Pro Forma Effect thereto for such Test Period as if such Specified Transaction had occurred at the
beginning of such Test Period.  (b)    Whenever Pro Forma Effect is to be given to a Specified Transaction, the pro
forma calculations shall be made in good faith by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Borrower (and may include, without duplication, reasonably identifiable and factually supportable cost savings, operating expense reductions and
synergies resulting from such Specified Transaction which is being given Pro Forma Effect that have been or are expected to be realized (calculated on a pro forma basis as though such cost savings, operating expense reductions and synergies had been
realized during the entirety of the applicable period)). If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is being given Pro Forma Effect, the interest on such Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in effect on the date of
determination had been the applicable rate for the entire period (taking into account for such entire period, any Hedging Obligation applicable to such Indebtedness); provided that, in the case of repayment of any Indebtedness, to the extent
actual interest related thereto was included during all or any portion of the applicable Test Period, the actual interest may be used for the applicable portion of such Test Period. Interest on a Capital Lease Obligation shall be deemed to accrue at
an interest rate reasonably determined by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Borrower to be the rate of interest implicit in such Capital Lease Obligation in accordance with GAAP. For purposes of making the computation referred to
above, interest on any Indebtedness under a revolving credit facility computed on a Pro Forma Basis shall be computed based upon the average daily balance of such Indebtedness during the applicable period (or, if lower, the greater of
(i) maximum commitments under such revolving credit facilities as of the date of determination and (ii) the aggregate principal amount of loans outstanding under such a revolving credit facilities on such date). Interest on Indebtedness
that may optionally be determined at an interest rate based upon a factor of a prime or similar rate, a eurocurrency interbank offered rate, or other rate, shall be deemed to have been based upon the rate actually chosen, or, if none, then based
upon such optional rate chosen as the Borrower may designate.

In connection with any action being taken solely in connection with a Limited Condition
Acquisition, for purposes of:  (i)    determining compliance with any provision of this Agreement which
requires the calculation of the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio;  (ii)    determining the accuracy of
representations and warranties in Article IV, the permissibility of such Limited Condition Acquisition under Article VII and/or whether a Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing under Article VIII; or 
(iii)    testing availability under baskets set forth in this Agreement (including baskets measured as a
percentage of Consolidated EBITDA or Consolidated Total Assets);  in each case, at the option of the Borrower (the Borrowers election to exercise
such option in connection with any Limited Condition Acquisition, an LCA Election), the date of determination of whether any such action is permitted hereunder, shall be deemed to be the date the definitive agreements for such
Limited Condition Acquisition are entered into (the LCA Test Date), and if, after giving Pro Forma Effect to the Limited Condition Acquisition and the other transactions to be entered into in connection therewith (including any
incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) as if they had occurred at the beginning of the most recent Test Period ending prior to the LCA Test Date, the Borrower could have taken such action on the relevant LCA Test Date in
compliance with such ratio or basket, without any such representation or warrantee being inaccurate in all material respects (or, if required, in all respects) on the applicable date and without the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default,
such ratio or basket shall be deemed to have been complied with, and any requirements to bring down any representations and warranties, to satisfy any covenant and/or for the absence of any Default or Event of Default shall be deemed to have been
complied with. If the Borrower has made an LCA Election and any of the ratios or baskets for which compliance was determined or tested as of the LCA Test Date are exceeded as a result of fluctuations in any such ratio or basket, including due to
fluctuations in Consolidated EBITDA of the Borrower or the Person subject to such Limited Condition Acquisition, at or prior to the consummation of the relevant transaction or action, such baskets or ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded
as a result of such fluctuations. If the Borrower has made an LCA Election for any Limited Condition Acquisition, then in connection with any subsequent calculation of any ratio or basket availability with respect to the incurrence of Indebtedness
or Liens, or the making of Restricted Payments, mergers, the conveyance, lease or other transfer of all or substantially all of the consolidated total assets of the Borrower, the prepayment, redemption, purchase, defeasance or other satisfaction of
Indebtedness, or the designation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary on or following the relevant LCA Test Date and prior to the earlier of (i) the date on which such Limited Condition Acquisition is consummated or (ii) the date that the
definitive agreement for such Limited Condition Acquisition is terminated or expires without consummation of such Limited Condition Acquisition, any such ratio or basket shall be calculated on a Pro Forma Basis assuming such Limited Condition
Acquisition and other transactions in connection therewith (including any incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) have been consummated. 
(c)    [Reserved.]. 
(d)    Any determination of Consolidated Total Assets shall be made by reference to the last day of the Test Period most
recently ended on or prior to the relevant date of determination.  (e)    Except as otherwise specifically provided
herein, all computations of Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio and other financial ratios and financial calculations (and all definitions (including accounting terms) used in determining any of the foregoing)
and all computations and all definitions (including accounting terms) used in determining compliance with Section 7.1 shall be calculated, in each case, with respect to the Borrower and the Restricted Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. 
  39 




(f)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, all
leases of any Person that are or would have been characterized as operating leases in accordance with GAAP immediately prior to the Closing Date (whether or not such leases were in effect on such date) shall be accounted for as operating leases (and
not as Capital Leases) for purposes of this Agreement regardless of any change in GAAP following the Closing Date that would otherwise require such leases to be recharacterized as Capital Leases, and any determination of whether a lease is a Capital
Lease or an operating lease shall exclude the effect of the adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02 by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (ASU
2016-02) or any related promulgation or accounting standards such that Capital Leases and Capital Lease Obligations shall specifically exclude liabilities that were considered
operating lease liabilities under GAAP prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-02 or any related promulgation or accounting standard, and all calculations and deliverables under this Agreement or any other Loan
Document shall be made or delivered, as applicable, without giving effect thereto, and, without limitation of the generality if the foregoing, all such leases shall be treated as operating leases for the purpose of calculating Consolidated EBITDA,
the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio and any other financial definition or ratio in any Loan Document. All Capital Leases that were assumed by the Borrower or a Restricted Subsidiary in connection with the Acquisition or any Permitted Acquisition
or other Investment or were in existence at the time any Person became a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of the Acquisition or a Permitted Acquisition or other Investment (and not, in each case, incurred or created in contemplation of the
Acquisition or Permitted Acquisition or other Investment) shall be treated as operating leases for the purpose of calculating Consolidated EBITDA, the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio and any other financial definition or ratio in any Loan Document
and Capital Leases and Capital Lease Obligations shall specifically exclude liabilities thereunder. 
(g)    In the event that any Indebtedness, Lien, Restricted Payment, Investment or payment of junior or unsecured
Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of permitted Indebtedness, Lien, Restricted Payment, Investment or debt payment described in Section 7.2, Section 7.3, Section 7.6, Section 7.8, or
Section 7.9, respectively, at the time of incurrence, the Borrower will be entitled to divide and classify Indebtedness, Liens, Restricted Payments, Investments or debt payments, as the case may be, among the relevant categories of permitted
Indebtedness, Lien, Restricted Payment, Investment or debt payment, as the case may be.  SECTION 1.4 Currencies. 
(a)    For purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, where the permissibility of a transaction or
determinations of required actions or circumstances depend upon compliance with, or are determined by reference to, amounts stated in Dollars, any requisite currency translation shall be based on the rate of exchange between the applicable currency
and Dollars (as quoted by the Administrative Agent or if the Administrative Agent does not quote a rate of exchange on such currency, by a known dealer in such currency reasonably acceptable to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent) in effect on
the Business Day immediately preceding the date of such transaction or determination and shall not be affected by subsequent fluctuations in exchange rates. 
(b)    The Borrower may from time to time request that Letters of Credit be issued in a currency other than Dollars, AUD,
Euro or Sterling; provided that such requested currency is a lawful currency (other than Dollars, AUD, Euro or Sterling) that is readily available and freely transferable and convertible into Dollars. Such request shall be subject to the
approval of the applicable Issuing Lenders. 
  40 




(c)    Any such request shall be made to the Administrative Agent and
the Issuing Lender not later than 11:00 a.m., 10 days prior to the requested date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or such other time or date as may be agreed by the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Lender, in their sole discretion).
Each applicable Issuing Lender shall notify the Administrative Agent, not later than 11:00 a.m., five days after receipt of such request whether it consents, in its sole discretion, to the issuance of Letters of Credit in such requested currency.
 (d)    Any failure by an Issuing Lender to respond to such request within the time period specified in the preceding
paragraph shall be deemed to be a refusal by such Issuing Lender to issue Letters of Credit in such requested currency. If the Administrative Agent and the applicable Issuing Lender agree to the issuance of Letters of Credit in such requested
currency, the Administrative Agent shall so notify the Borrower and the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall amend this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as necessary to accommodate such Letters of Credit (as applicable). This
Section 1.4 shall supersede anything to the contrary herein, including Section 10.1.  SECTION 1.5 Cashless
Rollovers. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document, to the extent that any Lender extends the maturity date of, or replaces, renews or refinances, any of its then-existing Loans with any
Incremental Facility, Loans under incurred pursuant to a Refinancing Amendment and/or loans incurred under a new credit facility, in each case, to the extent such extension, replacement, renewal or refinancing is effected by means of a
cashless roll by such Lender, such extension, replacement, renewal or refinancing shall be deemed to comply with any requirement hereunder or any other Loan Document that such payment be made in Dollars, in immediately
available funds, in Cash or any other similar requirement.  ARTICLE II.    AMOUNT AND TERMS OF
COMMITMENTS  SECTION 2.1 Term Loan Commitments. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, each Tranche A Term Loan
Lender severally agrees to make a term loan (a Tranche A Term Loan) to the Borrower in Dollars on the Closing Date in an amount equal to the amount of the Tranche A Term Loan Commitment of such Lender. The Term Loans may from time
to time be LIBOR Loans or ABR Loans, as determined by the Borrower and notified to the Administrative Agent in accordance with Sections 2.2 and 2.13. 
SECTION 2.2 Procedure for Term Loan Borrowing. The Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent irrevocable (provided that
any such notice may be conditioned on the occurrence of a transaction and, if such condition is not satisfied on or prior to the date of such Borrowing, may be revoked by the Borrower in a written notice to the Administrative Agent) notice (which
notice must be received by the Administrative Agent (a) prior to 12:00 p.m. (Noon), Local Time, three Business Days prior to the Closing Date, in the case of LIBOR Loans or (b) prior to 12:00 p.m. (Noon), Local Time, one Business Day prior
to the Closing Date, in the case of ABR Loans or, in each case, such later date and time as the Administrative Agent may agree) requesting that the Tranche A Term Loan Lenders make the Tranche A Term Loans on the Closing Date and specifying the
amount to be borrowed. Such notice may be substantially in the form of Exhibit I or in such other form as the Borrower and the Administrative Agent may agree. Upon receipt of such notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Tranche A
Term Loan Lender thereof. Not later than 12:00 p.m. (Noon), Local Time, on the Closing Date each Tranche A Term Loan Lender shall make available to the Administrative Agent at the applicable Funding Office by wire transfer an amount in immediately
available funds equal to the Tranche A Term Loans to be made by such Lender. The Administrative Agent shall make available to the Borrower the aggregate of the amounts made available to the Administrative Agent by the Tranche A Term Loan Lenders in
immediately available funds by promptly remitting the amounts so received to the account of the Borrower specified by the Borrower in the applicable irrevocable notice specified above. 
  41 




SECTION 2.3 Repayment of Term Loans. (a) Subject to Sections 2.8(a), the
principal amount of each Tranche A Term Loan of each Tranche A Term Loan Lender shall mature in consecutive quarterly installments, each of which shall be in an amount equal to each Lenders Tranche A Term Loan Percentage multiplied by the
amount set forth below opposite such installment date (after giving effect to any reduction in such amount resulting from the application of prepayments made pursuant to Section 2.11 or 2.12); provided that if any such installment date
is not a Business Day, such installment payment shall be made on the last Business Day immediately preceding such installment date:

 All amounts outstanding
in respect of Tranche A Term
Loans
 (b)    The Incremental Term Loans of each Incremental Term Loan Lender shall mature in
consecutive installments (which shall be no more frequent than quarterly) as specified in the Increased Facility Activation Notice pursuant to which such Incremental Term Loans were made. 
SECTION 2.4 Revolving Credit Commitments. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, each Revolving Credit Lender
severally agrees to make revolving credit loans (Revolving Credit Loans) to the Borrower, in Dollars, from time to time during the Revolving Credit Commitment Period in an aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding
which, when added to the sum of such Lenders Revolving Credit Percentage of the L/C Obligations then outstanding, does not exceed the amount of such Lenders Revolving Credit Commitment; provided that the aggregate principal amount
of the Revolving Credit Loans borrowed on the Closing Date shall not exceed $50,000,000. During the Revolving Credit Commitment Period the Borrower may use the Revolving Credit Commitments by borrowing, prepaying the Revolving Credit Loans in whole
or in part, and reborrowing, all in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof. The Revolving Credit Loans in Dollars may from time to time be LIBOR Loans or ABR Loans, as determined by the Borrower and notified to the Administrative Agent in
accordance with Sections 2.5 and 2.13; provided that no Revolving Credit Loan shall be made as a LIBOR Loan after the day that is one month prior to the Revolving Credit Termination Date. 
  42 




(b)    The Borrowers shall repay all outstanding Revolving Credit Loans
on the Revolving Credit Termination Date.  SECTION 2.5 Procedure for Revolving Credit Borrowing. The Borrower may borrow under
the Revolving Credit Commitments during the Revolving Credit Commitment Period on any Business Day; provided that the Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent irrevocable (provided that any such notice may be conditioned on the
occurrence of a transaction and, if such condition is not satisfied on or prior to the date of such Borrowing, may be revoked by the Borrower in a written notice to the Administrative Agent) notice (which notice must be received by the
Administrative Agent (a) prior to 12:00 p.m. (Noon), Local Time, three Business Days prior to the requested Borrowing Date in the case of LIBOR Loans; or (b) prior to 10:00 a.m.., Local Time, on the requested Borrowing Date, in the case of
ABR Loans or, in each case, such later date and time as the Administrative Agent may agree), specifying (i) the amount and Type of Revolving Credit Loans to be borrowed, (ii) the requested Borrowing Date and (iii) in the case of any
LIBOR Loan and the length of the initial Interest Period therefor. Such notice may be substantially in the form of Exhibit I or in such other form as the Borrower and the Administrative Agent may agree. Each borrowing under the Revolving Credit
Commitments shall be in an amount equal to (x) in the case of ABR Loans, $1,000,000 or a whole multiple thereof (or, if the then aggregate Available Revolving Credit Commitments are less than $1,000,000, such lesser amount) and (y) in the
case of LIBOR Loans, the equivalent of $1,000,000 or a whole multiple of the equivalent of $1,000,000 in excess thereof. Upon receipt of any such notice from the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Revolving Credit Lender
thereof. Each Revolving Credit Lender will make the amount of its pro rata share of each borrowing available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Borrower at the applicable Funding Office prior to 12:00 p.m. (Noon), Local Time (or in
the case of LIBOR Loans, prior to 12:00 p.m. (Noon), Local Time), on the Borrowing Date requested by the Borrower in funds immediately available to the Administrative Agent. Such borrowing will then be made available to the Borrower by the
Administrative Agent crediting the account of the Borrower on the books of such office with the aggregate of the amounts made available to the Administrative Agent by the Revolving Credit Lenders and in like funds as received by the Administrative
Agent. Each Lender, at its option, may make any Loan by causing any domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of such Lender to make such Loan; provided that any exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay
such Loan in accordance with terms of this Agreement.  SECTION 2.6 [Reserved]. 
SECTION 2.7 [Reserved]. 
SECTION 2.8 Repayment of Loans. (a) The Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for
the account of the appropriate Revolving Credit Lender on the Revolving Credit Termination Date (or such earlier date on which the Loans become due and payable pursuant to Article VIII), the then unpaid principal amount of each Revolving Credit Loan
of such Revolving Credit Lender made to it and (ii) to the Administrative Agent for the account of the appropriate Term Loan Lender, the unpaid principal amount of each Term Loan of such Term Loan Lender made to it in installments according to
the amortization schedule set forth in Section 2.3 (or, in the case of any Incremental Term Loans, the amortization schedule set forth in the applicable Increased Facility Activation Notice) (or such earlier date on which the Loans become due
and payable pursuant to Article VIII) (subject to any reductions in such amount resulting from the application of prepayments made pursuant to Section 2.11 or 2.12). The Borrower hereby further agrees to pay interest on the unpaid principal
amount of the Loans from time to time outstanding from the date hereof until payment in full thereof at the rates per annum and on the dates set forth in Section 2.15. 
  43 




(b)    Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice
an account or accounts evidencing indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan of such Lender from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time under this
Agreement.  (c)    The Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Borrower, shall maintain the Register pursuant to
Section 10.6(b)(iv), and a subaccount therein for each Lender, in which shall be recorded (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder and any Note evidencing such Loan, the Type thereof and each Interest Period applicable thereto,
(ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) both the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder from the Borrower and
each Lenders share thereof.  (d)    The entries made in the Register and the accounts of each Lender maintained
pursuant to Section 2.8(b) shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law and absent manifest error, be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations of the Borrower therein recorded; provided, however,
that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain the Register or any such account, or any error therein, shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay (with applicable interest) the Loans made to the
Borrower by such Lender in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; provided, further, that in the event of any inconsistency between the accounts maintained by the Administrative Agent pursuant to paragraph (c) of this
Section and any Lenders records, the accounts of the Administrative Agent shall govern.  SECTION 2.9 Commitment Fees,
etc. (a) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Credit Lender a commitment fee for the period from and including the Closing Date to the date on which such Revolving Credit Lenders
Revolving Credit Commitments terminate or expire, computed at the Commitment Fee Rate on the average daily amount of the Available Revolving Credit Commitment of such Lender during the period for which payment is made, payable quarterly in arrears
on the last day of each March, June, September and December and on the date on which the applicable Revolving Credit Commitments terminate or expire, commencing on the first of such dates to occur after the date hereof. 
(b)    The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent the fees in the amounts and on the dates previously agreed to
in writing by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent.  SECTION 2.10 Termination or Reduction of Revolving Credit
Commitments. The Borrower shall have the right, upon not less than three Business Days notice to the Administrative Agent, to terminate the Revolving Credit Commitments or, from time to time, to reduce the amount of the Revolving Credit
Commitments (it being understood and agreed that any such notice may be conditioned on the occurrence of a transaction and, if such condition is not satisfied on or prior to the date of such termination or reduction, may be revoked by the Borrower
in a written notice to the Administrative Agent); provided that no such termination or reduction of Revolving Credit Commitments shall be permitted if, after giving effect thereto and to any prepayments of the Revolving Credit Loans made on
the effective date thereof, the Total Revolving Extensions of Credit would exceed the Total Revolving Credit Commitments. Any partial reduction shall be in an amount equal to $1,000,000, or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, and shall
reduce permanently the Revolving Credit Commitments then in effect.  SECTION 2.11 Optional Prepayments. The Borrower may at
any time and from time to time prepay the Loans, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, upon irrevocable (provided that any such notice may be conditioned on the occurrence of a transaction and, if such condition is not satisfied on
or prior to the date of such prepayment, may be revoked by the Borrower in a written notice 
  44 





to the Administrative Agent) notice delivered to the Administrative Agent (a) at least three Business Days prior thereto, in the case of LIBOR Loans denominated in Dollars, and (b) at
least one Business Day prior thereto, in the case of ABR Loans, which notice shall specify the date and amount of prepayment and whether the prepayment is of LIBOR Loans or ABR Loans; provided, that if a LIBOR Loan is prepaid on any day other
than the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, the Borrower shall also pay any amounts owing pursuant to Section 2.21. Upon receipt of any such notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each relevant Lender thereof. If
any such notice is given, the amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein, together with (except in the case of Revolving Credit Loans that are ABR Loans) accrued interest to such date on the amount
prepaid. Partial prepayments of Revolving Credit Loans shall be in an aggregate principal amount of $1,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof. Amounts to be applied in connection with prepayments of Term Loans made pursuant to
this Section 2.11 shall be applied to remaining installments of the Term Loans as directed by the Borrower.  SECTION
2.12 Mandatory Prepayments and Commitment Reductions. (a) If any Indebtedness shall be issued or incurred by the Borrower or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (excluding any Indebtedness issued or incurred in accordance with
Section 7.2 (other than Section 7.2(h))), an amount equal to 100% of the Net Cash Proceeds thereof shall be applied within five Business Days after such receipt thereof toward the prepayment of the Term Loans as set forth in
Section 2.12(d).  (b)    If on any date the Borrower or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries shall receive Net Cash
Proceeds from any Asset Sale or Recovery Event then, in each case, in excess of $2,500,000 in any single transaction or series of related transactions, unless a Reinvestment Notice shall be delivered in respect thereof, such Net Cash Proceeds shall
be applied within five Business Days after such receipt toward the prepayment of the Term Loans as set forth in Section 2.12(d); provided, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, on each Reinvestment Prepayment Date, an amount equal to the
Reinvestment Prepayment Amount with respect to the relevant Reinvestment Event shall be applied toward the prepayment of the Term Loans as set forth in Section 2.12(d). 
(c)    [Reserved]. 
(d)     To the extent that at any time the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Revolving Credit Loans and Letters
of Credit shall exceed the Total Revolving Credit Commitments then in effect, then the Borrower shall, within four Business Days, repay the Revolving Credit Loans to eliminate such excess. 
(e)    Amounts to be applied in connection with prepayments of Term Loans made pursuant to this Section 2.12 shall be
applied to remaining installments of the Term Loans as directed by the Borrower, or in the absence of such direction in the inverse order of maturity. Each prepayment of the Loans pursuant to this Section 2.12 shall be accompanied by accrued
interest to the date of such prepayment on the amount prepaid.  (f)    Notwithstanding any other provisions of this
Section 2.12, to the extent that any or all of the Net Cash Proceeds of any Asset Sale by a Foreign Subsidiary, the Net Cash Proceeds of any Recovery Event received by a Foreign Subsidiary attributable to a Foreign Subsidiary that is required
to be applied to prepay Term Loans pursuant to this Section 2.12 (i) would be prohibited or delayed by any applicable local law (including, without limitation, as a result of laws or regulations relating to financial assistance, corporate
benefit, restrictions on upstreaming of cash intragroup and fiduciary and statutory duties of directors of such Foreign Subsidiary) from being repatriated or passed on to or used for the benefit of the Borrower or any applicable Domestic Subsidiary
or conflict with the fiduciary duties of such Foreign Subsidiarys directors, or result in, or could reasonably be expected to result in, a material 
  45 





risk of personal or criminal liability for any officer, director, employee, manager, member of management or consultant of such Foreign Subsidiary (including on account of financial assistance,
corporate benefit, thin capitalization, capital maintenance or similar considerations) (provided that the Borrower shall take commercially reasonable actions available under local law to permit such repatriation) or (ii) repatriation of
such amount to the Borrower or any Subsidiary would result in material adverse tax consequences as determined in good faith by the Borrower (including, without limitation, as a result of any withholding of cash or the upstreaming of cash) with
respect to such amount, then in each case, the Borrower shall not be required to apply the portion of such Net Cash Proceeds so affected to prepay the Term Loans at the times provided in clause (b) of this Section 2.12 but may be retained
by the applicable Foreign Subsidiary so long as clause (i) or (ii) above is applicable, and once neither clause (i) nor clause (ii) above is applicable, such repatriation will be promptly effected and such repatriated Net Cash
Proceeds will be promptly (and in any event not later than five Business Days after such repatriation) applied (net of additional Taxes payable or reasonably estimated to be payable as a result thereof) to the prepayment of the Term Loans to the
extent required pursuant to this Section 2.12; provided that no such prepayment of the Term Loans pursuant to this Section 2.12 shall be required in the case of any such Net Cash Proceeds the repatriation of which the Borrower
believes in good faith would result in material adverse tax consequences, if on or before the date on which such Net Cash Proceeds so retained would otherwise have been required under this Section 2.12(f) to be applied to reinvestments or
prepayments pursuant to a Reinvestment Notice, the Borrower applies an amount equal to (x) the amount of such Net Cash Proceeds to such reinvestments or prepayments as if such Net Cash Proceeds had been received by the Borrower or a Domestic
Subsidiary rather than such Foreign Subsidiary, minus (y) the amount of additional Taxes that would have been payable or reserved against if such Net Cash Proceeds had been repatriated (or, if less, the Net Cash Proceeds that would be
calculated if received by such Foreign Subsidiary).  (g)    The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent in
writing of any mandatory prepayment of Term Loans required to be made pursuant to this Section 2.12 concurrently with or prior to the date of such prepayment. Each such notice shall specify the date of such prepayment and provide a reasonably
detailed calculation of the amount of such prepayment. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Lender holding Term Loans of the contents of such prepayment notice and of such Lenders pro rata share of the prepayment. Each Term Loan
Lender may reject all (but not less than all) of its pro rata share of any mandatory prepayment other than any such mandatory prepayment made in accordance with Section 2.12(a) (such declined amounts, the Declined
Proceeds) of Term Loans required to be made pursuant to this Section 2.12 by providing written notice (each, a Rejection Notice) to the Administrative Agent no later than 5:00 p.m., Local Time two Business Days
after the date of such Lenders receipt of notice from the Administrative Agent regarding such prepayment. If a Lender fails to deliver a Rejection Notice to the Administrative Agent within the time frame specified above, any such failure will
be deemed an acceptance of the total amount of such mandatory prepayment of Term Loans. Any Declined Proceeds shall be returned to the Borrower (at the Borrowers expense) to be retained by the Borrower. 
SECTION 2.13 Conversion and Continuation Options. (a) The Borrower may elect from time to time to convert LIBOR Loans denominated
in Dollars to ABR Loans by giving the Administrative Agent at least two Business Days prior irrevocable notice of such election; provided that any such conversion of LIBOR Loans may only be made on the last day of an Interest Period
with respect thereto. The Borrower may elect from time to time to convert ABR Loans to LIBOR Loans by giving the Administrative Agent at least three Business Days prior irrevocable notice of such election (which notice shall specify the length
of the initial Interest Period therefor); provided that no ABR Loan under a particular Facility may be converted into a LIBOR Loan (i) when any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent has, or the
Majority Facility Lenders in respect of such Facility have, determined in its or their sole discretion not to permit such conversions or (ii) after the date that is one month prior to the final scheduled termination or maturity date of such
Facility. Upon receipt of any such notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each relevant Lender thereof. 
  46 




(b)    Any LIBOR Loan may be continued as such upon the expiration of
the then current Interest Period with respect thereto by the Borrower (on its own behalf) giving irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent, in accordance with the applicable provisions of the term Interest Period set forth in
Section 1.1, of the length of the next Interest Period to be applicable to such Loans; provided that no LIBOR Loan under a particular Facility may be continued as such (i) when any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the
Administrative Agent has or the Majority Facility Lenders in respect of such Facility have determined in its or their sole discretion not to permit such continuations or (ii) after the date that is one month prior to the final scheduled
termination or maturity date of such Facility; and provided, further, that if the Borrower (on its own behalf) shall fail to give any required notice as described above in this paragraph or if such continuation is not permitted
pursuant to the preceding proviso such Loans shall be automatically continued as LIBOR Loans with an Interest Period of one month. Upon receipt of any such notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each relevant Lender thereof. 
SECTION 2.14 Limitations on LIBOR Tranches. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all borrowings,
conversions, continuations and optional prepayments of LIBOR Loans hereunder and all selections of Interest Periods hereunder shall be in such amounts and be made pursuant to such elections so that, (a) after giving effect thereto, the
aggregate principal amount of the LIBOR Loans comprising each LIBOR Tranche shall be equal to $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and (b) no more than 10 LIBOR Tranches shall be outstanding at any one time. 
SECTION 2.15 Interest Rates and Payment Dates. (a) Each LIBOR Loan shall bear interest for each day during each Interest
Period with respect thereto at a rate per annum equal to the Adjusted LIBOR Rate determined applicable to such LIBOR Loan plus the Applicable Margin. 
(b)    Each ABR Loan shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin.
 (c)

acceleration or otherwise), such overdue amount shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to
the rate then applicable to ABR Loans under the relevant Facility plus 2% (in the case of overdue amounts in Dollars), in each case, with respect to clauses (i) and (ii) above, from the date of such nonpayment until such amount is paid
in full (as well after as before judgment).  (d)    Interest shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date;
provided that interest accruing pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section 2.15 shall be payable from time to time on demand. 
SECTION 2.16 Computation of Interest and Fees. (a) Interest, fees and commissions payable pursuant hereto shall be calculated on
the basis of a 360-day year for the actual days elapsed, except that, with respect to ABR Loans for which the rate of interest is calculated on the basis of the

  47 





Prime Rate, interest shall be calculated on the basis of a 365/366-day year for the actual number of days elapsed. The Administrative Agent shall as soon
as practicable notify the Borrower and the relevant Lenders of each determination of a Adjusted LIBOR Rate. The Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the Borrower and the relevant Lenders of the effective date and the amount of
each such change in interest rate.  (b)    Each determination of an interest rate by the Administrative Agent pursuant
to any provision of this Agreement shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower and the Lenders in the absence of manifest error. The Administrative Agent shall, at the request of the Borrower, deliver to the Borrower a statement showing the
quotations used by the Administrative Agent in determining any interest rate pursuant to Section 2.15(a) and the calculation of any Statutory Reserves. 
SECTION 2.17 Inability to Determine Interest Rate. If prior to the first day of any Interest Period for any LIBOR Loan in Dollars:
 (a)    the Administrative Agent shall have reasonably determined that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for
ascertaining the LIBOR Rate or the Adjusted LIBOR Rate, as applicable, for such LIBOR Loan in such currency for such Interest Period, or 
(b)    the Administrative Agent shall have received written notice from the Majority Facility Lenders in respect of a
Facility that the LIBOR Rate or the Adjusted LIBOR Rate, as applicable, determined or to be determined with respect to such LIBOR Loan under such Facility in such currency for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to
such Lenders of making or maintaining their respective Loans during such Interest Period;  then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof (which
may be by telephone confirmed in writing) to the Borrower and the relevant Lenders as soon as practicable thereafter. If such notice is given (w) any LIBOR Loans in Dollars under such Facility requested to be made on the first day of such
Interest Period shall be made as ABR Loans, after consultation with the Borrower and the applicable Lenders, to compensate the applicable Lenders for such Loan in such currency for the applicable period plus the Applicable Margin, (x) any Loans
in Dollars under such Facility that were to have been converted on the first day of such Interest Period to LIBOR Loans shall be continued as ABR Loans and (y) any outstanding LIBOR Loans in Dollars under such Facility shall be converted, on
the last day of the then-current Interest Period, to ABR Loans, after consultation with the Borrower and the applicable Lenders, to compensate the applicable Lenders for such Loan in such currency for the applicable period plus the Applicable
Margin. The Administrative Agent shall withdraw such notice as soon as adequate and reasonable means exist for ascertaining the LIBOR Rate or the Adjusted LIBOR Rate, as applicable. Until such notice has been withdrawn by the Administrative Agent,
no further LIBOR Loans under such Facility shall be made or continued as such, nor shall the Borrower have the right to convert Loans to LIBOR Loans under such Facility. 
SECTION 2.18 Pro Rata Treatment and Payments. (a) Each borrowing by the Borrower from the Lenders hereunder, each payment by the
Borrower on account of any commitment fee and any reduction of the Commitments of the Lenders shall be made pro rata according to the respective Tranche A Term Loan Percentages, Incremental Term Loan Percentages or Revolving Credit Percentages, as
the case may be, of the relevant Lenders.  (b)    Each payment (including each prepayment) by the Borrower on account
of principal of and interest on the Term Loans shall be made pro rata according to the respective outstanding principal amounts of the Term Loans then held by the Term Loan Lenders. The amount of each principal prepayment of the Term Loans shall be
applied to reduce the then remaining installments of the Tranche A Term Loans and Incremental Term Loans, as the case may be, pro rata based upon the respective then remaining principal amounts thereof. Amounts prepaid on account of the Term Loans
may not be reborrowed. 
  48 




(c)    Each payment (including each prepayment) by the Borrower on
account of principal of and interest on any Revolving Credit Loans shall be made pro rata according to the respective outstanding principal amounts of such Revolving Credit Loans then held by the Revolving Credit Lenders. 
(d)    All payments (including prepayments) to be made by the Borrower hereunder, whether on account of principal,
interest, fees or otherwise, shall be made without setoff or counterclaim and shall be made prior to 12:00 Noon, Local Time, on the due date thereof to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Lenders, at the applicable Funding Office, in
Dollars and in immediately available funds. The Administrative Agent shall distribute such payments to the Lenders promptly upon receipt in like funds as received. If any payment hereunder (other than payments on the LIBOR Loans) becomes due and
payable on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day. If any payment on a LIBOR Loan becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, the maturity thereof shall be extended to the
next succeeding Business Day unless the result of such extension would be to extend such payment into another calendar month, in which event such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day. In the case of any extension of any
payment of principal pursuant to the preceding two sentences, interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such extension. 
(e)    Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by any Lender prior to a borrowing that such
Lender will not make the amount that would constitute its share of such borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender is making such amount available to the Administrative Agent, and the
Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. If such amount is not made available to the Administrative Agent by the required time on the Borrowing Date therefor, such Lender
shall pay to the Administrative Agent, on demand, such amount with interest thereon at a rate equal to the greater of (i) the Federal Funds Rate and (ii) a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry
rules on interbank compensation, for the period until such Lender makes such amount immediately available to the Administrative Agent. A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this
Section 2.18(e) shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. If such Lenders share of such borrowing is not made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender within three Business Days of such Borrowing Date, the
Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum applicable to ABR Loans under the relevant Facility, on demand, from the Borrower, and, if so recovered, such amount shall no longer be
deemed outstanding hereunder.  (f)    Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by the
Borrower prior to the date of any payment being made hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower is making such payment, and the Administrative Agent may,
but shall not be required to, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Lenders their respective pro rata shares of a corresponding amount. If such payment is not made to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower within three Business
Days of such required date, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover, on demand, from each Lender to which any amount which was made available pursuant to the preceding sentence, such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum
equal to the daily average Federal Funds Effective Rate. Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender against the Borrower. 
  49 




(g)    If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made
by it pursuant to Section 2.18(e), 2.18(f), 2.20(g), 2.20(h) 3.4(a) or 9.7, then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion and notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, (i) apply any amounts thereafter received by the
Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender for the benefit of the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Lender to satisfy such Lenders obligations to it under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid, and/or
(ii) hold any such amounts in a segregated account as Cash Collateral for, and application to, any future funding obligations of such Lender under any such Section, in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii) above, in any order as
determined by the Administrative Agent in its discretion.  SECTION 2.19 Requirements of Law. (a) If the adoption of or
any change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by any Lender with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any central bank or other Governmental Authority made
subsequent to the date hereof:  (i)    shall subject any Lender to any Taxes (other than (A) Non-Excluded Taxes in respect of payments under any Loan Document, (B) Other Taxes, (C) Connection Income Taxes and (D) Taxes in respect of payments under any Loan Document for which a Loan
Party is not responsible for the payment of additional amounts under Section 2.20(a)) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable
thereto;  (ii)    shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan
or similar requirement against assets held by, deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, advances, loans or other extensions of credit by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any office of such Lender which is not otherwise included
in the determination of the Adjusted LIBOR Rate hereunder; or  (iii)    shall impose on such Lender any
other condition;  and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender, by an amount which such Lender deems to be material, of
making, converting into, continuing or maintaining LIBOR Loans (or in the case of (i), any Loans) or issuing or participating in Letters of Credit, or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder in respect thereof, then, in any such case, the Borrower
shall promptly pay (or shall cause the Borrower to pay) such Lender, upon its demand, any additional amounts necessary to compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduced amount receivable; provided that in the event of the adoption
of or any change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by any Lender with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any central bank or other Governmental Authority
described in Section 2.19(a)(i), the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this paragraph for any amounts incurred more than six months prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of such Lenders
intention to claim compensation therefor, and provided further that, if the circumstances giving rise to such claim have a retroactive effect, then such six-month period shall be extended to
include the period of such retroactive effect. If any Lender becomes entitled to claim any additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.19, it shall promptly notify the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of the event by reason
of which it has become so entitled (and any related calculations).  (b)    If any Lender shall have determined that the
adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law regarding capital adequacy or liquidity or in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender with any request or directive

  50 





regarding capital adequacy or liquidity (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority made subsequent to the date hereof shall have the effect of reducing the rate of
return on such Lenders or such corporations capital as a consequence of its obligations to lend hereunder or under or in respect of any Letter of Credit to a level below that which such Lender or such corporation could have achieved but
for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration such Lenders or such corporations policies with respect to capital adequacy or liquidity) by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then from time to time, after
submission by such Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of a written request therefor, the Borrower shall pay (or shall cause the Borrower to pay) to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such
Lender or such corporation for such reduction provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this paragraph for any amounts incurred more than six months prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower
of such Lenders intention to claim compensation therefor; and provided further that, if the circumstances giving rise to such claim have a retroactive effect, then such six-month period
shall be extended to include the period of such retroactive effect.  (c)    Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, (i) all requests, rules, guidelines, requirements and directives promulgated by the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (or any successor or similar authority) or by United States or foreign
regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to Basel III, and (ii) the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and all requests, rules, guidelines, requirements and directives thereunder or issued in connection therewith or
in implementation thereof, shall in each case be deemed to be a change in Requirements of Law, regardless of the date enacted, adopted, issued or implemented. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Lender shall be entitled to seek compensation for costs
imposed pursuant to matters set forth in this clause (c) (x) unless it is generally seeking compensation for such costs from similarly situated borrowers under yield protection provisions in credit agreements with the Borrowers that provide for
such compensation and (y) in the case of a Change in Law, such Change in Law occurred after the date on which such Person became a Lender hereunder. 
(d)    If payment in respect of any Revolving Extension of Credit shall be due in a currency other than Dollars and/or at a
place of payment other than New York and if, by reason of any change in a Requirement of Law subsequent to the Closing Date, disruption of currency or foreign exchange markets, war or civil disturbance or similar event, payment of such Obligations
in such currency or such place of payment shall be impossible, then, at the election of any affected Lender, the Borrower shall make payment of such Revolving Extension of Credit in Dollars and/or in New York, and shall indemnify such Lender against
any currency exchange losses or reasonable out-of-pocket expenses that it shall sustain as a result of such alternative payment. 
(e)    A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.19 submitted by any Lender to the
Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) shall contain reasonable supporting calculations and an explanation in connection therewith and shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. The obligations of the Borrower pursuant to this
Section 2.19 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder, except to the extent provided for in Section 2.19(b). 
SECTION 2.20 Taxes. (a) All payments made by or on behalf of any Loan Party under this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall
be made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for or on account of, any Taxes, excluding (i) net income taxes, branch profits taxes and franchise taxes (imposed in lieu of net income taxes) imposed on a Recipient (x) as a
result of such Recipient being organized under the laws of, or having its principal office, or, in the case of any Lender, its applicable lending office located in the jurisdiction imposing such Tax (or any political subdivision thereof), or
(y) that are Other Connection Taxes, (ii) in the case of a Lender, U.S. federal withholding 
  51 





Taxes imposed on amounts payable to or for the account of such Lender with respect to an applicable interest in a Loan, Letter of Credit or Commitment pursuant to a law in effect on the date on
which (x) such Lender acquires such interest in the Loan, Letter of Credit or Commitment (other than pursuant to an assignment request by the Borrower under Section 2.24), or (y) such Lender changes its lending office, except in each
case to the extent that, pursuant to this Section 2.20, amounts with respect to such Taxes were payable either to such Lenders assignor immediately before such Lender acquired the applicable interest in a Loan, Letter of Credit or
Commitment or to such Lender immediately before it changed its lending office, (iii) Taxes attributable to such Administrative Agent or Lenders failure to comply with Section 2.20(d), and (iv) withholding Taxes imposed under
FATCA (all Taxes other than those described in preceding clauses (i) through (iv), collectively or individually, Non-Excluded Taxes); provided that, if any Taxes are required to
be deducted or withheld from any amounts payable to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, as determined in good faith by the applicable withholding agent, (x) such amounts shall be deducted or withheld and shall be paid to the relevant
Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law, and (y) if such Tax is a Non-Excluded Tax, the amounts so payable by the applicable Loan Party to the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall be
increased to the extent necessary so that, after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.20), the amounts received with respect to this
Agreement equal the sum which would have been received had no such deduction or withholding been made.  (b)    In
addition, and without duplication of other amounts payable by the Borrower under this Section 2.20, the Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law, or at the option of the
Administrative Agent, timely reimburse it for, Other Taxes.  (c)    Whenever any
Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes are payable by the Borrower, as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter, the Borrower shall send to the Administrative Agent, a certified copy of an original official
receipt received by the Borrower showing payment thereof or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. If any Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes are imposed directly
upon the Administrative Agent or any Lender (including Non-Excluded Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section), the Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent
and the Lenders for such amounts and any incremental Taxes that may become payable by the Administrative Agent or any Lender as a result of any such direct imposition within 10 days of written demand therefor specifying in reasonable detail the
nature and amount of such amounts.  (d)    Each Lender that is a United States person as defined in
Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or before the date on which it becomes a party to this Agreement two properly completed and duly signed copies of U.S. Internal Revenue Service
(IRS) Form W-9 (or any successor form) certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal withholding tax. Each Lender (or Transferee) that is not a United States person as
defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code (a Non-U.S. Lender) shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (or, in the case of a Participant, to the Lender from
which the related participation shall have been purchased) (i) two copies of properly completed and duly executed IRS Form W-8BEN, Form
W-8BEN-E, Form W-8ECI or Form W-8IMY, as applicable, (together with any applicable
underlying IRS forms and appropriate attachments), on which such Non-U.S. Lender shall claim any exemption from or reduction of U.S. federal withholding tax for which such
Non-U.S. Lender is eligible, (ii) in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender claiming exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the
Code with respect to payments of portfolio interest, a statement substantially in the form of Exhibit F and the applicable IRS Form W-8, or any subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto,
properly completed and duly executed by such Non-U.S. Lender, or (iii) any other form 
  52 





prescribed by the applicable requirements of U.S. federal income tax law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding tax duly completed together with such
supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable requirements of law to permit the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made or to satisfy any information reporting
requirements. Such forms shall be delivered by each Non-U.S. Lender on or before the date it becomes a party to this Agreement (or, in the case of any Participant, on or before the date such Participant
purchases the related participation) and from time to time thereafter upon the request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent. In addition, each Non-U.S. Lender shall deliver such forms promptly on or
before the inaccuracy, obsolescence or invalidity of any form previously delivered by such Non-U.S. Lender. Each Non-U.S. Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower and
the Administrative Agent at any time it determines that it is no longer in a position to provide any previously delivered certificate to the Borrower (or any other form of certification adopted by the U.S. taxing authorities for such purpose).
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.20, a Non-U.S. Lender, upon prompt written notice to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, shall not be required to deliver any form pursuant to
this Section 2.20 that such Non-U.S. Lender is not legally able to deliver. Each Lender authorizes the Administrative Agent to deliver to the Loan Parties and to any successor Administrative Agent any
documentation provided by such Lender to the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 2.20(d).  (e)    A
Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of non-U.S. withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party,
with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such
properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate; provided that such Lender is legally entitled to complete, execute and deliver such
documentation and in such Lenders reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would not materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. 
(f)    If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax imposed by
FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by
Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under
FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lenders obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (f), FATCA shall include any
amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.  (g)    Each Lender shall indemnify the Administrative Agent
for the full amount of any Taxes imposed by any Governmental Authority that are attributable to such Lender (but, in the case of Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes for which the Borrower is responsible pursuant
to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 2.20, only to the extent that the Borrower has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes and without
limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so) and that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent, together with all interest, penalties, reasonable costs and expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, as determined by the
Administrative Agent in good faith. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
  53 




(h)    If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good
faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 2.20 (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.20), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an
amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section 2.20 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all
out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect
to such refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this Section 2.20(h) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the
relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.20(h), in no event will the indemnified party
be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this Section 2.20(h) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the
indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never
been paid. This Section 2.20(h) shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.
 (i)    Each partys obligations under this Section 2.20 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the
Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document. 
SECTION 2.21 Indemnity. The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender for, and to hold each Lender harmless from, any loss or
expense (in each case as reasonably determined by such Lender) that such Lender may sustain or incur as a consequence of (a) default by the Borrower in making a borrowing of, conversion into or continuation of LIBOR Loans after the Borrower has
given a notice requesting the same in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement (except as a result of a notice by the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 2.17), (b) default by the Borrower in making any prepayment of or conversion
from LIBOR Loans after the Borrower has given a notice thereof in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, (c) the making of a prepayment of LIBOR Loans on a day that is not the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto
(including as a result of an Event of Default) or (d) the assignment of a LIBOR Loan on a day that is not the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.24. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, such indemnification shall include the costs and expenses of each Lender that are attributable to the premature unwinding of any Hedging Agreement entered into by such Lender in respect of the foreign
currency exposure attributable to such actual or proposed LIBOR Loan. Such indemnification may include an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest that would have accrued on the amount so prepaid, or not so borrowed,
converted or continued, for the period from the date of such prepayment or of such failure to borrow, convert or continue to the last day of such Interest Period (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, the Interest Period that
would have commenced on the date of such failure) in each case at the applicable rate of interest for such Loans provided for herein (excluding, however, the Applicable Margin included therein, if any) over (ii) the amount of interest (as
reasonably determined by such Lender) that would have accrued to such Lender on such amount by placing such amount on deposit for a comparable period with leading banks in the interbank eurocurrency market. A certificate as to any amounts payable
pursuant to this Section 2.21 submitted to the Borrower by any Lender shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. This covenant shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable
hereunder. 
  54 




SECTION 2.22 Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if the
adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or application thereof shall make it unlawful for any Lender to make or maintain LIBOR Loans as contemplated by this Agreement, (a) the commitment of such Lender
hereunder to make LIBOR Loans, continue LIBOR Loans as such and convert ABR Loans to LIBOR Loans shall forthwith be cancelled and (b) each of such Lenders Loans then outstanding as a LIBOR Loan, if any, shall if denominated in Dollars, be
converted automatically to an ABR Loan on the last day of the then current Interest Period with respect to such Loan or within such earlier period as required by law. If any such conversion or repayment of a LIBOR Loan occurs on a day which is not
the last day of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such amounts, if any, as may be required pursuant to Section 2.21. 
SECTION 2.23 Mitigation. Each Lender agrees that, upon the occurrence of any event giving rise to the operation of
Section 2.19 or 2.20 with respect to such Lender, it will, if requested by the Borrower, use reasonable efforts (subject to overall policy considerations of such Lender) to mitigate or reduce the additional amounts payable (or any similar
amount that may thereafter accrue), which reasonable efforts may include designating another lending office for any Loans affected by such event with the object of avoiding the consequences of such event, assigning such Lenders rights and
obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, or any other measures reasonably requested by the Borrower; provided that such designation is, assignment or other measures are; provided that such designation is
made on terms that, in the sole judgment of such Lender, cause such Lender and its lending office(s) to suffer no economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage, and provided, further, that nothing in this Section 2.23 shall affect or
postpone any of the obligations of the Borrower or the rights of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.19 or 2.20.  SECTION
2.24 Replacement of Lenders under Certain Circumstances. The Borrower shall be permitted to replace any Lender which (a) requests payment of or reimbursement for amounts owing pursuant to Section 2.19 or 2.20, (b) becomes a
Defaulting Lender or (c) does not consent to any proposed amendment, supplement, modification, consent or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document that requires the consent of each of the Lenders or each of the
Lenders affected thereby (so long as the consent of the Required Lenders has been obtained), with a replacement financial institution; provided that (i) such replacement does not conflict with any Requirement of Law, (ii) no Event
of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such replacement, (iii) prior to any such replacement, such Lender shall have taken no action under Section 2.23 so as to eliminate the continued need for payment of amounts
owing pursuant to Section 2.19 or 2.20, (iv) the replacement financial institution shall purchase, at par, all Loans and pay all other amounts owing to such replaced Lender on or prior to the date of replacement, (v) the Borrower shall be
liable to such replaced Lender under Section 2.21 if any LIBOR Loan owing to such replaced Lender shall be purchased other than on the last day of the Interest Period relating thereto, (vi) the replacement financial institution, if not
already a Lender, shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, (vii) the replaced Lender shall be obligated to make such replacement in accordance with the provisions of Section 10.6 (provided that the Borrower shall be
obligated to pay the registration and processing fee referred to therein), (viii) the Borrower or the replacement financial institution shall pay all amounts (if any) due pursuant to Section 2.19 or 2.20, as the case may be, incurred prior to
the date Borrower exercises its rights under this Section 2.24, and (ix) any such replacement shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any rights which the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any other Lender shall have against the replaced
Lender. Each party hereto agrees that an assignment required pursuant to this paragraph may be effected pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption executed by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the assignee, and that the Lender required to
make such assignment need not be a party thereto in order for such assignment to be effective.  SECTION 2.25 [Reserved].

Section 2.26(a) shall be in an aggregate principal amount that is not less than $30,000,000 (or such lesser amount as may be approved by the Administrative Agent).

(e)    This Section 2.26 shall supersede any provisions in Section 10.1 to the contrary. 
SECTION 2.27 Defaulting Lenders. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a
Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender: 
(a)    fees shall cease to accrue on the unfunded portion of the Revolving Credit Commitment of such Defaulting Lender
pursuant to Section 2.9(a);  (b)    the Revolving Credit Commitment and Revolving Extensions of Credit of such
Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether the Required Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment, waiver or other modification pursuant to Section 10.1); provided,
that this clause (b) shall not apply to the vote of a Defaulting Lender in the case of an amendment, waiver or other modification requiring the consent of such Lender or each Lender affected thereby; 
(c)    if any L/C Obligations exist at the time such Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender then: 
(i)    all or any part L/C Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall be reallocated among the non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Revolving Credit Percentages but only to the extent the sum of all non-Defaulting Lenders Revolving Extensions
of Credit plus such Defaulting Lenders L/C Exposure does not exceed the total of all non-Defaulting Lenders Revolving Credit Commitments; 
(ii)    if the reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected,
the Borrower shall within one Business Day following notice by the Administrative Agent Cash Collateralize for the benefit of the Issuing Lender only the Borrowers obligations corresponding to such Defaulting Lenders L/C Exposure (after
giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (i) above) in accordance with the procedures set forth in Article VIII for so long as such L/C Exposure is outstanding; 
(iii)    if the Borrower Cash Collateralizes any portion of such Defaulting Lenders L/C Exposure
pursuant to clause (ii) above, the Borrower shall not be required to pay any fees to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 3.3(a) with respect to such Defaulting Lenders L/C Exposure during the period such Defaulting
Lenders L/C Exposure is Cash Collateralized; 
  57 




(iv)    if the L/C Exposure of the non-Defaulting Lenders is reallocated pursuant to clause (i) above, then the fees payable to the Lenders pursuant to Section 3.3(a) shall be adjusted in accordance with such
non-Defaulting Lenders Revolving Credit Percentages; and 
(v)    if all or any portion of such Defaulting Lenders L/C Exposure is neither reallocated nor Cash
Collateralized pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) above, then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of the Issuing Lender or any other Lender hereunder, all fees payable under Section 3.3(a) with respect to such Defaulting Lenders
L/C Exposure shall be payable to the Issuing Lender until and to the extent that such L/C Exposure is reallocated and/or Cash Collateralized; and 
(d)    so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender, the Issuing Lender shall not be required to issue, amend or increase
any Letter of Credit, unless it is satisfied that the related exposure and the Defaulting Lenders then outstanding L/C Exposure will be 100% covered by the Revolving Credit Commitments of the
non-Defaulting Lenders, and participating interests in any newly issued or increased Letter of Credit shall be allocated among non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner
consistent with Section 2.27(c)(i) (and such Defaulting Lender shall not participate therein).  In the event that the Administrative
Agent, the Borrower and the Issuing Lender each agrees that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then L/C Exposure of the Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of
such Lenders Revolving Credit Commitment and on such date such Lender shall purchase at par such of the Loans of the other Lenders as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Loans in
accordance with its Revolving Credit Percentage.  SECTION 2.28 Incremental Facilities. (a) The Borrower and any one or
more Lenders (including New Lenders) may from time to time agree that such Lenders shall make, obtain or increase the amount of their Incremental Term Loans (an Incremental Term Loan Facility) or Revolving Credit Commitments
(Increased Revolving Credit Commitments; together with any Incremental Term Loan Facility, the Incremental Facilities), as applicable, by executing and delivering to the Administrative Agent an Increased
Facility Activation Notice specifying (i) the amount of such increase, (ii) the applicable Increased Facility Closing Date, (iii) in the case of Incremental Term Loans, (x) the applicable Incremental Term Maturity Date,
(y) the amortization schedule for such Incremental Term Loans, and (z) the Applicable Margin for such Incremental Term Loans; provided that (i) subject to the Borrowers right to make an LCA Election with respect to any
Limited Condition Acquisition, in which case, Section 1.3(b) shall apply, no Default or Event of Default exists or would exist after giving effect to such Incremental Facility and the incurrence of any Loans thereunder on the applicable
Increased Facility Closing Date, (ii) the maturity date and Weighted Average Life to Maturity of any such Incremental Term Loan Facility shall be no earlier than (or the same as) the maturity date and Weighted Average Life to Maturity,
respectively, of the Tranche A Term Loans, (iii) the interest rates and amortization schedule applicable to any Incremental Term Loan Facility shall be determined by the Borrower and the lenders thereunder, (iv) subject to the
Borrowers right to make an LCA Election with respect to any Limited Condition Acquisition, in which case, Section 1.3(b) shall apply, the Borrower shall be in Pro Forma Compliance with the Financial Covenants (such calculation to be made
(I) assuming in the case of any Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments, that the full amount thereof is to be drawn and (II) any proceeds of any Incremental Facility shall be disregarded in any netting calculations in determination of
such Financial Covenants) and (v) any Increased Revolving Credit Commitments shall be on terms and pursuant to documentation applicable to the Revolving Credit Facility (including the maturity date in respect thereof) and any Incremental Term
Loan Facility shall be on terms and pursuant to documentation agreed to between the Borrower and the Person providing such Incremental Term Loan Facility; provided 
  58 





that, (1) to the extent such terms are not consistent with, in the case of an Incremental Term Loan Facility, the Tranche A Term Loan Facility (except to the extent permitted by clause
(ii) and (iii) above), shall not be materially more restrictive to Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries, when taken as a whole, than those under the Tranche A Term Loan Facility (except if (x) such covenants or other provisions are
applicable only to periods after the latest final maturity date of the Tranche A Term Loan Facility, (y) the existing Lenders under the Tranche A Term Loan Facility receive the benefit of such terms or (z) such terms are reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent or are, in the reasonable judgment of the Borrower, generally customary for similarly situated borrowers in the current market conditions) and (2) to the extent such documentation is not consistent with
the documentation in respect of the Tranche A Term Loan Facility, it shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) without the consent of the Required Lenders, the aggregate amount of
Incremental Term Loans and Increased Revolving Credit Commitments obtained after the Closing Date pursuant to this paragraph shall not exceed the Incremental Facilities Amount and (ii) without the consent of the Administrative Agent, each
increase effected pursuant to this paragraph shall be in a minimum amount of at least $15,000,000 (or such lesser amount of the Incremental Facilities Amount then unused). No Lender shall have any obligation to participate in any increase described
in this paragraph unless it agrees to do so in its sole discretion.  (b)    Any Lender and any additional bank,
financial institution or other entity that, with the consent of the Borrower and, to the extent such consent would be required for an assignment to such Person pursuant to Section 10.6, the Administrative Agent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), elects to become a Lender under this Agreement in connection with any transaction described in Section 2.28(a) shall execute an Incremental Lender Supplement (each, an
Incremental Lender Supplement), substantially in the form of Exhibit H, whereupon such bank, financial institution or other entity (a New Lender) shall become a Lender for all purposes and to the same extent as
if originally a party hereto and shall be bound by and entitled to the benefits of this Agreement.  (c)    Unless
otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent, on each Increased Facility Closing Date with respect to the Revolving Credit Facility, the Borrower shall borrow Revolving Credit Loans under the relevant increased Revolving Credit Commitments from each
Lender participating in the relevant increase in an amount determined by reference to the amount of each Type of Revolving Credit Loan (and, in the case of LIBOR Loans, of each LIBOR Tranche) which would then have been outstanding from such Lender
if (i) each such Type or LIBOR Tranche had been borrowed or effected on such Increased Facility Closing Date and (ii) the aggregate amount of each such Type or LIBOR Tranche requested to be so borrowed or effected had been proportionately
increased; provided that (i) in lieu of borrowings and repayments of Revolving Credit Loans, the Administrative Agent shall make sure notations on the Register as it reasonably determines are necessary to ensure that the Revolving Credit
Loans are held on a pro rata basis after giving effect to such Increased Facility, and (ii) each Lender (including any New Lender) hereby agrees to waive any amount that would otherwise be payable in connection therewith pursuant to
Section 2.21. The LIBOR Rate applicable to any LIBOR Loan borrowed pursuant to the preceding sentence shall equal the LIBOR Rate then applicable to the LIBOR Loans of the other Revolving Credit Lenders in the same LIBOR Tranche (or, until the
expiration of the then-current Interest Period, such other rate as shall be agreed upon between the Borrower and the relevant Revolving Credit Lender). 
(d)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that, on each
Increased Facility Closing Date, this Agreement shall be amended to the extent (but only to the extent) necessary to reflect the existence and terms of the Incremental Term Loans evidenced thereby. Any such deemed amendment may be effected in
writing by the Administrative Agent with the Borrowers consent (not to be unreasonably withheld) and furnished to the other parties hereto. 
  59 




ARTICLE III. LETTERS OF CREDIT 
SECTION 3.1 L/C Commitment. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Issuing Lender, in reliance on the agreements of
the other Revolving Credit Lenders set forth in Section 3.4(a), agrees to issue letters of credit (Letters of Credit) for the account of the Borrower on any Business Day during the Revolving Credit Commitment Period in such
form as may be approved from time to time by the Issuing Lender; provided that the Issuing Lender shall have no obligation to issue any Letter of Credit if, after giving effect to such issuance, (i) the L/C Obligations would exceed the
L/C Commitment or (ii) the aggregate amount of the Available Revolving Credit Commitments would be less than zero. Each Letter of Credit shall (i) be denominated in Dollars, AUD, Euro, Sterling or any other currency agreed to by the
Administrative Agent and the applicable Issuing Lender and (ii) expire no later than the earlier of (x) the first anniversary of its date of issuance unless consented to by the Issuing Lender and (y) the Letter of Credit Expiration
Date; provided that any Letter of Credit with a one-year term may provide for the renewal thereof for additional one-year periods (which shall in no event extend
beyond the date referred to in clause (y) above unless the Borrower agree to Cash Collateralize or backstop or provide other credit support for such Letter of Credit prior to the Letter of Credit Expiration Date in a manner reasonably
acceptable to the applicable Issuing Lender).  (b)    Unless otherwise expressly agreed by the Issuing Lender and the
Borrower when a Letter of Credit is issued, (i) the rules of the ISP shall apply to each standby Letter of Credit, and (ii) the rules of the UCP shall apply to each commercial Letter of Credit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuing
Lender shall not be responsible to the Borrower for, and the Issuing Lenders rights and remedies against the Borrower shall not be impaired by, any action or inaction of the Issuing Lender required or permitted under any law, order, or
practice that is required or permitted to be applied to any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, including the applicable law or any order of a jurisdiction where the Issuing Lender or the beneficiary is located, the practice stated in the ISP or
UCP, as applicable, or in the decisions, opinions, practice statements, or official commentary of the International Chamber of Commerce Banking Commission, the Bankers Association for Finance and TradeInternational Financial Services
Association (BAFT-IFSA), or the Institute of International Banking Law & Practice, whether or not any Letter of Credit chooses such law or practice. 
(c)    The Issuing Lender shall not at any time be obligated to issue any Letter of Credit hereunder if such issuance would
conflict with, or cause the Issuing Lender or any L/C Participant to exceed any limits imposed by, any applicable Requirement of Law. 
SECTION 3.2 Procedure for Issuance of Letters of Credit. The Borrower (on its own behalf) may from time to time request that the
Issuing Lender issue a Letter of Credit by delivering to the Issuing Lender at its address for notices specified herein an Application therefor, completed to the satisfaction of the Issuing Lender, and such other certificates, documents and other
papers and information as the Issuing Lender may reasonably request. Upon receipt of any Application, the Issuing Lender will process such Application and the certificates, documents and other papers and information delivered to it in connection
therewith in accordance with its customary procedures and shall promptly issue the Letter of Credit requested thereby (but in no event shall the Issuing Lender be required to issue any Letter of Credit earlier than three Business Days after its
receipt of the Application therefor and all such other certificates, documents and other papers and information relating thereto) by issuing the original of such Letter of Credit to the beneficiary thereof or as otherwise may be agreed to by the
Issuing Lender and the Borrower. The Issuing Lender shall furnish a copy of such Letter of Credit to the Borrower promptly following the issuance thereof. The Issuing Lender shall promptly furnish to the Administrative Agent, which shall in turn
promptly furnish to the Lenders, notice of the issuance of each Letter of Credit (including the amount thereof). 
  60 




SECTION 3.3 Commissions, Fees and Other Charges. (a) The Borrower will pay
a commission on all undrawn and unpaid Letters of Credit at a per annum rate equal to the Applicable Margin then in effect with respect to LIBOR Loans under the Revolving Credit Facility, shared ratably among the Revolving Credit Lenders and payable
quarterly in arrears on each L/C Fee Payment Date after the issuance date. In addition, the Borrower shall pay to the Issuing Lender for its own account a fronting fee of 0.125% per annum on the undrawn and unexpired amount of each Letter of Credit,
payable quarterly in arrears on each L/C Fee Payment Date after the issuance date.  (b)    In addition to the foregoing
fees and commissions, the Borrower shall pay or reimburse the Issuing Lender for such normal and customary costs and expenses as are incurred or charged by the Issuing Lender in issuing, negotiating, effecting payment under, amending or otherwise
administering any Letter of Credit.  SECTION 3.4 L/C Participations. (a) The Issuing Lender irrevocably agrees to grant
and hereby grants to each L/C Participant, and, to induce the Issuing Lender to issue Letters of Credit hereunder, each L/C Participant irrevocably agrees to accept and purchase and hereby accepts and purchases from the Issuing Lender, on the terms
and conditions hereinafter stated, for such L/C Participants own account and risk an undivided interest equal to such L/C Participants Revolving Credit Percentage in the Issuing Lenders obligations and rights under each Letter of
Credit issued hereunder and the amount of each draft paid by the Issuing Lender thereunder. Each L/C Participant unconditionally and irrevocably agrees with the Issuing Lender that, if a draft is paid under any Letter of Credit for which the Issuing
Lender is not reimbursed in full by the Borrower in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, such L/C Participant shall pay to the Issuing Lender upon demand at the Issuing Lenders address for notices specified herein an amount equal to
such L/C Participants Revolving Credit Percentage of the amount of such draft, or any part thereof, which is not so reimbursed. 
(b)    If any amount required to be paid by any L/C Participant to the Issuing Lender pursuant to Section 3.4(a) in
respect of any unreimbursed portion of any payment made by the Issuing Lender under any Letter of Credit is paid to the Issuing Lender within three Business Days after the date such payment is due, such L/C Participant shall pay to the Issuing
Lender on demand an amount equal to the product of (i) such amount, times (ii) the daily average Federal Funds Rate during the period from and including the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately
available to the Issuing Lender, times (iii) a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days that elapse during such period and the denominator of which is 360. If any such amount required to be paid by any L/C Participant pursuant to
Section 3.4(a) is not made available to the Issuing Lender by such L/C Participant within three Business Days after the date such payment is due, the Issuing Lender shall be entitled to recover from such L/C Participant, on demand, such amount
with interest thereon calculated from such due date at the rate per annum applicable to ABR Loans under the Revolving Credit Facility. A certificate of the Issuing Lender submitted to any L/C Participant with respect to any amounts owing under this
Section 3.4 shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.  (c)    Whenever, at any time after the Issuing
Lender has made payment under any Letter of Credit and has received from any L/C Participant its pro rata share of such payment in accordance with Section 3.4(a), the Issuing Lender receives any payment related to such Letter of Credit (whether
directly from the Borrower or otherwise, including proceeds of collateral applied thereto by the Issuing Lender), or any payment of interest on account thereof, the Issuing Lender will distribute to such L/C Participant its pro rata share thereof;
provided that in the event that any such payment received by the Issuing Lender shall be required to be returned by the Issuing Lender, such L/C Participant shall return to the Issuing Lender the portion thereof previously distributed by the
Issuing Lender to it. 
  61 




SECTION 3.5 Reimbursement Obligation of the Borrower. The Borrower agrees
to reimburse the Issuing Lender on each date on which the Issuing Lender provides written notice to the Borrower of the date and amount of a draft presented under any Letter of Credit and paid by the Issuing Lender for the amount of (a) such
draft so paid and (b) any taxes, fees, charges or other costs or expenses incurred by the Issuing Lender in connection with such payment; provided that if the Issuing Lender does not so notify the Borrower as provided for above earlier
than 9:30 a.m., Local Time on the date such draft is paid (or on any subsequent date on which notice is provided) then such reimbursement payment may be made two Business Days immediately subsequent to the date such notice is given. Each such
payment shall be made to the Issuing Lender at its address for notices specified herein or as it may otherwise direct in lawful money of the United States, as the case maybe, and in immediately available funds.    Each drawing
under any Letter of Credit shall constitute a request by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent for a borrowing pursuant to Section 2.5 of ABR Loans in the amount of such drawing, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth in
Section 5.2. The Borrowing Date with respect to such borrowing shall be the date of such drawing. If any amounts under this Article III remain unpaid because the conditions set forth in Section 5.2 cannot be satisfied or for any other
reason, such amounts shall bear interest from the date such amounts become payable (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) until payment in full at the rate set forth in Section 2.15(c). 
SECTION 3.6 Obligations Absolute. The Borrowers obligations under this Article III shall be absolute and unconditional under
any and all circumstances and irrespective of any setoff, counterclaim or defense to payment which the Borrower may have or have had against the Issuing Lender, any beneficiary of a Letter of Credit or any other Person. The Borrower also agrees with
the Issuing Lender that the Issuing Lender shall not be responsible for, and the Borrowers Reimbursement Obligations under Section 3.5 shall not be affected by, among other things, the validity or genuineness of documents or of any
endorsements thereon, even though such documents shall in fact prove to be invalid, fraudulent or forged, or any dispute between or among the Borrower and any beneficiary of any Letter of Credit or any other party to which such Letter of Credit may
be transferred or any claims whatsoever of the Borrower against any beneficiary of such Letter of Credit or any such transferee. The Issuing Lender shall not be liable for any error, omission, interruption or delay in transmission, dispatch or
delivery of any message or advice, however transmitted, in connection with any Letter of Credit, except for errors or omissions found by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
Issuing Lender. The Borrower agrees that any action taken or omitted by the Issuing Lender under or in connection with any Letter of Credit or the related drafts or documents, if done in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct and in
accordance with the standards of care specified in the Uniform Commercial Code of the State of New York, shall be binding on the Borrower and shall not result in any liability of the Issuing Lender to the Borrower. 
SECTION 3.7 Letter of Credit Payments. If any draft shall be presented for payment under any Letter of Credit, the Issuing Lender
shall promptly notify the Borrower of the date and amount thereof. The responsibility of the Issuing Lender to the Borrower in connection with any draft presented for payment under any Letter of Credit shall, in addition to any payment obligation
expressly provided for in such Letter of Credit, be limited to determining that the documents (including each draft) delivered under such Letter of Credit in connection with such presentment are in conformity with such Letter of Credit. 
SECTION 3.8 Applications. To the extent that any provision of any Application related to any Letter of Credit is inconsistent with
the provisions of this Article III, the provisions of this Article III shall apply. 
  62 




SECTION 3.9 Cash Collateralization. If on any date the L/C Obligations shall
exceed the L/C Commitment, then the Borrower shall within three Business Days after notice thereof from the Administrative Agent deposit in a cash collateral account opened by the Administrative Agent an amount equal to such excess plus accrued and
unpaid interest thereon.  SECTION 3.10 Provisions Related to Refinancing Revolving Credit Commitments. If the Letter of Credit
Expiration Date in respect of any tranche of Revolving Credit Commitments occurs prior to the expiry date of any Letter of Credit, then (i) if consented to by the Issuing Lender which issued such Letter of Credit, if one or more other tranches
of Revolving Credit Commitments in respect of which the Letter of Credit Expiration Date shall not have so occurred are then in effect, such Letters of Credit for which consent has been obtained shall automatically be deemed to have been issued
(including for purposes of the obligations of the Revolving Credit Lenders to purchase participations therein and to make Revolving Credit Loans and payments in respect thereof pursuant to Sections 3.4 and 3.5) under (and ratably participated
in by Lenders pursuant to) the Revolving Credit Commitments in respect of such non-terminating tranches up to an aggregate amount not to exceed the aggregate amount of the unutilized Revolving Credit
Commitments thereunder at such time (it being understood that no partial face amount of any Letter of Credit may be so reallocated) and (ii) to the extent not reallocated pursuant to immediately preceding clause (i), the Borrower (x) shall
Cash Collateralize all such Letters of Credit in an amount not less than the Minimum Collateral Amount with respect to such Letters of Credit (it being understood that such Cash Collateral shall be released to the extent that the aggregate stated
amount of such Letters of Credit is reduced upon the expiration or termination of such Letters of Credit, so that the Cash Collateral shall not exceed the Minimum Collateral Amount with respect to such Letters of Credit outstanding at any particular
time) or (y) deliver to the Issuing Lender a standby letter of credit (other than a Letter of Credit) in favor of such Issuing Lender in a stated amount not less than the Minimum Collateral Amount with respect to such Letters of Credit, which
standby letter of credit shall be in form and substance, and issued by a financially sound financial institution, reasonably acceptable to such Issuing Lender and the Administrative Agent. Upon the maturity date of any tranche of Revolving Credit
Commitments, the L/C Commitment may be reduced as agreed between the Issuing Lender and the Borrower, without the consent of any other Person.

sentence in an amount equal to the fair market value at the date of such designation of the Borrowers or its Subsidiarys (as applicable) Investment in such Subsidiary; provided that upon a designation of any Unrestricted
Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary, the Borrower or its Restricted Subsidiary shall be deemed to continue to have an Investment in the resulting Restricted Subsidiary in an amount (if positive) equal to (a) the amount of the Borrowers
or its Restricted Subsidiarys Investment in such Restricted Subsidiary at the time of such designation, less (b) the portion of the fair market value (as reasonably determined by the Borrower) of the assets of such Restricted Subsidiary
attributable to the Borrowers or its Restricted Subsidiarys equity therein at the time of such designation.

and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, or any fiduciary relationship with any Lender, and no implied
covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise exist against any Administrative Agent. 
SECTION 9.2 Delegation of Duties. The Administrative Agent may execute any of its duties under this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents by or through agents or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. The Administrative Agent
shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agents or attorneys in-fact selected by it with reasonable care. 
SECTION 9.3 Exculpatory Provisions. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates shall be (i) liable for any action lawfully taken or omitted to be taken by it or such Person under or in connection with this Agreement
or any other Loan Document (except to the extent that any of the foregoing are found by a final and nonappealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from its or such Persons own gross negligence or willful
misconduct) or (ii) responsible in any manner to any of the Lenders for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by any Loan Party or any officer thereof contained in this Agreement or any other Loan Document or in any
certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by the Administrative Agent under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other Loan Document or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness,
enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or for any failure of any Loan Party a party thereto to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder. The Administrative Agent shall not be under any obligation to any
Lender to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or to inspect the properties, books or records of any Loan Party. 
SECTION 9.4 Reliance by Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in
relying, upon any instrument, writing, resolution, notice, 
  91 





consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, facsimile, telex or teletype message, statement, order or other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed,
sent or made by the proper Person or Persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to the Loan Parties), independent accountants and other experts selected by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may deem
and treat the payee of any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes unless a written notice of assignment, negotiation or transfer thereof shall have been filed with the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in
failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement or any other Loan Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all Lenders) as it deems appropriate or
it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully
protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents in accordance with a request of the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all Lenders), and such request and any action taken or
failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Lenders and all future holders of the Loans.  SECTION 9.5 Notice of

Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a notice of default. In the event that the Administrative Agent receives such a notice, the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the
Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be reasonably directed by the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all Lenders); provided that unless and
until the Administrative Agent shall have received such directions, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem
advisable in the best interests of the Lenders.  SECTION 9.6 Non-Reliance on
Administrative Agent and Other Lenders. Each Lender expressly acknowledges that neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its officers, directors, employees, agents,
attorneys-in-fact or affiliates have made any representations or warranties to it and that no act by the Administrative Agent hereinafter taken, including any review of
the affairs of a Loan Party or any affiliate of a Loan Party, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by the Administrative Agent to any Lender. Each Lender represents to the Administrative Agent that it has, independently and
without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of, and investigation into, the business, operations, property, financial and other
condition and creditworthiness of the Loan Parties and their affiliates and made its own decision to make its Loans hereunder and enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents, and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Loan Parties and their affiliates. Except for
notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other
information concerning the business, operations, property, condition (financial or otherwise), prospects or creditworthiness of any Loan Party or any affiliate of a Loan Party which may come into the possession of the Administrative Agent or any of
its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates. 
  92 




SECTION 9.7 Indemnification. The Lenders agree to indemnify the Administrative
Agent in its capacity as such (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), ratably according to their respective Aggregate Exposure Percentages in effect on the date on which
indemnification is sought under this Section 9.7 (or, if indemnification is sought after the date upon which the Commitments shall have terminated and the Loans shall have been paid in full, ratably in accordance with such Aggregate Exposure
Percentages immediately prior to such date), from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever which may at any time (including at
any time following the payment of the Loans) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent in any way relating to or arising out of, the Commitments, this Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents or any documents
contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by the Administrative Agent under or in connection with any of the foregoing; provided that no Lender shall be
liable for the payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements which are found by a final and nonappealable decision of a court of competent
jurisdiction to have resulted from the Administrative Agents gross negligence or willful misconduct. The agreements in this Section 9.7 shall survive the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder. 
SECTION 9.8 Administrative Agent in Its Individual Capacity. The Administrative Agent and its affiliates may make loans to, accept
deposits from and generally engage in any kind of business with any Loan Party as though the Administrative Agent was not an Administrative Agent. With respect to its Loans made or renewed by it and with respect to any Letter of Credit issued or
participated in by it, the Administrative Agent shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as any Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not an Administrative Agent, and the terms
Lender and Lenders shall include the Administrative Agent in its individual capacity.  SECTION
9.9 Successor Administrative Agents. The Administrative Agent may resign as Administrative Agent upon 30 days notice to the Lenders and the Borrower. If the Administrative Agent shall resign as Administrative Agent under
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, then the Required Lenders shall appoint from among the Lenders a successor agent for the Lenders, which successor agent shall (unless an Event of Default under Section 8(a) or Section 8(f) with
respect to the Borrower shall have occurred and be continuing) be subject to approval by the Borrower (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), whereupon such successor agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of
the Administrative Agent, and the term Administrative Agent shall mean such successor agent effective upon such appointment and approval, and the former Administrative Agents rights, powers and duties as Administrative Agent shall
be terminated, without any other or further act or deed on the part of such former Administrative Agent or any of the parties to this Agreement or any holders of the Loans. If no successor agent has accepted appointment as Administrative Agent by
the date that is 30 days following a retiring Administrative Agents notice of resignation, the retiring Administrative Agents resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective, and the Lenders shall assume and perform all of the
duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor agent as provided for above. 
SECTION 9.10 Authorization to Release Liens. The Administrative Agent is hereby irrevocably authorized by each of the Lenders to
release any Lien covering any Property of the Borrower or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is the subject of a Disposition which is permitted by this Agreement, which has been consented to in accordance with Section 10.1 or in accordance
with Section 10.17. In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation thereof, no Hedging Agreement or Cash 
  93 





Management Agreement the obligations under which constitute Secured Hedging Obligations or Secured Cash Management Obligations, respectively, will create (or be deemed to create) in favor of any
Secured Party that is a party thereto any rights in connection with the management or release of any Collateral or of the obligations of any Loan Party under this Agreement or any other Loan Document. By accepting the benefits of the Collateral,
each Secured Party that is a party to any such Hedging Agreement or Cash Management Agreement shall be deemed to have appointed the Administrative Agent to serve as administrative agent and collateral agent under the Loan Documents and agreed to be
bound by the Loan Documents as a Secured Party thereunder, subject to the limitations set forth in this Section.  SECTION 9.11 No
Other Duties. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, none of the Arrangers, the Lead Arranger, or the syndication agent shall have any powers, duties or responsibilities under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, except
in its capacity, as applicable, as a Lender hereunder.  ARTICLE X. MISCELLANEOUS 
SECTION 10.1 Amendments and Waivers. Neither this Agreement, any other Loan Document, nor any terms hereof or thereof may be
amended, supplemented or modified except in accordance with the provisions of this Section 10.1. The Required Lenders and each Loan Party party to the relevant Loan Document may, or (with the written consent of the Required Lenders) the
Administrative Agent and each Loan Party party to the relevant Loan Document may, from time to time, (a) enter into written amendments, supplements or modifications hereto and to the other Loan Documents for the purpose of adding any provisions
to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or changing in any manner the rights of the Lenders or of the Loan Parties hereunder or thereunder or (b) waive, on such terms and conditions as the Required Lenders, or the Administrative Agent, as
the case may be, may specify in such instrument, any of the requirements of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or any Default or Event of Default and its consequences; provided that no such waiver and no such amendment, supplement or
modification shall (i) forgive all or any portion of the principal amount or any accrued but unpaid interest, or extend the final scheduled date of maturity of any Loan, extend the scheduled date of any amortization payment in respect of any
Term Loan, reduce the stated rate of any interest, fee or letter of credit commission payable hereunder or extend the scheduled date of any payment thereof, permit the duration of any Interest Period to be beyond six months, or increase the amount
or extend the expiration date of any Revolving Credit Lenders Commitment in each case without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby; (ii) eliminate or reduce the voting rights of any Lender under this
Section 10.1, reduce any percentage specified in the definition of Required Lenders, consent to the assignment or transfer by the Borrower of any of its rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, release all or
substantially all of the Collateral or release all or substantially all of the Subsidiary Guarantor from their obligations under the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement, in each case without the written consent of all Lenders; (iii) reduce the
percentage specified in the definition of Majority Facility Lenders without the written consent of all Lenders under each affected Facility; (iv) amend, modify or waive any provision of Section 2.18 without the written consent of the each
Lender in respect of each Facility directly affected thereby; (v) reduce the amount of Net Cash Proceeds required to be applied to prepay Term Loans under this Agreement without the written consent of the Majority Facility Lenders with respect
to each affected Term Loan Facility; (vi) amend, modify or waive any provision of Article IX without the written consent of the Administrative Agent; or (vii) amend, modify or waive any provision of Article III without the written consent
of the Issuing Lenders. Any such waiver and any such amendment, supplement or modification shall apply equally to each of the Lenders and shall be binding upon the Loan Parties, the Lenders, the Administrative Agent and all future holders of the
Loans. In the case of any waiver, the Loan Parties, the Lenders and the Administrative Agent shall be restored to their former position and rights hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, and any Default or Event of Default waived shall be
deemed to be cured and not continuing; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or Event of Default, or impair any right consequent thereon. 
  94 




Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may be amended with the written consent of the
Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Revolving Credit Lenders providing Extended Revolving Credit Commitments (as defined below) under the Extended Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below) to permit the extension of the Revolving Credit
Facility beyond the original Revolving Credit Termination Date (as extended, the Extended Revolving Credit Facility) and the Loans thereunder (Extended Revolving Credit Loans and the commitments thereunder,
Extended Revolving Credit Commitments); provided that (a) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or would result from any such extension of the Revolving Credit Termination Date, (b) the
aggregate Extended Revolving Credit Commitment shall not exceed the Total Revolving Credit Commitments in effect immediately prior to any such extension without the consent of the Required Lenders, (c) no Revolving Credit Lender shall have any
obligation to participate in any extension described in this paragraph unless it agrees to do so in its sole discretion, (d) the Revolving Credit Commitments of any nonparticipating Revolving Credit Lender shall terminate and the Revolving
Credit Loans of such Lender shall be due and payable on the original Revolving Credit Termination Date or such other date specified by Article VIII and (e) all other terms applicable to such Extended Revolving Credit Loans (other than terms
relating to pricing) shall be substantially identical to those applicable to the Revolving Credit Loans.  Furthermore, notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Administrative Agent, with the consent of the Borrower, may amend, modify or supplement any Loan Document without the consent of any Lender or the Required Lenders in order to correct, amend or cure any ambiguity, inconsistency or
defect or correct any typographical error or other manifest error in any Loan Document.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
(including, without limitation, this Section 10.1) or any other Loan Document to the contrary, (i) this Agreement and the other Loan Documents may be amended to effect an incremental facility or refinancing facility pursuant to
Section 2.28 or Section 2.26, as applicable (and the Administrative Agent and the Borrower may effect such amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents without the consent of any other party as may be necessary or appropriate,
in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to effect the terms of any such incremental facility or refinancing facility); (ii) no Lender consent is required to effect any amendment or supplement to any intercreditor
agreement or arrangement permitted under this Agreement that is for the purpose of adding the holders of any Indebtedness as expressly contemplated by the terms of such other intercreditor agreement or arrangement permitted under this Agreement, as
applicable (it being understood that any such amendment or supplement may make such other changes to the applicable intercreditor agreement as, in the good faith determination of the Administrative Agent in consultation with the Borrower, are
required to effectuate the foregoing; provided that such other changes are not adverse, in any material respect, to the interests of the Lenders taken as a whole); provided, further, that no such agreement shall amend, modify or
otherwise directly and adversely affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder or under any other Loan Document without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent; (iii) any provision of this Agreement or any
other Loan Document may be amended by an agreement in writing entered into by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to (x) cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect or inconsistency (as determined by the Administrative Agent and the
Borrower) or (y) effect administrative changes of a technical or immaterial nature (including to effect changes to the terms and conditions applicable solely to the Issuing Lender in respect of issuances of Letters of Credit) and such amendment
shall be deemed approved by the Lenders if the Lenders shall have received at least five Business Days prior written notice of such change and the Administrative Agent shall not have received, within five Business Days of the date of such
notice to the Lenders, a written notice from the Required Lenders stating that the Required Lenders object to such 
  95 





amendment; and (iv) guarantees, collateral documents and related documents executed by Loan Parties in connection with this Agreement may be in a form reasonably determined by the
Administrative Agent and may be, together with any other Loan Document, entered into, amended, supplemented or waived, without the consent of any other Person, by the applicable Loan Party or Loan Parties and the Administrative Agent in its or their
respective sole discretion, to (A) effect the granting, perfection, protection, expansion or enhancement of any security interest in any Collateral or additional property to become Collateral for the benefit of the Secured Parties, (B) as
required by local law or advice of counsel to give effect to, or protect any security interest for the benefit of the Secured Parties, in any property or so that the security interests therein comply with applicable requirements of law, or
(C) to cure ambiguities, omissions, mistakes or defects (as reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower) or to cause such guarantee, collateral security document or other document to be consistent with this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or any Security Document to the contrary, the Administrative Agent
may, in its sole discretion, grant extensions of time for the satisfaction of any of the requirements under Sections 6.9, 6.10 and 6.11 or any Security Documents in respect of any particular Collateral or any particular Subsidiary if it determines
that the satisfaction thereof with respect to such Collateral or such Subsidiary cannot be accomplished without undue expense or unreasonable effort or due to factors beyond the control of the Borrower and the Restricted Subsidiaries by the time or
times at which it would otherwise be required to be satisfied under this Agreement or any Security Document.  SECTION

The Borrower agrees (a) to pay or reimburse the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers and the Lead Arranger for all their reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with the development, preparation and execution of, and any amendment, supplement or modification to, this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and

amounts to be paid on the Closing Date) and from time to time thereafter on a quarterly basis or such other periodic basis as the Administrative Agent shall deem appropriate, (b) to pay or reimburse each Lender and the Administrative Agent for
all its reasonable and documented costs and expenses incurred in connection with the enforcement or preservation of any rights under this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and any such other documents, including the reasonable and documented fees
and disbursements of counsel (including the allocated fees and expenses of in-house counsel) to each Lender and of counsel to the Administrative Agent, (c) to pay, indemnify, and hold each Lender and the
Administrative Agent harmless from, any and all recording and filing fees or any amendment, supplement or modification of, or any waiver or consent under or in respect of, this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and any such other documents, and
(d) to pay, indemnify, and hold each Lender, the Administrative Agent and their respective officers, directors, trustees, employees, affiliates, agents and controlling persons (each, an indemnitee) harmless from and against
any and all other liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever 
  97 





(other than for loss of profits) with respect to the execution, delivery, enforcement, performance and administration of this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and any such other documents,
including any of the foregoing relating to the use of proceeds of the Loans or the violation of, noncompliance with or liability under, any Environmental Law applicable to the operations of the Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries or any of the
Properties and the reasonable and documented fees and expenses of legal counsel in connection with claims, actions or proceedings by any indemnitee against any Loan Party under any Loan Document (all the foregoing in this clause (d), collectively,
the indemnified liabilities); provided, that the Borrower shall have no obligation hereunder to any indemnitee with respect to indemnified liabilities to the extent such indemnified liabilities arise from (x) to the
extent they are found by a final, nonappealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such indemnitee, (y) to the extent they are found by a final, nonappealable judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction, the breach of an indemnified persons funding obligations or any other material breach by the relevant indemnitee of its obligations under the Loan Documents or (z) any dispute brought by an indemnitee against any
other indemnitee that does not involve an act or omission by the Borrower or any of its Affiliates (other than any disputes against any indemnitee in its capacity as the Administrative Agent or Lead Arranger). Without limiting the foregoing, and to
the extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower agrees not to assert and to cause its Subsidiaries not to assert, and hereby waives and agrees to cause its Subsidiaries to so waive, all rights for contribution or any other rights of recovery
with respect to all claims, demands, penalties, fines, liabilities, settlements, damages, costs and expenses of whatever kind or nature, under or related to Environmental Laws, that any of them might have by statute or otherwise against any
indemnitee. All amounts due under this Section 10.5 shall be payable not later than 10 days after written demand therefor. The agreements in this Article X shall survive repayment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder. 
SECTION 10.6 Successors and Assigns; Participations and Assignments. (a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any affiliate of the Issuing Lender that issues any Letter of Credit), except that (i) the Borrower may not assign or
otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any attempted assignment or transfer by the Borrower without such consent shall be null and void); provided that a merger,
consolidation, amalgamation or similar transaction not prohibited by this Agreement shall not constitute and assignment or transfer by the Borrower, and (ii) no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer its rights or obligations hereunder except
in accordance with this Section 10.6. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any
affiliate of the Issuing Lender that issues any Letter of Credit), Participants (to the extent provided in paragraph (c) of this Section 10.6) and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the affiliates of each of the Administrative
Agent, the Issuing Lender and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement. 
(b)    (i) Subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(ii) below, any Lender may assign to one or more assignees
(other than (A) a natural person (or any holding company, investment vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated for the primary benefit of, a natural person), (B) a Defaulting Lender, a subsidiary of a Defaulting Lender or a Person who, upon
becoming a Lender hereunder, would constitute a Defaulting Lender or a subsidiary of a Defaulting Lender, (C) a Disqualified Lender or (D) the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries) (each, an Assignee) all or a portion of its
rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitments and the Loans at the time owing to it) with the prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) of: 
(A)    the Borrower; provided that no consent of the Borrower shall be required for (1) an assignment
of Term Loans to a Lender, an affiliate of a Lender, an Approved Fund, (2) an assignment of Revolving Credit Commitments (and associated Revolving Loans) to a Revolving Credit Lender or (3) if an Event of Default under Section 7(a) or
7(f) (with respect to the Borrower) has occurred and is continuing, any other Person; provided further that the Borrower shall be deemed to have consented to any assignment of Term Loans unless the Borrower shall object thereto by
written notice to the Administrative Agent within 10 Business Days after having received notice thereof; 
  98 




(B)    the Administrative Agent; provided that no
consent of the Administrative Agent shall be required for an assignment of (x) any Revolving Credit Commitment to an Assignee that is a Revolving Credit Lender immediately prior to giving effect to such assignment or (y) all or any portion
of a Term Loan to a Lender, an affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund; and  (C)    the Issuing
Lender; provided that no consent of the Issuing Lender shall be required for an assignment of (x) any Revolving Credit Commitment to an Assignee that is a Revolving Credit Lender immediately prior to giving effect to such assignment or
(y) all or any portion of a Term Loan.  (ii) Assignments shall be subject to the following additional conditions: 
(D)    except in the case of an assignment to a Lender, an affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund or an
assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lenders Commitments or Loans under any Facility, the amount of the Commitments or Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the
Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $5,000,000 with respect to the Revolving Credit Commitments and the Revolving Credit Loans or $1,000,000 with respect to the
Term Loans (in each case, other than in the case of an assignment of all of a Lenders interests under this Agreement), unless each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent otherwise consent; provided that (1) no such consent of
the Borrower shall be required if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and (2) such amounts shall be aggregated in respect of each Lender and its Affiliates or Approved Funds, if any; 
(E)    each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of each of the
assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement; provided that this clause shall not be construed to prohibit the assignment of a proportionate part of the assigning Lenders rights and obligations in respect of the
Revolving Credit Commitments or Term Loans;  (F)    the parties to each assignment shall execute and
deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together 
  99 





with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500 (with only one such fee payable in connection with the simultaneous assignments to or by two or more Approved Funds that are administered or
managed by the same entity or affiliated entities), unless the Administrative Agent agrees to waive such fee in its sole discretion; and 
(G)    the Assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an
administrative questionnaire in which the Assignee designates one or more credit contacts to whom all syndicate-level information (which may contain material non-public information about the Borrower and its
Affiliates and their related parties or their respective securities) will be made available and who may receive such information in accordance with the assignees compliance procedures and applicable laws, including Federal and state securities
laws.  (iii)    Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to paragraph (b)(iv) below, from and after
the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption the Assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this
Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of
the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.19, 2.20, 2.21 and 10.5, except as provided in
Section 2.24) with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment; provided that, except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no assignment by a Defaulting Lender
will constitute a waiver or release of any claim against any party hereunder arising from that Lenders having been a Defaulting Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply
with this Section 10.6 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section 10.6. 
(iv)    The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices
in New York a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amount (and stated interest) of the Loans and L/C Obligations
owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the Register). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive (absent manifest error), and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender and the
Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by
the Borrower, the Issuing Lender and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. This Section 10.06(b)(iv) shall be construed so that all Loans are at all times maintained in registered
form within the meaning of Section 163(f), 871(h)(2) and 881(c)(2) of the Code and any related United States Treasury Regulations (or any other relevant or successor provisions of the Code or of such United States Treasury Regulations). 
(v)    Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption executed by an assigning Lender and an Assignee, the
Assignees completed administrative questionnaire (unless the Assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section 10.6 and any written consent to such
assignment required by paragraph (b) of this Section 10.6, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information contained therein in the Register. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of
this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph. 
  100 




(c)    (i) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower or the
Administrative Agent, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (a Participant) in all or a portion of such Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitments
and the Loans owing to it); provided that (A) such Lenders obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such
obligations and (C) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement.
Any agreement pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement;
provided that such agreement may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver that (1) requires the consent of each Lender directly affected thereby pursuant to
the proviso to the second sentence of Section 10.1 and (2) directly affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (c)(ii) of this Section 10.6, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of, and
subject to the limitations of, Sections 2.19, 2.20 and 2.21 to the same extent as if it were a Lender (subject to the limitations and requirements of those Sections (including Section 2.20(d)) applying to each Participant as if it were a
Lender, and it being understood that the documentation required under Section 2.20(d) shall be delivered to the participating Lender) and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 10.6, but to
no greater extent than such Lender. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.7(b) as though it were a Lender, but to no greater extent than such Lender; provided that such
Participant shall be subject to Section 10.7(a) as though it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a participation, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of
each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participants interest in the Loans or other obligations under this Agreement (the Participant Register); provided that no Lender shall have any
obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register to any Person (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participants interest in any Commitments, Loans, Letters of Credit or its other
obligations under any Loan Document) except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Commitment, Loan, Letter of Credit or other obligation is in registered form under
Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive, and such Lender, each Loan Party and the Administrative Agent shall treat each
person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register pursuant to the terms hereof as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. 
(ii)    A Participant (x) shall agree to be subject to the provisions of Section 2.23 and Section 2.24 as if
it were an assignee under paragraph (b) of this Section 10.6 and (y) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 2.19 or 2.20 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the
participation sold to such Participant. No Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.20 unless such Participant complies with Section 2.20(d), (e), (f) and (h) as if it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a participation
agrees, at the Borrowers request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrower to effectuate the provisions of Section 2.24 with respect to any Participant. 
(d)    Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this
Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section 10.6 shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided
that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or Assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. 
  101 




(e)    The Borrower, upon receipt of written notice from the relevant

SECTION 10.7 Adjustments; Set-off. (a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement
with respect to a particular Facility, if any Lender (a Benefitted Lender) shall at any time receive any payment of all or part of its Loans or the Reimbursement Obligations owing to it, or interest thereon, or receive any
collateral in respect thereof (whether voluntarily or involuntarily, by set-off, pursuant to events or proceedings of the nature referred to in Section 8(f), or otherwise), in a greater proportion than
any such payment to or collateral received by any other Lender, if any, in respect of such other Lenders Loans or the Reimbursement Obligations owing to such other Lender, or interest thereon, such Benefitted Lender shall purchase for cash
from the other Lenders a participating interest in such portion of each such other Lenders Loan and/or of the Reimbursement Obligations owing to each such other Lender, or shall provide such other Lenders with the benefits of any such
collateral, or the proceeds thereof, as shall be necessary to cause such Benefitted Lender to share the excess payment or benefits of such collateral or proceeds ratably with each of the Lenders; provided, however, that if all or any
portion of such excess payment or benefits is thereafter recovered from such Benefitted Lender, such purchase shall be rescinded, and the purchase price and benefits returned, to the extent of such recovery, but without interest; provided
further, that to the extent prohibited by applicable law as described in the definition of Excluded Swap Obligation, no amounts received from, or set-off with respect to, any Subsidiary
Guarantor shall be applied to any Excluded Swap Obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor.  (b)    In addition to any
rights and remedies of the Lenders provided by law, each Lender shall have the right, without prior notice to the Borrower, any such notice being expressly waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law, upon any amount becoming
due and payable by the Borrower hereunder (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) to set-off and appropriate and apply against such amount any and all deposits (general or special, time
or demand, provisional or final), in any currency, and any other credits, indebtedness or claims, in any currency, in each case whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured, at any time held or owing by such Lender or any
branch or agency thereof to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent after any such setoff and application made by such Lender; provided that the failure to
give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application.  SECTION 10.8 Counterparts. This Agreement may
be executed by one or more of the parties to this Agreement on any number of separate counterparts, and all of said counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same instrument. Delivery of an executed signature page of this
Agreement by facsimile or other electronic transmission shall be as effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart hereof. A set of the copies of this Agreement signed by all the parties shall be lodged with the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent.

jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.  SECTION
